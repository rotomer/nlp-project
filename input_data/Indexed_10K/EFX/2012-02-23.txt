BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a leading global provider of information solutions, employment, income and identity verifications and human resources business process outsourcing services. We leverage some of the largest sources of consumer and commercial data, along with advanced analytics and proprietary technology, to create customized insights which enable our business customers to grow faster, more efficiently, and more profitably, and to inform and empower consumers. Businesses rely on us for consumer and business credit intelligence, credit portfolio management, fraud detection, decisioning technology, marketing tools, and human resources and payroll services. We also offer a portfolio of products that enable individual consumers to manage their financial affairs and protect their identity. Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and among businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. Segment and Geographic Information Segments. The U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, or USCIS, segment, the largest of our five segments, consists of three product and service lines: Online Consumer Information Solutions, or OCIS; Mortgage Solutions; and Consumer Financial Marketing Services. OCIS and Mortgage Solutions revenue is principally transaction based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer credit reporting and scoring, mortgage settlement services, identity management, fraud detection and modeling services. USCIS also markets certain of our decisioning products which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer credit oriented decisions. Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit, consumer wealth or demographic information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk. The International segment consists of Latin America, Europe and Canada Consumer. Canada Consumers products and services are similar to our USCIS offerings, while Europe and Latin America are made up of varying mixes of product lines that are in our USCIS, North America Commercial Solutions and North America Personal Solutions reportable segments. The TALX Workforce Solutions segment consists of the Verification Services and Employer Services business units. Verification Services revenue is transaction based and is derived primarily from employment, income and social security number verifications. Employer Services revenues are derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. These services assist our customers with the administration of unemployment claims and employer based tax credits, the handling of certain payroll related transaction processing, and the management of the assessment of new hires. North America Personal Solutions revenue is both transaction and subscription based and is derived from the sale of credit monitoring, debt management and identity theft protection products, which we deliver to consumers through the mail and electronically via the internet. North America Commercial Solutions revenue is principally transaction based, with the remainder project based, and is derived from the sale of business information, credit scores and portfolio analytics that enable customers to utilize our reports to make financial, marketing and purchasing decisions related to businesses. 28 Geographic Information. We currently operate in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, the U.K., Uruguay, and the U.S. Our operations in the Republic of Ireland focus on data handling and customer support activities. We have an investment in the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in Brazil and offer consumer credit services in India and Russia through joint ventures. Of the countries we operate in, 74% of our revenue was generated in the U.S. during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Key Performance Indicators. Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. Key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, include the following: Key Performance Indicators Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Operating revenue $1,959.8 $1,859.5 $1,716.0 Operating revenue change 5% 8% 5% Operating income $471.0 $430.0 $381.8 Operating margin 24.0% 23.1% 22.2% Net income attributable to Equifax $232.9 $266.7 $233.9 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $1.87 $1.86 $1.70 Cash provided by operating activities $408.7 $352.6 $418.4 Capital expenditures $75.0 $99.8 $70.7 Operational and Financial Highlights. &bull;On May 31, 2011, we completed the merger of our Brazilian business with Boa Vista Servi&ccedil;os S.A. (BVS) in exchange for a 15% equity interest in BVS, which was accounted for as a sale and was deconsolidated (the Brazilian Transaction). BVS, an unrelated third party whose results we do not consolidate, is the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in Brazil. &bull;On August 2, 2011, we acquired DataVision Resources, which provides data and business solutions to the mortgage, insurance and financial services industries, for $50.0 million. DataVision Resources is part of our TALX Workforce Solutions segment. &bull;We repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $142.3 million during 2011. Business Environment, Company Outlook and Strategy Consumer and small business lending activity, is one of the key drivers of demand for our services. Lending activity is now growing at a moderate rate in most loan categories and markets around the world, but lenders continue to demonstrate caution in loan decisions due to continuing concerns about consumer and small business credit quality and about home values. Mortgage lending activity, which is an important lending category for our company, is cyclical, based on fluctuations in both home sales and refinancing activity; and mortgage activity is currently below long term average activity levels, in part due to reduced home values. In addition, new financial regulations are increasing the compliance requirements for many of our customers and introduce new challenges as well as opportunities in the marketing of our product and service offerings to our customers. Real time decision making for many of our customers has become more complex and reliant on quality data assets with broad market coverage. Our proprietary technology is efficient and sufficiently flexible to adapt to a broad array of decisioning applications. By linking data assets, we are able to develop high value solutions that improve the effectiveness of our customers decision making activities. In an effort to respond to these market conditions, we have focused on the following activities: &bull;Further diversification of our revenues by pursuing and investing in key strategic initiatives including new product innovation, differentiated decisioning solutions and analytics, leveraging and broadening our diverse data assets and enhancing our technology platforms. 29 &bull;Reorganizing our sales force with key customer teams dedicated to our largest accounts and broadening our product offerings to address the needs of our medium to smaller customers. &bull;Acquiring new data assets and technologies both domestically and internationally. &bull;Expanding and investing in attractive international markets, including Russia, India and Brazil. &bull;Continuing our focus on managing expenses through the use of LEAN and other process improvement initiatives. In 2012, we do not expect measurable improvement in the overall business environment. The environment will continue to be challenging as various countries deal with their particular political, budgetary, and economic issues. However, we currently expect that with our ongoing investments in new product innovation, technology infrastructure, strategic acquisitions, enterprise growth initiatives, and continuous process improvement will enable us to deliver long term average organic revenue growth between 6% and 8% with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions, and we expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue as a result of operating and financial leverage. The diversity of our data assets, the strength of our analytical capabilities, and our proprietary decisioning technology has enabled us to consistently deliver high value solutions that our clients integrate into their business operations. As our clients business environment becomes more difficult and competitive, these high value solutions will enable them to operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &mdash; TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 Consolidated Financial Results Operating Revenue Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Operating Revenue 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) U.S. Consumer Information Solutions $792.6 $743.0 $712.2 $49.6 7% $30.8 4% International 492.9 482.8 438.6 10.1 2% 44.2 10% TALX Workforce Solutions 404.3 395.6 346.4 8.7 2% 49.2 14% North America Personal Solutions 180.7 157.6 149.0 23.1 15% 8.6 6% North America Commercial Solutions 89.3 80.5 69.8 8.8 11% 10.7 15% Consolidated operating revenue $1,959.8 $1,859.5 $1,716.0 $100.3 5% $143.5 8% Revenue from continuing operations increased by 5% in 2011 compared to 2010. The deconsolidation of our Brazilian business, which resulted from the merger of our business into BVS during the second quarter of 2011, negatively impacted revenue by $48.7 million, compared to the prior year, while all other revenue increased by 8% compared to 2010, primarily driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives across each of our businesses. The favorable effect of foreign exchange rates, in locations other than Brazil, did not have a material impact on revenue. Revenue from continuing operations increased by 8% in 2010 compared to 2009. The favorable effect of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by $24.1 million, or 1.4%, in 2010 compared to the prior year period. Revenue grew over the prior year in each of our operating segments, primarily driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives as well as growth contributed by 2009 acquisitions in USCIS and TALX Workforce Solutions. 30 Operating Expenses Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Operating Expenses 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated cost of services $768.5 $759.9 $718.8 $8.6 1% $41.1 6% Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 554.8 507.4 470.2 47.4 9% 37.2 8% Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense 165.5 162.2 145.2 3.3 2% 17.0 12% Consolidated operating expenses $1,488.8 $1,429.5 $1,334.2 $59.3 4% $95.3 7% Cost of Services. The slight increase in cost of services from continuing operations, when compared to 2010, was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and benefits expense and contract services expenses of $31.1 million, and by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by $7.2 million, largely offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our Brazilian business. The increase in cost of services from continuing operations in 2010, when compared to 2009, was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and incentive expense of $6.3 million; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by $11.4 million; and the impact of our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of IXI Corporation and Rapid Reporting Verification Company. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense from continuing operations increased $47.4 million compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased salary and incentive expense of $33.3 million, higher advertising expenses of $9.1 million and higher severance costs offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our Brazilian business. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our selling, general and administrative expense by $5.2 million in 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations of $37.2 million in 2010 when compared to 2009, was due to changes in foreign exchange rates, which increased 2010 expense by $5.2 million, and increased salary, incentive and benefits expenses of $32.3 million, offset by $24.8 million in restructuring charges that were incurred during 2009 that did not recur in 2010. The remaining increase was primarily due to the impact of the inclusion of businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to $6.6 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of Anakam and our 2011 acquisitions partially offset by the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of TALX in 2007 which fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our Brazilian business. Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations in 2010 increased $17.0 million as compared to 2009 primarily due to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions which contributed $9.0 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense, as well as the effect of recent investments in new products and technology infrastructure. 31 Operating Income and Operating Margin Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Operating Income and Operating Margin 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated operating revenue $1,959.8 $1,859.5 $1,716.0 $100.3 5% $143.5 8% Consolidated operating expenses (1,488.8) (1,429.5) (1,334.2) (59.3) 4% (95.3) 7% Consolidated operating income $471.0 $430.0 $381.8 $41.0 10% $48.2 13% Consolidated operating margin 24.0% 23.1% 22.2% 0.9pts 0.9pts Operating income from continuing operations for 2011 increased faster than revenue due to better operating leverage from revenue growth and business mix as well as the deconsolidation of Brazil, which reduced reported revenue, but which had little impact on operating profit because it had been operating near break even. These factors resulted in operating margin improvement of 90 basis points to 24.0% compared to 2010. The increase in operating income from continuing operations and operating margin for 2010, as compared to 2009, is primarily attributed to the 8% increase in revenue and $24.8 million of restructuring charges in 2009 that did not recur in 2010. Other Expense, Net Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Other Expense, Net 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated interest expense $55.1 $56.1 $57.0 $(1.0) 2% $(0.9) 2% Consolidated other expense (income), net 7.7 (1.3) (6.2) 9.0 nm 4.9 79% Consolidated other expense, net $62.8 $54.8 $50.8 $8.0 15% $4.0 8% Average cost of debt 5.5% 5.2% 4.8% Total consolidated debt, net, at year end $1,013.2 $999.6 $1,174.1 $13.6 1% $(174.5) 15% nm not meaningful Interest expense decreased slightly in 2011, when compared to the same period in 2010, due to lower average debt balances outstanding for 2011 as compared to 2010. Our consolidated debt balance has increased at December 31, 2011, as a result of additional borrowings in the form of commercial paper, on which interest rates and accordingly interest expense are currently very low. The increase in the average cost of debt for 2011 is due to less low rate commercial paper outstanding on average year to date which caused the average cost of debt to increase as compared to the prior year period. Interest expense decreased slightly for 2010, when compared to 2009, as a decrease in our average debt balance from $1.18 billion to $1.07 billion more than offset an increase in the average interest rate on our total debt from 4.8% in 2009 to 5.2% in 2010. The increase in our average interest rate paid was caused by a reduction in short term, floating rate commercial paper, while longer term fixed rate debt outstanding remained essentially unchanged. Other expense (income), net, from continuing operations for 2011 increased $9.0 million as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the merger of our Brazilian business during the second quarter of 2011. On May 31, 2011, we completed the merger of our Brazilian business with BVS, which was accounted for as a sale and was deconsolidated, in exchange for a 15% equity interest in BVS. We recorded a $10.3 million pre tax loss on the Brazilian Transaction in other expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net, for 2010 as compared to 2009, declined, as 2009 included a $2.2 million mark to market adjustment on certain insurance policies, a $1.1 million gain on our repurchase of $7.5 million principal amount of our ten year senior notes due 2017 and a $1.3 million gain related to a litigation settlement. 32 Income Taxes Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated provision for income taxes $168.0 $131.9 $106.6 $36.1 27% $25.3 24% Effective income tax rate 41.2% 35.1% 32.2% Our effective rate was 41.2% for 2011, up from 35.1% for the same period in 2010. The 2011 rate was higher primarily due to the impact of the Brazilian Transaction which increased our effective rate by 5.2%. In addition, the 2010 rate benefited from certain state benefits that did not recur in 2011. This is partially offset by a cumulative income tax benefit resulting from the recognition of an income tax deduction related to several prior years. We expect our effective tax rate in 2012 to be in the range of 36% to 38%. Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for 2010, up from 32.2% for the same period in 2009. The 2010 rate was higher due primarily to the prior year recognition of a $7.3 million income tax benefit related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009, more favorable discrete items in 2009 related to foreign and state taxes and a 2009 investment loss in subsidiary, partially offset by a permanent federal deduction realized in 2010. Net Income Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Net Income 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (In millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated operating income $471.0 $430.0 $381.8 $41.0 10% $48.2 13% Consolidated other expense, net (62.8) (54.8) (50.8) (8.0) 15% (4.0) 8% Consolidated provision for income taxes (168.0) (131.9) (106.6) (36.1) 27% (25.3) 24% Consolidated net income from continuing operations $240.2 $243.3 $224.4 $(3.1) 1% $18.9 8% Discontinued operations, net of tax 1.5 31.5 16.1 (30.0) 95% 15.4 94% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (8.8) (8.1) (6.6) (0.7) 9% (1.5) 22% Net income attributable to Equifax $232.9 $266.7 $233.9 $(33.8) 13% $32.8 14% Diluted earnings per common share Net income from continuing operations attributable to Equifax $1.87 $1.86 $1.70 $0.01 1% $0.16 9% Discontinued operations attributable to Equifax 0.01 0.25 0.13 $(0.24) 95% $0.12 92% Net income attributable to Equifax $1.88 $2.11 $1.83 $(0.23) 11% $0.28 15% Weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share 123.7 126.5 127.9 Consolidated income from continuing operations decreased by $3.1 million, or 1%, in 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, due to the $27.8 million loss recorded on the Brazilian Transaction (reflected in other expense and income tax expense), partially offset by operating income growth of $41.0 million due to revenue growth, net of associated income taxes. Consolidated income attributable to Equifax decreased $33.8 million in 2011. In addition to improved operating results and the loss on the Brazilian Transaction described above, 2010 consolidated income from continuing operations included transaction gains from discontinued operations of $27.2 million which did not recur in 2011. The increase in net income attributable to Equifax for 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to increased income from discontinued operations, driven by a $14.9 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of DMS recorded in the third quarter of 2010 and a $12.3 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of the APPRO product line recorded in the second quarter of 2010. Net income attributed to Equifax for 2010 also benefited from higher operating income, which grew generally in line with higher revenue. 33 Segment Financial Results U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 U.S. Consumer Information Solutions 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating revenue: Online Consumer Information Solutions $519.8 $485.2 $501.4 $34.6 7% $(16.2) 3% Mortgage Solutions 119.5 113.5 99.5 6.0 5% 14.0 14% Consumer Financial Marketing Services 153.3 144.3 111.3 9.0 6% 33.0 30% Total operating revenue $792.6 $743.0 $712.2 $49.6 7% $30.8 4% % of consolidated revenue 40% 40% 41% Total operating income $287.3 $269.8 $259.4 $17.5 6% $10.4 4% Operating margin 36.2% 36.3% 36.4% 0.1pts 0.1pts U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue increased 7% in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of growth across all of our USCIS business lines. The increase in revenue for 2010, as compared to 2009, was due to growth in Mortgage Solutions along with growth due to our acquisition of IXI Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2009 partially offset by a small decline in online credit reporting revenue. OCIS. The increase in revenue for 2011, as compared to 2010, was driven by increased market volume, particularly in the credit card and auto markets; new customer wins; new service introductions; and select pricing actions in subscription and wholesale arrangements. An 11% increase in core credit decision transaction volumes was partially offset by lower average price per transaction for our transaction based revenue. Revenue for 2010, as compared to 2009, declined primarily due to a reduction of online credit decision transaction volume of 5% caused by weakness in the U.S. consumer credit markets while pricing remained relatively flat year over year. Mortgage Solutions. Revenue has increased in 2011 primarily due to increased sales of settlement services as a result of increased market share from existing customers partially offset by the declines in core mortgage reporting services due to lower refinancing activity as compared to the comparable periods of 2010. Revenue for 2010 increased, as compared to the prior year, due to favorable long term interest rates that resulted in higher consumer refinancing activity and increased home sales activity attributable to U.S. government incentives for housing purchases which expired on May 31, 2010. Consumer Financial Marketing Services. 2011 revenue increased, as compared to 2010, due to continued growth in credit based pre screen and portfolio management revenue as well as strong market penetration of wealth based consumer information services. The increase in revenue in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to our acquisition of IXI Corporation during the fourth quarter of 2009. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Operating Margin. In 2011, improved margins in online credit services and CFMS resulting from solid revenue growth were offset by lower margins in mortgage solutions due to less favorable product mix and by expense investment and increased acquisition related amortization associated with our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of Anakam. Operating margin remained relatively consistent in 2010, as compared to 2009. The margin impact of amortization expense associated with the IXI acquisition was offset by expense leveraging resulting from revenue growth and expense reductions due to certain process streamlining activities. 34 International Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 International 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating revenue: Latin America $208.8 $231.3 $200.4 $(22.5) 10% $30.9 15% Europe 158.7 137.6 138.4 21.1 15% (0.8) 1% Canada Consumer 125.4 113.9 99.8 11.5 10% 14.1 14% Total operating revenue $492.9 $482.8 $438.6 $10.1 2% $44.2 10% % of consolidated revenue 25% 26% 26% Total operating income $132.2 $119.4 $118.9 $12.8 11% $0.5 0% Operating margin 26.8% 24.7% 27.1% 2.1pts 2.4pts International revenue increased by 2% in 2011 as compared to 2010.

Local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, increased 12% due to solid growth in Europe, Canada and other Latin American countries. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar, excluding Brazil, favorably impacted our International revenue by $12.0 million, or 3%. International revenue increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to strong growth in Latin America and the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our International revenue by $21.8 million, or 5%. In local currency, International revenue was up 5% in 2010. Latin America. Revenue decreased by 10% in 2011 as compared to 2010. While the deconsolidation of Brazil negatively impacted revenue by $48.7 million in 2011, revenue in our other Latin American countries increased 18% in 2011 as compared to 2010. Local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, increased by 17% due to broad based growth across other Latin American countries. The favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, excluding Brazil, added $1.0 million, or 1%, to revenue in 2011. Revenue increased for 2010, as compared to the prior year by $30.9 million, or 15%, partially due to the favorable foreign currency impact of $14.3 million, or 7%. In local currency, revenue increased 8% from 2009. Local currency revenue increased in most of our Latin American geographies, resulting from broad based growth across all product segments, partially offset by a modest decline in Brazil. Europe. Revenue increased 15% in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to increased sales in most product segments and the impact of a first quarter 2011 acquisition, as well as the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. In local currency, revenue was up 11% in 2011. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by $6.0 million, or 4%. The slight decrease in revenue for 2010, as compared to 2009, was due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $3.2 million, or 3%. In local currency, revenue increased 2%, as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due to growth in online transactions and a higher volume of subscriptions in the U.K. as well as higher registries usage in Spain and Portugal offset by declines in some of our other product segments. Canada Consumer. Revenue increased 10% compared to the same period in 2010 due to increased volumes for our technology and analytical services products, primarily due to growth in the customer base for a fraud mitigation product, and the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. In local currency, revenue was up 6% in 2010. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by $5.1 million, or 4%. The $14.1 million increase in revenue for 2010, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to favorable foreign currency impact of $10.6 million, or 11%. In local currency, revenue increased 3% when compared to 2009. The increase in local currency was due to increased volumes for our technology and analytical services products primarily due to growth in the customer base for a new fraud mitigation product. 35 International Operating Margin. Operating margin increased in 2011 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the deconsolidation of our Brazilian business, whose margins had declined in recent periods. The 2011 operating margins were also impacted by increased investments in new product development and increased sales force, particularly in Brazil prior to the deconsolidation of the business. Operating margin decreased for 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to a shift in product mix and increased operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 8% for 2010, in local currency, when compared to 2009, due to increased revenue and expense investments in new product development and increased sales force, particularly in Brazil. TALX Workforce Solutions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 TALX Workforce Solutions 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating Revenue: Verfication Services $192.5 $183.4 $134.6 $9.1 5% $48.8 36% Employer Services 211.8 212.2 211.8 (0.4) 0% 0.4 0% Total operating revenue $404.3 $395.6 $346.4 $8.7 2% $49.2 14% % of consolidated revenue 21% 21% 20% Total operating income $90.7 $92.1 $75.4 $(1.4) 2% $16.7 22% Operating margin 22.4% 23.3% 21.8% 0.9pts 1.5pts Verification Services. Revenue from Verification Services increased in 2011, compared to the prior year period, as high single digit percentage revenue growth in verifications provided to non mortgage customers and the benefit of our third quarter 2011 acquisition of DataVision Resources were partially offset by high single digit declines in verification revenue from mortgage customers due to reduced mortgage activity. Revenue increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to mid double digit growth from traditional employment based verification, with strong demand across each of the mortgage, pre employment screening, social services and collections sectors; and due to the impact of our acquisition of Rapid Reporting Verification Company in the fourth quarter of 2009. Employer Services. Revenue for 2011 as compared to 2010 slightly decreased. Declines in our talent recruitment and management services business due to decreased government hiring activity at the U.S. Transportation Security Administration and reduced licensing revenue were offset by revenue growth in our complementary services business. The slight increase in revenue during 2010, as compared to the prior year, resulted from growth in our complementary services and as well as growth in our talent recruitment and management services business due to increased government hiring activity at the U.S. Transportation and Security Administration and other large government customers. This was partially offset by expected declines in our Tax Management Services business driven primarily by decreases in unemployment compensation claims activity. TALX Workforce Solutions Operating Margin. Operating margin for 2011, when compared to the prior year period, decreased due to revenue and associated margin declines in government based tax transcript verification services and talent recruitment and management services as a result of a slowdown in mortgage related activity and decreased license revenue, respectively. There was also increased acquisition related amortization associated with our two acquisitions in the latter half of 2011. Operating margin increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due to continued revenue growth, while operating expenses grew at a slower rate due to the leveraging of certain fixed operational and overhead costs and certain operating process efficiencies for both periods.

Equifax branded subscription revenue was up 17% from the prior year, driven by both higher subscription sales and higher average revenue per subscriber due to new product offerings and better market segmentation. Revenue from wholesalers, which benefited from more favorable pricing, and from Canada also contributed to growth, while data breach services and transaction based services each declined modestly. The operating margin increase in 2011, as compared to 2010, was primarily due to the increased revenue along with a shift in product mix to higher margin products. The increase in revenue for 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to increased direct to customer, Equifax branded subscription service revenue, which was up 11% from 2009, driven by higher average revenue per subscriber due to new product offerings and better market segmentation. The increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by lower transaction sales and lower corporate breach revenues. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the revenue growth and operating efficiencies.

In local currency, revenue increased 10% compared 2010 primarily due to increases in U.S. risk and marketing service revenue and revenue from our data management products. The favorable impact of changes in the U.S.&mdash;Canadian foreign exchange rate impacted revenue by $1.0 million, or 1%, as compared to the prior year. Operating margin also increased for 2011, as compared 2010, due to strong revenue growth and the margin leverage which results from a partially fixed cost business. Revenue increased for 2010, as compared to 2009, $10.7 million, or 15%. The favorable impact of changes in the U.S. &ndash; Canadian foreign exchange rate increased revenue by $2.3 million, or 3%. In local currency, revenue increased 12% in 2010 compared to the prior year. The local currency increase was primarily due to increases in U.S. risk and marketing service revenue and revenue from our data management products. Online transaction volume for U.S. commercial credit information products for 2010 increased when compared to the prior year. Operating margin increased for 2010, as compared to 2009, as the rapid rate of revenue growth exceeded growth in operating expenses. General Corporate Expense Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 General Corporate Expense 2011 2010 2009 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) General corporate expense $116.9 $115.4 $121.3 $1.5 1% $(5.9) 5% Our general corporate expenses are costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction, such as shared services, administrative, legal, equity compensation costs and restructuring expenses. General corporate expenses increased by $1.5 million in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to higher salary and incentive costs partially offset by lower technology costs and professional fees. General corporate expenses decreased for 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of $24.8 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2009 that did not recur in 2010. This was partially offset by increased salary, benefit and incentive costs, upgrades in shared corporate technology, and acquisition related expenses. 37 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. We continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure to meet short and long term objectives. Sources and Uses of Cash Funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements (such as capital expenditures, interest payments, potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments) for the foreseeable future. In the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate, we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the Senior Credit Facility as described below. During the first quarter, we extended the maturity date of our Senior Credit Facility from July 2011 to February 2015 and reduced the borrowing limits from $850.0 million to $500.0 million. At December 31, 2011, $468.6 million was available to borrow under our Senior Credit Facility. Our Senior Credit Facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition, as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement. Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in millions) Operating activities $408.7 $352.6 $418.4 $56.1 $(65.8) Investing activities $(204.1) $1.0 $(270.1) $(205.1) $271.1 Financing activities $(195.9) $(335.3) $(108.3) $139.4 $(227.0) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for 2011 increased by $56.1 million over the prior year. Cash provided from net income, adjusted for the impact of divestitures, increased by $20.3 million. The remaining increase in cash from operations was primarily driven by changes in net working capital and other balance sheet changes, most notably from a $10.0 million decrease in pension contributions in 2011 and other lesser changes in liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to revenue growth. The decrease in operating cash flow for 2010 was primarily driven by $35.0 million of additional pension contributions; a $16.4 million net impact on use of funds as accounts receivable, which had been reduced in 2009, grew in 2010 as revenue grew; and $42.0 million in taxes paid on the sale of DMS and the APPRO product line. These, and other lesser changes in assets and liabilities, more than offset increased net income and the contribution from higher depreciation and amortization. 38 Fund Transfer Limitations. The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments; these restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. We currently hold $106.0 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries. Investing Activities Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash used in: 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in millions) Capital expenditures $75.0 $99.8 $70.7 $(24.8) $29.1 Our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, the licensing of software applications and investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements. Capital expenditures in 2011 were lower than 2010 primarily due to the purchase of our headquarters building in Atlanta, Georgia during the first quarter of 2010 for cash consideration of $29.0 million, partially offset by an increase in investments in new products and technology infrastructure in 2011. Capital expenditures in 2010 were higher than 2009 due to the purchase of our headquarters building in Atlanta, as noted above. On February 27, 2009, we notified the lessor of our headquarters building that we intended to exercise our purchase option in accordance with the lease terms. We purchased the building for $29.0 million on February 26, 2010. The notice of our intent to exercise our purchase option caused us to account for this lease obligation as a capital lease. We recorded the building and the related obligation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009. 39 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash used in: 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in millions) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired $(127.4) $(82.6) $(196.0) $(44.8) $113.4 Proceeds received from divestitures $2.5 $181.7 $ $(179.2) $181.7 Investment in unconsolidated affiliates, net $(4.2) $1.7 $(3.4) $(5.9) $5.1 2011 Acquisitions and Investments. On August 1, 2011, to further enhance our market position, we acquired DataVision Resources, which provides data and business solutions to the mortgage, insurance and financial services, for $50.0 million. The results of this acquisition have been included in our TALX Workforce Solutions segment. To further broaden our product offerings, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, we completed a number of smaller acquisitions of information services businesses in the European and Latin American regions of our International segment as well as our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions and TALX Workforce Solutions segments. The results of these acquisitions are not material. During the second quarter of 2010, we sold our APPRO product line, generating cash proceeds of approximately $67 million. Approximately $5 million of the purchase price was paid by the acquirer into an escrow account that will release to us, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, over the two year period following the sale. We received $2.5 million from the escrow account during the second quarter of 2011. During 2011, we also invested $4.2 million in our joint ventures in India and Russia. 2010 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments. On October 1, 2010, we acquired Anakam, Inc., a provider of large scale, software based, multi factor identity authentication solutions for $64.3 million. The results of this acquisition are included in our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment. To further enhance our market share, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we completed four acquisitions totaling $12.3 million, net of cash acquired. These transactions were in our International segment and the results of these acquisitions are not material. During 2010, we resolved a contingent earn out associated with a 2008 acquisition included in our TALX segment. The earn out of $6 million was measured on the completion of 2009 revenue targets and was accrued at December 31, 2009. On April 23, 2010, we sold our Equifax Enabling Technologies LLC legal entity, consisting of our APPRO loan origination software business (APPRO) for approximately $72 million. On July 1, 2010, we sold the assets of our Direct Marketing Services division (DMS) for approximately $117 million. Both of these were previously reported in our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment. We have presented the APPRO and DMS operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The discontinued operations are further described in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 2009 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments. On December 23, 2009, as a part of our long term growth strategy of expanding into emerging markets, we formed a joint venture, Equifax Credit Information Services Private Limited, or ECIS, to provide a broad range of credit data and information solutions in India. We paid cash consideration of $5.2 million for our 49 percent equity interest in ECIS. On November 2, 2009, to further enhance our income and identity verification service offerings, we acquired Rapid Reporting Verification Company, a provider of IRS tax transcript information and social security number authentication services, for $72.5 million. The results of this acquisition have been included in our TALX Workforce Solutions operating segment subsequent to the acquisition. 40 On October 27, 2009, we acquired IXI Corporation, a provider of consumer wealth and asset data, for $124.0 million. This acquisition enables us to offer more differentiated and in depth consumer income, wealth and other data to help our clients improve their marketing, collections, portfolio management and customer management efforts across different product segments. The results of this acquisition have been included in our USCIS operating segment subsequent to the acquisition date. We financed these purchases through borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility, which were subsequently refinanced through the issuance in November 2009 of our 4.45%, five year unsecured Senior Notes. The 4.45% Senior Notes are further described in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. On August 12, 2009, in order to enhance our Mortgage Solutions business market share, we acquired certain assets and specified liabilities of a small mortgage credit reporting reseller for cash consideration of $3.8 million. The results of this acquisition have been included in our USCIS segment subsequent to the acquisition date. For additional information about our acquisitions, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Financing Activities Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in millions) Net short term borrowings (repayments) $24.4 $(134.0) $101.8 $158.4 $(235.8) Net borrowings (repayments) under long term revolving credit facilities $ $(5.0) $(415.2) $5.0 $410.2 Payments on long term debt $(16.7) $(20.8) $(31.8) $4.1 $11.0 Proceeds from issuance of long term debt $ $ $274.4 $ $(274.4) Credit Facility Availability. Our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which we refer to as the Senior Credit Facility, permits us to borrow up to $500.0 million through February 2015. The Senior Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Availability of the Senior Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and, pursuant to our existing Board of Directors authorization, by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper (CP) notes. Our $500.0 million CP program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of CP with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. We may use the proceeds of CP for general corporate purposes. The CP program is supported by our Senior Credit Facility and, pursuant to our existing Board of Directors authorization, the total amount of CP which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. We had a 364 day revolving credit agreement with a Canadian bank (our Canadian Credit Facility) which permitted us to borrow up to C$10.0 million (denominated in Canadian dollars). The Canadian Credit Facility was scheduled to terminate in June 2011. We cancelled this agreement at the end of the first quarter 2011 and there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement at the time of cancellation. At December 31, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility and $30.0 million outstanding under our CP program. At December 31, 2011, a total of $468.6 million was available under our Senior Credit Facility. At December 31, 2011, approximately 68% of our debt was fixed rate and 32% was effectively variable rate. Our variable rate debt, consisting of our five year senior notes due 2014 (against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates), generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate (LIBOR) or on CP rates for investment grade issuers. The interest rates reset periodically, depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements. At December 31, 2011, interest rates on our variable rate debt ranged from 0.48% to 2.5%. Borrowing and Repayment Activity. Net short term borrowings (repayments) primarily represent activity under our CP program, as well as activity under our Canadian short term revolving credit agreement. Net (repayments) borrowings under long term revolving credit facilities relates to activity on our Senior Credit Facility. We primarily borrow under our CP program, when available. 41 The increase in net short term borrowings (repayments) primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of CP notes at December 31, 2011 as compared to a net repayment of $134.0 million of CP notes during 2010 as we decreased our use of CP to fund our capital needs. The change in net short term (repayments) borrowings in 2010 primarily reflects the net repayment of $134.0 million of CP notes since December 31, 2009. The decrease in net repayments under long term revolving credit facilities represents the 2010 repayment of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2009, under our Senior Credit Facility. The change in net repayments for 2010 under long term revolving credit facilities represents the 2009 repayment of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008, under our Senior Credit Facility as we decreased our use of CP to fund our capital needs in 2009 and 2010. The 2009 repayment of these borrowing drove the increase in net (repayments) borrowings for 2009. In 2009, we purchased $7.5 million principal amount of our outstanding ten year senior notes due 2017 for $6.3 million and $25.0 million principal amount of our outstanding debentures due 2028 for $25.1 million. On November 4, 2009, we issued $275.0 million principal amount of 4.45%, five year senior notes in an underwritten public offering. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to repay amounts outstanding under our CP program, a portion of which was used to finance our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions. In conjunction with our 2009 sale of five year senior notes, we entered into five year interest rate swaps, designated as fair value hedges, which convert the debts fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Debt Covenants. Our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. In addition, our Senior Credit Facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, and limit the amount of subsidiary debt. Our leverage ratio was 1.61 at December 31, 2011. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and, as of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt; however, our senior notes, discussed above, contain change in control provisions. If we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by Standard & Poors, or S&P, and Moodys Investors Service, or Moodys, below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Credit Ratings. Credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, S&P and Moodys, use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moodys, respectively. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Long term ratings of BBB and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moodys, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. At December 31, 2011, the long term ratings for our obligations were BBB+ and Baa1, which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at December 31, 2010. A downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our CP program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue CP. If our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. In addition, the markets demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment. 42 For additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Equity Transactions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in millions) Treasury stock purchases $(142.3) $(167.5) $(23.8) $25.2 $(143.7) Dividends paid to Equifax shareholders $(78.1) $(35.2) $(20.2) $(42.9) $(15.0) Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests $(5.6) $(5.1) $(4.0) $(0.5) $(1.1) Proceeds from exercise of stock options $23.7 $29.3 $10.2 $(5.6) $19.1 Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans $1.2 $3.5 $1.3 $(2.3) $2.2 Sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: &bull;Under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, we purchased 4.2 million, 5.2 million, and 0.9 million common shares on the open market during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for $142.3 million, $167.5 million and $23.8 million, respectively, at an average price per common share of $34.19, $32.28 and $26.41, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $112.1 million remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. &bull;During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid cash dividends to Equifax shareholders of $78.1 million, $35.2 million and $20.2 million, respectively, at $0.64 per share for 2011, $0.28 per share for 2010 and $0.16 per share for 2008. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011. The table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time. Some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table. Payments due by Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Thereafter (In millions) Debt (including capitalized lease obligation) (1) $999.2 $46.6 $305.1 $ $647.5 Operating leases (2) 92.2 18.6 24.8 13.9 34.9 Data processing, outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations (3) 153.3 77.6 69.6 3.8 2.3 Other long term liabilities (4) (6) 102.4 6.0 12.8 9.6 74.0 Interest payments (5) 685.7 52.8 102.3 86.6 444.0 $2,032.8 $201.6 $514.6 $113.9 $1,202.7 (1)The amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling $1.8 million and fair value adjustments of $15.8 million at December 31, 2011. Total debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments. (2)Our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment, which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048. (3)These agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. These agreements expire between 2011 and 2018. 43 (4)These long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension, postretirement and other compensation related plans, some of which are discounted in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments. In the table above, we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations, as such required funding amounts beyond 2011 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance. (5)For future interest payments on variable rate debt, which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate (LIBOR) or on CP rates for investment grade issuers, we used the variable rate in effect at December 31, 2011 to calculate these payments. Our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011, consisted of CP, borrowings under our credit facilities and our five year senior notes due 2014 (against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates). Future interest payments related to our Senior Credit Facility and our CP program are based on the borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2011 through their respective maturity dates, assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time. The variable portion of the rate at December 31, 2011 ranged from 0.48% to 2.5% for all of our variable rate debt. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates. (6)This table excludes $25.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. A potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to Computer Sciences Corporation, or CSC, if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to August 2013. The option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option. We estimate that if the option had been exercised at December 31, 2011, the price would have been in the range of approximately $650 million to $750 million. This estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business (based on limited information available to us), current market conditions and other factors, all of which are subject to constant change. Therefore, the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate. Our agreement with CSC, which expires on July 31, 2018, also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of CSC while the agreement is in effect. If CSC were to exercise its option, or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option, then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding. We believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing. However, the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors, including credit market conditions, the state of the equity markets, general economic conditions, our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition. 44 Off Balance Sheet Transactions We do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds, we transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with costs of $65.3 million and $47.9 million, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to a local governmental authority in the U.S. to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development. The title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds. These fixed assets are still recognized on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the Company. Letters of Credit and Guarantees We will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. The aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at December 31, 2011, and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less. Guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. The maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at December 31, 2011. Benefit Plans Prior to December 31, 2009, we had one non contributory qualified retirement plan covering most U.S. salaried employees (the Equifax Inc. Pension Plan, or EIPP), a qualified retirement plan that covered U.S. salaried employees (the U.S. Retirement Income Plan, or USRIP) who terminated or retired before January 1, 2005 and a defined benefit plan for most salaried and hourly employees in Canada (the Canadian Retirement Income Plan, or CRIP). On December 31, 2009, the plan assets and obligations of the EIPP were merged with the USRIP. The USRIP remained as the sole U.S. qualified retirement plan. At December 31, 2011, the USRIP met or exceeded ERISAs minimum funding requirements. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we made contributions of $40.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, to the USRIP. We also contributed $2.6 and $1.6 million to the CRIP during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. We believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities. For our non U.S., tax qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. For the non qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For additional information about our benefit plans, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Seasonality We experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. Revenue generated from the Employer Services business unit within the TALX Workforce Solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of Form W 2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year. Revenue from our OCIS and Mortgage Solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions, most commonly the second and third calendar quarters. Revenues in our North America Commercial business and the Consumer Financial Marketing Services business line within USCIS are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of project based agreements. On a consolidated basis, combining all of these businesses, and assuming normal economic conditions, first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year, and the fourth quarter is the highest. 45 Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. We generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. This requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income. We also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured, the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis, in which case revenue is recognized, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, when the services are provided. A smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscription based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period, generally one year. Revenue related to subscription based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided, using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed. Any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period. Revenue related to subscription based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term. Revenue is recorded net of sales taxes. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 46 The determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past. We monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. If we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. Also within our TALX Workforce Solutions operating segment, the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients. Revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones, upon calculation of the credit, or when the credit is utilized by our client, depending on the provisions of the client contract. We have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements. The multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information, file updates for certain solutions, services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel, training services, statistical models and other services. To account for each of these elements separately, the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer, and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements. If we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting, we apply one of the accounting policies described above. This may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract. Many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments. No individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or, in most cases, purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement. Some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases. These development services do not meet the requirement for having stand alone value, thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service. Revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract. We have some multiple element arrangements that include software. We recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery, in accordance with the applicable guidance. We record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction. Deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having stand alone value discussed above. Deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. Judgments and uncertainties &mdash; Each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables. These considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value; concluding when the element will be delivered; evaluating collectability; and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services. In addition, the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. 47 Effects if actual results differ from assumptions &mdash; We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past. We monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. If we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future, we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually (as of September 30) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance or trends, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have ten reporting units comprised of Consumer Information Solutions (which includes part of Online Consumer Information Solutions, Mortgage Solutions and Consumer Financial Marketing Services), Identity Management (part of Online Consumer Information Solutions), Europe, Latin America, Canada Consumer, North America Personal Solutions, North America Commercial Solutions, Verification Services, Tax Management Services (part of Employer Services) and Talent Management Services (part of Employer Services). The goodwill balance at December 31, 2011, for our ten reporting units was as follows: December 31, 2011 (In millions) Consumer Information Solutions $583.9 ID Management 54.5 Europe 114.3 Latin America 204.0 Canada Consumer 30.2 North America Personal Solutions 1.8 North America Commercial Solutions 37.4 Verification Services 740.1 Tax Management Services 168.9 Talent Management Services 26.1 Total goodwill $1,961.2 As permitted by applicable accounting rules, the fair values of Consumer Information Solutions, Latin America, Europe, Canada Consumer, North America Personal Solutions, and North America Commercial Solutions were not calculated at September 30, 2011 as (a) the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since their most recent fair value determination, (b) the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin and (c) based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote. Judgments and Uncertainties &mdash; In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units business enterprise value. 48 Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and long term revenue growth rates, operating margins for each reporting unit, discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges. The assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, for benchmark companies. We believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks, participate in similar markets, provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly. The companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our Competition discussion in Item 1 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information. ID Management has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type, such as Experian Group Limited and The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. Verification Services, Tax Management Services and Talent Management Services share a different set of benchmark companies, notably ADP and Paychex Inc., as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units. Valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting units operating result with the comparable companies information. In addition to these financial considerations, qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple. The values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting units fair value. We use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units. This approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach, with 70% of the value coming from the income approach. We believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations. The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value. We have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test. Growth Assumptions The assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance, the details of which are described in our Managements Discussion & Analysis of operating performance. Additionally, we consider the impact that known economic, industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts, as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives, client service and retention standards, and cost management programs. At the end of the forecast period, the long term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally 3% to 5% based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as GDP, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. As a result of the slow rate of economic recovery, we projected only modest revenue growth in 2012 for our reporting units in completing our 2011 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units, such as continued demand for employment verification services and government hiring activity at the U.S. Transportation and Security Administration in the Verification Services and Talent Management Services reporting units. The anticipated revenue growth, however, is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth. Our 2011 long term forecast is not dependent upon strong recovery of the global economy in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units. 49 Discount Rate Assumptions We utilize a weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. We believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. To calculate the WACC, the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures. The cost of equity was computed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model which considers the risk free interest rate, beta, equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit. The cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the Companys tax rate. For the 2011 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated ranged from 9% to 10%. Because of assigned market premiums, discount rates are lowest for reporting units, whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve, their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors. Where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition, the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit. Estimated Fair Value and Sensitivities The estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2011 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above, incorporating the related projections and assumptions. An indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. The estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of September 30, 2011. As a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. For example, an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. The excess of fair value over carrying value for the Companys reporting units that were valued as of September 30, 2011, ranged from approximately 19% to 86%. The reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our Talent Management Services business which has a goodwill balance of $26.1 million as of September 30, 2011. This reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity. While no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of September 30, 2011, if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecast or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit, there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and may possibly result in the recognition of an impairment loss. No new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2011, thus no impairment testing was updated as of December 31, 2011. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions &mdash; We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. 50 Loss Contingencies We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. We determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote. Judgments and uncertainties &mdash; We periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the estimated settlement costs. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. Our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions &mdash; We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material. Income Taxes We record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. We assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable. Our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. We record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. We assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals. Judgments and uncertainties &mdash; We consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. These judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. At December 31, 2011, $25.1 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $4.6 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months. 51 Effect if actual results differ from assumptions &mdash; Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans We consider accounting for our U.S. and Canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, salary growth, expected return on plan assets, interest cost and mortality and retirement rates. Actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost. Judgments and uncertainties &mdash; We believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are (1) the discount rate and (2) the expected return on plan assets, in each case as it relates to our U.S. pension plan. Our Canadian plan is small, and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material. We determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality, fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date. Discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. We use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates. The yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period, from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class, as provided by our external investment advisor. In setting the long term expected rate of return, management considers capital markets future expectations and the asset mix of the plan investments. Prior to 2008, the U.S. Pension Plan compound annual investment returns were 10.9%, 13.0% and 7.5% over three, five and ten years, respectively. The returns exceeded the S&P 500 returns for similar periods of time primarily due to an asset allocation strategy where large allocations to alternative asset classes (hedge fund of funds, private equity, real estate and real assets) provided consistently higher returns with a low correlation to equity market returns. These returns historically demonstrate a long term record of producing returns at or above the expected rate of return. However, the dramatic adverse market conditions in 2008 skewed the traditional measures of long term performance, such as the ten year average return. The severity of the 2008 losses, approximately negative 20%, makes the historical ten year average return a less accurate predictor of future return expectations. Our weighted average expected rate of return for 2012 is 7.73% which is the same as the 2011 and 2010 expected rate. Annual differences, if any, between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain, a component of other comprehensive income. In calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, we use a market related value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years. The resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive. The market related value of our assets was $625.7 million at December 31, 2011. We do not expect our 2012 net periodic benefit cost, which includes the effect of the market related value of assets, to be materially different than our 2011 cost. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions &mdash; We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations. Adjusting our weighted average expected long term rate of return (7.73% at December 31, 2011) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2012 by approximately $3.1 million. Adjusting our weighted average discount rate (4.60% at December 31, 2011) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2012 by approximately $1.4 million. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material. 52 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities, and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge certain of these exposures. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do transact business in other currencies, primarily the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Chilean peso, the Argentine peso and the Euro. For most of these foreign currencies, we are a net recipient, and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We are required to translate, or express in U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year. We record the resulting translation adjustment, and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income, as a component of our shareholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which have historically been immaterial, are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. For the year ended December 31, 2011, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2011 would have increased our revenue by $50.2 million and our pre tax operating profit by $15.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2010 would have increased our revenue by $49.6 million and our pre tax operating profit by $13.7 million. A 10% stronger U.S. dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for 2011 and 2010. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate, long term Senior Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings, as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate. We attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt, and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt. At December 31, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.3% and weighted average life of debt was 10.8 years. At December 31, 2011, 68% of our debt was fixed rate, and the remaining 32% was variable rate after giving effect to the interest rate swaps on our 2014 bonds. Occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps. A 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would have increased our 2011 interest expense by $2.8 million. Based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt, we have material exposure to interest rate risk. In the future, if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variable rate debt, we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk. The nature and amount of our long term and short term debt, as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt, can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. 53
