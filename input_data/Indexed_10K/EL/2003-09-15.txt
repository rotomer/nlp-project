ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition; concentration of credit risk; inventory; pension and other postretirement benefit costs; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; and derivatives. REVENUE RECOGNITION Generally, revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer. We report our sales levels on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns. As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested, authorized and approved. In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollar for dollar basis. Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales. This accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual returns by region and product category. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated events. As a percentage of gross sales, sales returns were 5.2%, 4.9% and 4.9% in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK An entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers. Such risks of loss manifest themselves differently, depending on the nature of the concentration, and vary in significance. We have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for approximately $1.24 billion, or 24%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2003 and $179.8 million, or 28%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2003. These customers sell products primarily within North America. Although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows, and or financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of $31.8 million and $30.6 million as of June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings. This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends. INVENTORY We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale. The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead. We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value, based on various product sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales. In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust based noncontributory defined benefit pension plan ("U.S. Plan"); an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations; a contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation; and certain other postretirement benefits. 17 The amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables. Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels. We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings. The pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds. At June 30, 2003, we used a pre retirement discount rate for our U.S. Plan of 5.75% and varying rates on our international plans of between 2.75% and 7.0%. For fiscal 2003, we used an expected return on plan assets of 8.5% for our U.S. Plan and varying rates of between 4.5% and 8.25% for our international plans. In determining the long term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies. The U.S. Plan asset allocation as of June 30, 2003 was approximately 58% equity investments, 23% fixed income investments, 13% cash and 6% other investments. For fiscal 2004, we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the U.S. Plan of 5.75% and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 8.00%. The change in this assumption from that used in fiscal 2003 will cause an increase in pension expense in fiscal 2004. We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets. Other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized. On an annual basis, we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. To determine the fair value of these intangible assets, there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing. We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose. To mitigate undue influence, we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Additionally, we evaluate our recorded goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. INCOME TAXES We have accounted for, and currently account for, income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This Statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding years. It requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. As of June 30, 2003, we have current net deferred tax assets of $116.0 million and non current net deferred tax assets of $38.7 million. These net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of current tax rates. Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately $2.9 million for deferred tax assets, which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date, where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction. Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required. If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time. Furthermore, we provide tax reserves for Federal, state and international exposures relating to audit results, planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities. The development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. DERIVATIVES We currently account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This Statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value. 18 We currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed and monitored by our employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments. Variables that are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories. The following is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2 and Note 18 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the "other" category.

We have presented these reconciliations because of the special nature of the charges or the fact that they are not necessarily comparable from period to period. We believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of operations. This is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods. While we consider the non GAAP financial measures useful in analyzing our results, it is not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. 20 The table below reconciles the fiscal 2003 results as reported and results prior to adjustment for a special pre tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share, in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants (see "Item 3. Legal Proceedings."). The amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year and we do not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future.

The restructuring charges were related to repositioning certain businesses as part of a globalization and reorganization initiative and are described in greater detail in Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The restructuring and the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement were not considered part of our core business operations in fiscal 2002. Management also excludes the related charges in evaluating its performance when comparing fiscal 2002 to future periods.

We adopted a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, our first since the initial public offering in 1995. The particular restructuring and special charges relating to the plan are described in Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These costs, as well as those resulting from the adoption of new accounting standards, were not considered part of our core business in fiscal 2001. Management also excludes the related charges in evaluating its performance when comparing fiscal 2001 to future periods.

Product category results were led by skin care, and our regions were led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa, where results benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates to the U.S. dollar and improvements in the travel retail business. Travel retail improved during the middle of fiscal 2003 compared with lower results during the middle of fiscal 2002 but was adversely affected during the last quarter of fiscal 2003 by certain world events, including the lingering effects of the war in Iraq and concerns relating to SARS. Such events may affect our future sales and earnings. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 4%. PRODUCT CATEGORIES SKIN CARE Net sales of skin care products increased 11% or $190.4 million to $1,893.7 million, which was primarily attributable to the recent launches of Perfectionist Correcting Serum for Lines/Wrinkles and Resilience Lift OverNight Face and Throat Creme by Estee Lauder, and the Repairwear line of products and Advanced Stop Signs from Clinique. Additionally, the increase was supported by strong sales of Comforting Cream Cleanser, Moisture Surge Extra Thirsty Skin Relief and Moisture Surge Eye Gel, and products in the 3 Step Skin Care System by Clinique, as well as by Re Nutriv Ultimate Lifting Creme from Estee Lauder, and A Perfect World line of products by Origins. Partially offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Stop Signs, Total Turnaround Cream and Turnaround Cream by Clinique and Idealist Skin Refinisher by Estee Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%. MAKEUP Makeup net sales increased 7% or $118.9 million to $1,909.4 million due to strong sales of our makeup artist lines and current year launches of Dewy Smooth Anti Aging Makeup and Colour Surge Lipstick by Clinique, and MagnaScopic Maximum Volume Mascara and Artists Lip and Eye Pencils from Estee Lauder. Also contributing to growth were strong sales from Estee Lauder brand products including So Ingenious Multi Dimension Liquid Makeup and Loose Powder, as well as from new and existing products in the Pure Color line. Offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Sumptuous Lipstick from Estee Lauder, and Gentle Light Makeup and Powder and High Impact Eye Shadow Duos by Clinique. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 4%. FRAGRANCE Net sales of fragrance products increased 4% or $42.3 million to $1,059.6 million, primarily reflecting the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. The fragrance industry continues to experience a difficult environment. The travel retail business, which depends substantially on fragrance products, began to improve in the middle of the fiscal year relative to the prior year, however the latter part of fiscal 2003 was adversely affected by international uncertainties stemming from events in Iraq and concerns relating to SARS. In fiscal 2003, we successfully launched Estee Lauder pleasures intense, T girl by Tommy Hilfiger, Clinique Happy Heart, Lauder Intuition for Men and Donna Karan Black Cashmere. Net sales also benefited from strong sales of Beautiful by Estee Lauder and Aromatics Elixir from Clinique. Offsetting these increases and sales from new product launches were lower net sales of certain Tommy Hilfiger products, Intuition by Estee Lauder and Estee Lauder pleasures. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales were relatively unchanged from the prior year. HAIR CARE Hair care net sales increased 6% or $13.1 million to $228.9 million. This increase was primarily the result of sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products. We also increased the number of Company owned Aveda Experience Centers and strategically decreased the number of salons that offer Aveda products. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of Cliniques Simple Hair Care System. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. 23 GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Net sales in the Americas increased 3% or $75.2 million to $2,953.4 million primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands as well as the success of new and recently launched products. Despite the increase, we continue to experience a soft retail environment in the United States. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 19% or $245.3 million to $1,506.4 million. Net sales in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland and Greece experienced double digit growth. Also contributing to the increase with double digit growth was our worldwide travel retail business, as sales recovered from the levels experienced after September 11, 2001. However, our travel retail business was adversely affected at the end of fiscal 2003 by certain world events including the lingering effects of the war in Iraq and concerns associated with SARS. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Europe, the Middle East & Africa net sales increased 8%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 8% or $47.2 million to $657.8 million primarily due to higher net sales in Korea, Japan, Australia and Thailand. Despite increased net sales in Japan, the country remains a difficult market due to local economic conditions and competition. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 3%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 26.1% from 26.8%, reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies and lower costs from promotional activities. We continued to emphasize sourcing initiatives and overall supply chain management which resulted in lower manufacturing costs, whereas in the prior year we experienced under absorption of overhead as a result of the impact of the events of September 11, 2001. The inclusion of promotional merchandise as a component of cost of sales results in lower margins. A strategic shift to reduce these activities has contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin for the year. The inclusion of the cost of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase merchandise as a component of cost of sales resulted from our adoption of EITF Issue No. 01 9. Since the cost of these promotional activities is a component of cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased to 64.2% of net sales as compared with 66.0% of net sales in the prior year period. The current year results were impacted by a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million or 0.4% of net sales. Prior year operating expenses included a restructuring charge of $110.4 million or 2.3% of net sales. Before considering the effect of these two charges, operating expenses increased slightly to 63.8% of net sales compared with 63.5% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in spending primarily related to advertising, sampling and merchandising activities particularly during the early portion of fiscal 2003 (excluding purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities, discussed as a component of cost of sales) which supported our sales growth and built momentum going into the second half of fiscal 2003. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. OPERATING RESULTS Operating income increased 45% or $153.7 million to $495.1 million as compared with the prior year period. Operating margins were 9.7% of net sales in the current period as compared with 7.2% in the prior year period. These results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million in the current year and a prior year restructuring charge of $117.4 million. Absent these items, operating income increased 13% or $58.3 million to $517.1 million and operating margins increased to 10.1% as compared with 9.7% in fiscal 2002. These increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth, including the benefits from favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar and gross margin improvement, as well as benefits from our prior restructurings and our continued cost containment efforts. 24 Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 67% and 80%, respectively. Net earnings improved $127.9 million to $319.8 million and net earnings per diluted share increased by $.56 from $.70 to $1.26. Absent the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2002, net earnings increased by $107.3 million or 50% and diluted earnings per common share increased 62% to $1.26 from $.78 in the prior year. Before the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring and the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle, net earnings increased 15% to $333.3 million and diluted earnings per common share increased 20% to $1.32 from $1.10 in the prior year. The following discussions of Operating Results by PRODUCT CATEGORIES and GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. The tables on page 21 reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statement of earnings. PRODUCT CATEGORIES Operating income more than doubled to $32.1 million in fragrance due primarily to improved results from our travel retail business. Operating income increased 10% to $273.2 million in skin care and 8% to $198.0 million in makeup reflecting higher net sales, partially offset by strategic spending on advertising, sampling and merchandising, particularly in the earlier portion of the current year. Operating income increased $1.1 million or 8% to $14.8 million in hair care, reflecting improvements in Aveda and Bumble and bumble, as well as higher profits in the latter portion of the year outside the United States. GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Operating income in the Americas increased 11% or $23.8 million to $246.7 million due to sales growth, the benefits of our prior restructurings and continued cost containment efforts. Operating income also benefited from the results of strategic efforts related to product support spending in the earlier part of the year that led to increased net sales during the year. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 27% or $47.8 million to $227.7 million primarily due to the improved operating results in the United Kingdom as well as increased results generated from our travel retail business. As described elsewhere, profitability in the region has been and will continue to be affected by current international uncertainties. In Asia/Pacific, operating income decreased 24% or $13.3 million to $42.7 million. This decrease reflects improved results in Korea and Thailand, which were more than offset by a decrease in Australia, which derived a benefit in the prior year period from a change in our retailer arrangements. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $8.1 million as compared with $9.8 million in the prior year. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower outstanding net borrowings and higher interest income generated by higher invested cash balances. This improvement was partially offset by a higher effective interest rate, which resulted from the increased proportion of fixed rate debt as compared with variable rate debt in the same period last year. In May 2003, we executed a fixed to floating interest rate swap on our $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes due 2012. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further details. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for the fiscal year was 33.0% as compared with 34.5% in the prior year period. These rates differ from statutory rates, reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The decrease in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives, including the favorable settlement of certain tax negotiations and the reduction of the overall tax rate relating to the Companys foreign operations. In addition, the tax effect of the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding in late fiscal 2003 contributed to an effective tax rate slightly lower than previously expected. 25 FISCAL 2002 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2001 NET SALES Net sales increased 2% or $76.0 million to $4.74 billion reflecting growth in the makeup, skin care and hair care categories, partially offset by a decline in fragrance net sales. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 3%. The unusual events that occurred during fiscal 2002 and their effect on the economy, particularly in the United States, adversely impacted our business. In addition, the decline in worldwide travel during most of fiscal 2002 led to a 13% reduction in our travel retail sales. Sales growth from certain newer brands and recently launched products partially offset these decreases. The following discussions of Net Sales by PRODUCT CATEGORIES and GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS exclude the impact of the restructurings in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. Neither restructuring was material to our net sales, and we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. For a discussion of the restructurings, see "Operating Expenses Restructuring and Special Charges" in this section. The tables on pages 21 and 22 reconcile these results to operating income as reporting in the consolidated statement of earnings. PRODUCT CATEGORIES SKIN CARE Net sales of skin care products increased 3% or $42.6 million to $1.70 billion. The net sales increase is primarily attributable to recently launched products such as Total Turnaround Visible Skin Renewer, Advanced Night Repair Eye Recovery Complex, Moisture Surge Extra Thirsty Skin Relief and Moisture Surge Eye Gel, A Perfect World line of products, LightSource Transforming Moisture Lotion and Cream, and Re Nutriv Ultimate Lifting Creme. Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Turnaround Cream and Resilience Lift, as well as products in Cliniques 3 Step Skin Care System. MAKEUP Makeup net sales increased 4% or $68.9 million to $1.79 billion. Newer brands such as M.A.C, Bobbi Brown and Stila, which are primarily makeup products, contributed through growth at existing doors and increased distribution. In addition, strong sales of the Pure Color Line of products, the worldwide launch of Gentle Light Makeup and Illusionist Mascara contributed positively to net sales growth. Partially offsetting the increase in net sales were lower sales of Two in One Eye Shadow, Lucidity Makeup, and Long Last Soft Shine Lipstick. FRAGRANCE Net sales of fragrance products decreased 6% or $67.8 million to $1.02 billion. This category was impacted by the softness of the fragrance business in the United States and the decline in our travel retail business, which depends substantially on fragrance products. Lower net sales of Beautiful, Estee Lauder pleasures, DKNY for Women and certain existing Tommy Hilfiger products were partially offset by the launch of T, a fragrance in the Tommy Hilfiger line, and Intuition for Men, as well as strong sales of Donna Karan Cashmere Mist. HAIR CARE Hair care net sales increased 19% or $35.1 million to $215.8 million. This increase was primarily the result of growth from Aveda, which benefited from the launch of texture lotion products and Color Conserve Shampoo and an increase in the number of Company owned Aveda Experience Centers. Sales of Bumble and bumble products increased due to an expanded product line and an increase in the number of points of sale. The results were partially offset by lower sales from Cliniques Simple Hair Care System when compared with the prior year launch. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. 26 GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Net sales in the Americas increased 1% or $20.4 million to $2.88 billion. The increase was primarily due to the success of most newer brands, partially offset by economic weakness and uncertainty in the United States during most of the fiscal year. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 3% or $39.3 million to $1.26 billion. This increase was primarily the result of higher net sales in the United Kingdom, Spain and Greece, where in fiscal 2002 we formed a joint venture, in which we own a controlling majority interest, with our former distributor. The increase was partially offset by lower net sales in our travel retail business, which has been adversely affected by a decrease in worldwide travel. Excluding the impact of our travel retail business, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 8% or $77.8 million. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 2% or $14.5 million to $610.6 million primarily due to higher net sales in Korea and Thailand, as well as in Australia where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements. The increased sales were partially offset by lower net sales in Japan. Japan continued to be a difficult market due to local economic conditions and increasing competition. The challenges were made more difficult by the weakness of the Japanese yen during fiscal 2002 as compared with the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 9%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 26.8% as compared with 26.3% in the prior year. The lower margin can be attributed in part to production volume decreases resulting in under absorption of overhead, as well as lower than planned raw material purchases that reduced anticipated savings from sourcing initiatives. Partially offsetting these negative factors were lower sales volumes of products with a higher cost of goods, particularly in travel retail and fragrance. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses increased to 66.0% of net sales as compared with 63.1% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses primarily related to restructuring expenses, continued advertising and promotional spending and the cost to expand and operate our retail stores. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects a slower growth rate in sales than operating expenses, primarily due to economic conditions in the United States as discussed above. As part of our long term strategies, we continued to emphasize the building of "brand equities" through advertising and promotional spending and retail store expansion despite difficult economic times. Changes in advertising and promotional spending result from the type, timing and level of advertising and promotional activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. Excluding the impact of restructuring and special charges, operating expenses were 63.5% and 61.9% of net sales for the fiscal years ended 2002 and 2001, respectively. RESTRUCTURING AND SPECIAL CHARGES During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded charges for a restructuring related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive long term growth and increase profitability. The restructuring focused on cost reduction opportunities related to the Internet, our supply chain, globalization of the organization and distribution channel refinements. We committed to a defined plan of action, which resulted in an aggregate pre tax charge of $117.4 million, of which $59.4 million is cash related. On an after tax basis, the aggregate charge was $76.9 million, equal to $.32 per diluted share. 27 Specifically, the charge included the following: o INTERNET. In an effort to achieve strategic objectives, reduce costs and improve profitability, we outsourced Gloss.com platform development and maintenance efforts to a third party provider. Additionally, Gloss.com closed its San Francisco facility and consolidated its operations in New York. As a result, included in the charge was a $23.9 million provision for restructuring the Gloss.com operations, including benefits and severance packages for 36 employees as well as asset write offs. We also took a $20.1 million charge to write off the related Gloss.com acquisition goodwill. o SUPPLY CHAIN. Building on previously announced supply chain initiatives, we restructured certain manufacturing, distribution, research and development, information systems and quality assurance operations in the United States, Canada and Europe, which included benefits and severance for 110 employees. A charge of $23.7 million was recorded related to this effort. o GLOBALIZATION OF ORGANIZATION. We continued to implement our transition, announced in 2001, to a global brand structure designed to streamline the decision making process and increase innovation and speed to market. The next phase of this transition entailed eliminating duplicate functions and responsibilities, which resulted in charges for benefits and severance for 122 employees. We recorded a charge of $27.1 million associated with these efforts. o DISTRIBUTION. We evaluated areas of distribution relative to our financial targets and decided to focus our resources on the most productive sales channels and markets. As a result, we closed our operations in Argentina and the remaining customers are being serviced by our Chilean affiliate. We began to close all remaining in store "tommys shops" and we identified for closing other select points of distribution. We recorded a $22.6 million provision related to these actions, which included benefits and severance for 85 employees. Following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2002: RESTRUCTURING NET COST OF OPERATING SALES SALES EXPENSES TOTAL (IN MILLIONS) Internet ............................ $ $ $ 44.0 $ 44.0 Supply Chain ........................ 23.7 23.7 Globalization of Organization ....... 27.1 27.1 Distribution ........................ 6.2 0.8 15.6 22.6 TOTAL CHARGE ........................ $ 6.2 $ 0.8 $110.4 117.4 Tax effect .......................... (40.5) NET CHARGE .......................... $ 76.9 The restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or, where applicable, as a reduction of the related asset. During fiscal 2002, $9.3 million related to this restructuring was paid. We expected to, and did, settle a majority of the remaining obligations by the end of fiscal 2003 with certain additional payments to be made ratably through fiscal 2006. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded charges for restructuring and special charges related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive long term growth and increase profitability. The restructuring and special charges focused on four areas: product fixtures for the jane brand; in store "tommy shops"; information systems and other assets; and global brand reorganization. We committed to a defined plan of action, which resulted in an aggregate pre tax charge of $63.0 million, of which $35.9 million is cash related. On an after tax basis, the aggregate charge was $40.3 million, equal to $.17 per diluted share. As of June 30, 2003, the remaining obligation was $2.6 million with payments expected to be made ratably through fiscal 2004. 28 OPERATING RESULTS Operating income decreased 31% or $154.2 million to $341.4 million as compared with the prior year. Operating margins were 7.2% of net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared with 10.6% in the prior year. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to restructuring expenses, lower than expected sales levels, increased support spending and new distribution channel costs. This was partially offset by the exclusion of amortization expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in fiscal 2002 and the November 2000 expiration of amortization related to purchased royalty rights. Operating income reflected the inclusion of restructuring and special charges of $117.4 million and $63.0 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Before consideration of the restructuring and special charges, operating income decreased 18% to $458.8 million and operating margins were 9.7% in fiscal 2002 as compared with 11.9% in fiscal 2001. Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately 37% and 39%, respectively. Net earnings declined $113.3 million to $191.9 million and net earnings per diluted share was lower by $.46 per diluted share from $1.16 to $.70. On a comparable basis, before restructuring and special charges, before the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle, and excluding goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001, net earnings were $289.4 million, representing a decrease of 20% over the prior year, and diluted earnings per common share decreased 21% to $1.10 from $1.39 in the prior year. The following discussions of Operating Results by PRODUCT CATEGORIES and GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS exclude the impact of restructuring and special charges. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. The tables on pages 21 and 22 reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statement of earnings. PRODUCT CATEGORIES Operating income decreased 79% to $13.4 million in fragrance, 14% to $183.2 million in makeup and 7% to $248.4 million in skin care, primarily due to lower than anticipated sales levels, coupled with continued advertising and promotional spending to promote new and recently launched products. Hair care operating income increased 5%, from a smaller base, to $13.7 million, primarily due to sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble. GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Operating income in the Americas decreased 26% or $77.0 million to $222.9 million, primarily due to lower sales attributable to weakness in the U.S. economy and continued advertising and promotional spending. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income decreased 11% or $21.9 million to $179.9 million, primarily due to the significant decrease in our travel retail business. Partially offsetting the decrease were improved operating results in Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany. We also benefited from the inclusion of operating results from our majority owned joint venture in Greece. In Asia/Pacific, operating income decreased slightly to $56.0 million due to lower income in China and Hong Kong offset by higher results in Korea, in Australia, where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements, and in Japan, where we were able to reduce operating expenses. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $9.8 million as compared with $12.3 million in the prior year. The decrease in net interest expense resulted from a lower effective interest rate compared with the prior year. This was primarily due to our interest rate risk management strategy that relied on commercial paper and variable rate term loans. In January 2002, we took advantage of prevailing market rates and issued fixed rate long term notes to replace our variable rate debt. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The Companys effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring and recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, state and local taxes, tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies. The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2002 was 34.5% compared with 36% in the prior year. These rates reflect the effect of state and local taxes, changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and certain non deductible expenses. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives, as well as a decrease in non deductible domestic royalty expense and the elimination of certain non deductible goodwill amortization resulting from the implementation of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." 29 FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of $364.1 million compared with $546.9 million at June 30, 2002. At June 30, 2003, our outstanding borrowings of $291.4 million included: (i) $257.1 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 consisting of $250.0 million principal, an unamortized debt discount of $1.0 million, and an $8.1 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap; (ii) a 3.0 billion yen term loan (approximately $25.2 million at current exchange rates), which is due in March 2006; (iii) $7.8 million of other short term borrowings; and (iv) $1.3 million of other long term borrowings. In May 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our outstanding $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on LIBOR. In the short term, this will provide us with a lower level of interest expense related to the 6% Senior Notes based on current variable interest rates, however, over the life of the notes, interest expense may be greater than 6% based upon the fluctuations of LIBOR. We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States. Our commercial paper is currently rated A 1 by Standard & Poors and P 1 by Moodys. Our long term credit ratings are A+ by Standard & Poors and A1 by Moodys. At June 30, 2003, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to $500.0 million in debt securities. As of June 30, 2003, we had an unused $400.0 million revolving credit facility, expiring on June 28, 2006, and $156.6 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities. Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary. From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding. To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility. The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate. We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis. CASH FLOWS Net cash provided by operating activities was $548.5 million in fiscal 2003 as compared with $518.0 million in fiscal 2002 and $305.4 million in fiscal 2001. The improved operating cash flow primarily reflects increased earnings and seasonal levels of operating assets and liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities reflect an improvement in accounts receivable collections, and a higher level of accounts payable, partially offset by increased inventories in anticipation of product launches in the first half of fiscal 2004 and the impact of acquisitions on required inventory levels. The improvement in net cash flows for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was generated primarily by a reduction of inventory. Inventory levels were unseasonably high at the end of fiscal 2001 and were lowered during fiscal 2002 as part of our effort to keep inventory levels in line with forecasted sales. Operating cash flows were generally not impacted by the fiscal 2002 restructuring as lower net earnings were offset by the non cash portion of the charge and the increase in other accrued liabilities. Net cash used for investing activities was $192.5 million in fiscal 2003, compared with $217.0 million in fiscal 2002 and $206.3 million in fiscal 2001. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 primarily relates to capital expenditures and the acquisition of Darphin and certain Aveda distributors. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 relates primarily to capital expenditures. 30 Capital expenditures amounted to $163.1 million, $203.2 million and $192.2 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Spending in all three years primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment, dies and molds, new store openings, store improvements, counter construction and information technology enhancements. The reduced level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 reflects tight control on our spending in light of economic conditions, fewer retail store openings and reduced spending related to leasehold improvements. Cash used for financing activities was $550.4 million, $121.8 million and $63.5 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The net cash used for financing activities in 2003 primarily relates to common stock repurchases, the repayment of long term debt and dividend payments. Net cash used for financing during fiscal 2002 primarily relates to dividend payments and common stock repurchases. The net cash used in fiscal 2001 was primarily related to dividend payments. DIVIDENDS The Board of Directors declared, and we paid on our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, an annual dividend of $.20 per share in fiscal 2003 and quarterly dividends at the rate of $.05 per share in each quarter of fiscal 2002 and 2001. The last quarterly dividend of $.05 per share was paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. As previously disclosed, the Board of Directors determined that, at its discretion, it would declare and the Company would pay dividends on its common stock annually rather than quarterly commencing in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, dividends declared on our common stock totaled $46.5 million, $47.5 million and $47.7 million, respectively. Total dividends declared, including dividends on the $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, were $69.9 million, $70.9 million and $71.1 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM In September 1998, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase a total of up to 8.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors. In October 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock, increasing the total authorization under the share repurchase program to 18.0 million shares. During fiscal 2003, we purchased 11.2 million shares for $352.4 million. As of June 30, 2003, we have purchased approximately 13.8 million shares under this program. Subsequent to year end, we purchased an additional 0.4 million shares for $12.3 million bringing the cumulative total of acquired shares to 14.2 million. PENSION PLAN FUNDING AND EXPENSE We maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our U.S. operations and a majority of our international operations. Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings. In the United States, we maintain a trust based, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan ("U.S. Plan"). Additionally, we have an unfunded, nonqualified domestic benefit plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations. Our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Several factors influence our annual funding requirements. For the U.S. Plan, our funding policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages. Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in "Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates"). The effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. During fiscal 2003, we changed certain of the underlying assumptions associated with our pension plans based upon the recent past performance and outlook of the securities markets, resulting in a larger funding requirement. In addition, the assets associated with the pension plans experienced negative investment returns, which also affected our funding requirements. Even after considering the impact of these factors, there was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Plan required by ERISA for fiscal 2003 and 2002. However, at managements discretion, we made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $76.0 million and $43.0 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. 31 In addition, at June 30, 2003, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a charge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we recorded a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $20.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively. This charge had no impact on our consolidated net earnings or liquidity. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We will be required to redeem the outstanding $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on June 30, 2005. However, in the event that Mrs. Estee Lauder were to pass away before such date, then we would have the right to redeem the shares from the current holders, and the holders of such shares would have the right to put the shares to us, at $100 per share (for an aggregate cost of $360.0 million). If shares of $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock are put to us, we would have up to 120 days after notice to purchase such shares. Certain of our business acquisition agreements include "earn out" provisions. These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business. The payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next "earn out" payment is expected to be made after the end of fiscal 2005. Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition. Under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales, royalty payments totaling $20.3 million, $16.5 million and $16.0 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, have been charged to expense. Such payments were made to Mrs. Estee Lauder. This obligation is not necessarily fixed and determinable, and therefore has been excluded from the following contractual obligation table. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2003. Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter (In millions) Long term debt including current portion (1) $ 291.4 $ 7.8 $ 1.3 $ 25.2 $ $ $ 257.1 Redeemable preferred stock (2) 360.0 360.0 Lease commitments (3) 605.6 120.1 104.6 74.4 61.9 54.8 189.8 Unconditional purchase obligations (4) 698.7 346.9 37.8 42.6 27.3 25.5 218.6 Total contractual obligations $1,955.7 $ 474.8 $ 503.7 $ 142.2 $ 89.2 $ 80.3 $ 665.5 (1) Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Includes operating lease commitments, and to a lesser extent, minimal capital lease commitments. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated future earn out payments, estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments and capital improvement commitments. In July 2003, we signed a new lease for our principal offices at the same location. Our rental obligations under the new lease will commence in fiscal 2005 and expire in fiscal 2020. Obligations pursuant to the lease in fiscal 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and thereafter are $5.9 million, $23.6 million, $23.6 million, $24.1 million and $324.2 million, respectively. 32 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS In April 2003, we acquired the Paris based Darphin group of companies that develops, manufactures and markets the "Darphin" brand of skin care products. The initial purchase price, paid at closing, was funded by cash provided by operations, and did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. An additional payment is expected to be made in fiscal 2009, the amount of which will depend on future net sales and earnings of the Darphin business. In May 2003, we entered into a license agreement to manufacture and sell fragrances and beauty products under the "Michael Kors" trademarks with Michael Kors L.L.C. At the same time, we purchased certain related rights and inventory from American Designer Fragrances, a division of LVMH. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates. We categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries. Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize. The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2003, these cash flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects. As a matter of policy, we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an "A" (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts. Management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results. The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2004. Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. At June 30, 2003, we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $476.7 million and $57.7 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($114.0 million), Swiss franc ($61.9 million), Japanese yen ($56.0 million), British pound ($49.8 million), Canadian dollar ($37.7 million), South Korean won ($37.6 million) and Australian dollar ($30.6 million). The foreign currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($21.9 million), Canadian dollar ($21.0 million) and Euro ($11.7 million). INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT We enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness, as well as cash investments, for periods consistent with the identified exposures. All interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. 33 In May 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on LIBOR. We designated the swap as a fair value hedge. As of June 30, 2003, the fair value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects. Additionally, in May 2003, we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all in rate of 4.53%. These treasury lock agreements expire in September 2003 and are used to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the anticipated issuance of debt. The agreements will be settled upon the issuance of the new debt, if completed, and any realized gain or loss to be received or paid by us will be amortized in interest expense over the life of the new debt. We designated the treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2003, the cash flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects. MARKET RISK We use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments. Value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250 day period. The measured value at risk, calculated as an average, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2003 related to our foreign exchange contracts was $7.6 million. As of June 30, 2003, the measured value at risk related to our interest rate contracts was $10.3 million. The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level. We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths. Our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 34 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS No. 150"). SFAS No. 150 established standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It specifically requires that mandatorily redeemable instruments, instruments with repurchase obligations which embody, are indexed to, or obligate the repurchase of, the issuers own equity shares, and instruments with obligations to issue a variable number of the issuers own equity shares, be classified as a liability. Initial and subsequent measurements of the instruments differ based on the characteristics of each instrument and as provided for in the statement. SFAS No. 150 is effective for all freestanding financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise became effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We have adopted this statement effective for all instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and will adopt the statement for any existing financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Based on the provisions of this statement, beginning in fiscal 2004, we will be classifying the $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as a liability and the related dividends thereon will be characterized as interest expense. Restatement of financial statements for earlier years presented is not permitted. The adoption of this statement will result in the inclusion of the dividends on the preferred stock (equal to $23.4 million per year) as interest expense. While the inclusion will impact net earnings, net earnings attributable to common stock and earnings per common share will be unaffected. Given that the dividends are not deductible for income tax purposes, the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends as an interest expense will cause an increase in our effective tax rate. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have no impact on our financial condition. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS No. 148"). SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally defined by SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." Additionally, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transitional requirements of SFAS No. 148 are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted the disclosure portion of this statement for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. The application of the disclosure portion of this standard has no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The FASB recently indicated that it will require stock based employee compensation to be recorded as a charge to earnings pursuant to a standard on which it is currently deliberating. The FASB anticipates issuing an Exposure Draft in the fourth quarter of 2003 and a final statement in the second quarter of 2004. We will continue to monitor the FASBs progress on the issuance of this standard as well as evaluate our position with respect to current guidance. 35 FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders. The words and phrases "will likely result," "expect," "believe," "planned," "will," "will continue," "may," "could," "anticipated," "estimate," "project" or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale and future operations or operating results. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: (1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have greater resources than we do; (2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend; (3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors and ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers; (4) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for the types of products and services we sell; (5) social, political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic manufacturing, distribution and retail operations, including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the United States; (6) changes in the laws, regulations and policies that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings; (7) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States; (8) changes in global or local economic conditions that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness of consumers to travel, the financial strength of our customers, the cost and availability of capital, which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates; (9) shipment delays, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities which, due to consolidations in our manufacturing operations, now manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e. focus factories); (10) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities; (11) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable; (12) our ability to acquire or develop e commerce capabilities, and other new information and distribution technologies, on a timely basis and within our cost estimates; (13) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as globalization, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom; and (14) consequences attributable to the events that are currently taking place in Iraq and that took place in New York City and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, including further attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation. We assume no responsibility to update forward looking statements made herein or otherwise. 36 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
