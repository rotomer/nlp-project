Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recently Issued Accounting Standards). Additionally, in connection with this pronouncement, redeemable preferred stock has been reclassified as a component of total debt subsequent to June 30, 2003. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 did not provide for retroactive restatement of historical financial data. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition; concentration of credit risk; inventory; pension and other postretirement benefit costs; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; and derivatives. Revenue Recognition Generally, revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer. We report our sales levels on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns. As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested, authorized and approved. In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollar for dollar basis. Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales. This accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual returns by region and product category. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated events. As a percentage of gross sales, sales returns were 4.6%, 5.1% and 4.8% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 17 Concentration of Credit Risk An entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers. The significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration. We have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for $1,253.8 million, or 22%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2004 and $166.6 million, or 25%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2004. These customers sell products primarily within North America. Although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of $30.1 million and $31.8 million as of June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings. The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $25.6 million, $30.3 million and $24.8 million for customer deductions and write offs in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and increased by $23.9 million, $31.5 million and $28.6 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends. Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale. The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead. We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value, based on various product sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales. In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust based noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan); an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations; a contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation; and certain other postretirement benefits. The amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables. Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels. We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings. The pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds. For fiscal 2004, we used a pre retirement discount rate for our U.S. Plan of 5.75% and varying rates on our international plans of between 2.25% and 6.00%. For fiscal 2004, we used an expected return on plan assets of 8.00% for our U.S. Plan and varying rates of between 3.25% and 7.50% for our international plans. In determining the long term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies. The U.S. Plan asset allocation as of June 30, 2004 was approximately 63% equity investments, 32% fixed income investments, and 5% other investments. For fiscal 2005, we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the U.S. Plan of 6.00% and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 7.75%. The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2004 will cause a de minimis decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2005. We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets. Other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized. 18 On an annual basis, we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. To determine the fair value of these intangible assets, there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing. We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose. To mitigate undue influence, we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding years. It requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. As of June 30, 2004, we have current net deferred tax assets of $145.9 million and non current net deferred tax liabilities of $26.8 million. The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately $4.2 million for deferred tax assets, which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date, where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction. Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required. If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time. Furthermore, we provide tax reserves for Federal, state and international exposures relating to audit results, planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities. The development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. Derivatives We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This Statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value. We currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments. Variables that are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof. 19 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories. The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2 and Note 18 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category. In February 2004, we sold the assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold jane brand products. Prior to the sale of the business, in December 2003, we committed to a plan to sell such assets and operations. At the time the decision was made, circumstances warranted that we conduct an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of the jane business. Based on our assessment, we determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on our consolidated balance sheet exceeded their estimated fair value. In accordance with the assessment and the closing of the sale, we recorded an after tax charge to discontinued operations of $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The charge represents the impairment of goodwill in the amount of $26.4 million; the reduction in value of other tangible assets in the amount of $2.1 million, net of taxes; and the reporting units operating loss of $4.8 million, net of tax. Included in the operating loss of the fiscal year were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business. All consolidated statements of earnings information for the prior years presented have been restated for comparative purposes, including the restatement of the makeup product category and the Americas region data.

We have presented these reconciliations because of the special nature of the charges or the fact that they are not necessarily comparable from period to period. We believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations. This is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods. There were no events or transactions in fiscal 2004 for which we believe such a presentation would be relevant. While we consider the non GAAP financial measures useful in analyzing our results, it is not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Fiscal 2003 The table below reconciles the fiscal 2003 results as reported and results prior to adjustment for a special pre tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share, in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants. The amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year and we do not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future. 21 Year Ended June 30, 2003 (In millions, except per share data ) Results As Reported Reconciling Items Non GAAP Results Net sales $ 5,096.0 $ $ 5,096.0 Cost of sales 1,324.4 1,324.4 Gross profit 3,771.6 3,771.6 Gross margin 74.0 % 74.0 % Operating expenses 3,267.9 22.0 3,245.9 Operating expense margin 64.1 % 63.7 % Operating income 503.7 22.0 525.7 Operating income margin 9.9 % 10.3 % Provision (benefit) for income taxes 163.3 (8.5 ) 171.8 Net earnings from continuing operations 325.6 13.5 339.1 Discontinued operations, net of tax (5.8 ) (5.8 ) Net earnings $ 319.8 $ 13.5 $ 333.3 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ 296.4 $ 13.5 $ 309.9 Diluted net earnings per common share: Net earnings attributable to common stock from continuing operations $ 1.29 $ .06 $ 1.35 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ 1.26 $ .06 $ 1.32 Fiscal 2002 The table below reconciles the fiscal 2002 results as reported and results prior to adjustment for pre tax restructuring charges of $117.4 million (of which $0.8 million was included in discontinued operations), or $76.9 million after tax (of which $0.5 million was included in discontinued operations), equal to $.32 per diluted common share. The restructuring charges were related to repositioning certain businesses as part of a globalization and reorganization initiative and are described in greater detail in Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The restructuring was not considered part of our core continuing business in fiscal 2002. Management also excludes the related charge in evaluating its performance when comparing fiscal 2002 to future periods. Year Ended June 30, 2002 (In millions, except per share data) Results As Reported Reconciling Items Non GAAP Results Net sales $ 4,711.5 $ 6.2 $ 4,717.7 Cost of sales 1,260.5 0.8 1,259.7 Gross profit 3,451.0 7.0 3,458.0 Gross margin 73.2 % 73.3 % Operating expenses 3,108.9 109.6 2,999.3 Operating expense margin 66.0 % 63.6 % Operating income 342.1 116.6 458.7 Operating income margin 7.2 % 9.7 % Provision (benefit) for income taxes 114.7 (40.2 ) 154.9 Net earnings from continuing operations 212.9 76.4 289.3 Discontinued operations, net of tax (21.0 ) 0.5 (20.5 ) Net earnings $ 191.9 $ 76.9 $ 268.8 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ 168.5 $ 76.9 $ 245.4 Diluted net earnings per common share: Net earnings attributable to common stock from continuing operations $ .79 $ .31 $ 1.10 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ .70 $ .32 $ 1.02 22 Fiscal 2004 as Compared with Fiscal 2003 NET SALES Net sales increased 14% or $694.4 million to $5,790.4 million, reflecting growth in all product categories and all geographic regions led by double digit growth in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net sales results in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 9%. Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 13% or $246.4 million to $2,140.1 million. This increase was primarily attributable to the recent launches of Hydra Complete Multi Level Moisture Cream and Idealist Micro D Deep Thermal Refinisher by Este Lauder and Pore Minimizer by Clinique. Additionally, the increase was supported by strong sales of Cliniques 3 Step Skin Care System and the Repairwear line of products from Clinique as well as Re Nutriv Intensive Lift Serum and Re Nutriv Intensive Eye Crme by Este Lauder. Also contributing to this increase was the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which are primarily skin care, and growth in developing brands. Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Advanced Stop Signs by Clinique and White Light and Lightsource product lines by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 8%. Makeup Makeup net sales increased 14% or $260.5 million to $2,148.3 million, in part, due to strong sales of our MAC and Bobbi Brown makeup artist lines. The increase in net sales also reflected the current year launches of Ideal Matte Refinishing Makeup SPF 8 and Electric Intense LipCreme by Este Lauder and Perfectly Real Makeup and Colour Surge Bare Brilliance by Clinique. Also contributing to net sales growth were strong sales of High Impact Mascara, High Impact Eye Shadow and Skin Clarifying Makeup by Clinique, as well as Pure Color Lip Vinyl and Artists Lip and Eye Pencils from Este Lauder. Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as So Ingenious Multi Dimension Liquid Makeup and Pure Color Lipstick from Este Lauder and Moisture Surge Lipstick from Clinique. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 10%. Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 15% or $161.5 million to $1,221.1 million, primarily attributable to the current year launches of Este Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life, Clinique Simply and the Tommy Jeans collection. These product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the United States. Additionally, the increase in net sales benefited from improved results from our travel retail business. These net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of Este Lauder pleasures, Intuition and Beautiful, certain Tommy Hilfiger products and Clinique Happy. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 10%. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 9% or $20.5 million to $249.4 million. This increase was primarily the result of sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas, new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products. Aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new Company owned Aveda Experience Centers. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of Cliniques Simple Hair Care System. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 7%. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $217.0 million to $3,148.8 million, primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands, the success of new and recently launched products and increases from most of the Companys freestanding retail stores, all of which reflected the strengthening retail environment. Nevertheless, the prestige fragrance business in the United States continues to be challenging. 23 In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 24% or $363.8 million to $1,870.2 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece and South Africa, as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products. We also benefited from the effect of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 14%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 17% or $113.6 million to $771.4 million, primarily due to higher net sales in Japan, Australia, Taiwan, China and Thailand. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 9%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 25.5% from 26.0% reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately 70 basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately 60 basis points. Partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately 40 basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and re handling of goods of approximately 20 basis points. Also offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail sales, which contributed approximately 10 basis points. Travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure. Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased to 63.4% of net sales as compared with 64.1% of net sales in the prior year. Prior year operating expenses included a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million or 0.4% of net sales. Before considering the effect of this charge, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points from 63.7% in the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales, particularly in the travel retail business, as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs, partially offset by operating expenses related to BeautyBank, the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements (such as those arising under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002). Partially offsetting the net favorability in the current year were higher levels of advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately 70 basis points. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. Under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales, royalty payments totaling $18.8 million and $20.3 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been charged to expense. Such payments were made to Mrs. Este Lauder until her death on April 24, 2004, after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust. This event resulted in a reduction of operating expenses in fiscal 2004 of $3.7 million, or $2.2 million after tax. We will realize a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal 2005. OPERATING RESULTS Operating income increased 28% or $140.3 million to $644.0 million. Operating margins were 11.1% of net sales in the current period as compared with 9.9% in the prior year. Prior year results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million. Absent this charge, operating income increased 23% or $118.3 million and operating margins increased 80 basis points from fiscal 2003. These increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth, improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. 24 Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 7% and 17%, respectively. Net earnings improved $22.3 million to $342.1 million and net earnings per diluted share increased by 17% from $1.26 to $1.48. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $49.8 million or 15% and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 26% to $1.62 from $1.29 in the prior year. Absent the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding, net earnings from continuing operations increased by $36.3 million or 11% and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 21% from $1.35. The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. The table on page 22 reconciles these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings. Product Categories Operating income increased 23% to $336.3 million in skin care, 25% to $257.7 million in makeup and 59% to $23.6 million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product launches. Operating income decreased 23% to $24.8 million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category in the United States as well as increased support spending related to new product launch activities. Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas increased 25% or $63.9 million to $319.2 million due to sales growth resulting from an improved retail environment, strong product launches and growth from newer brands. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 21% or $46.7 million to $274.4 million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel retail business, improved operating results in the United Kingdom and Spain as well as the addition of a full year of results of the Darphin line of products. Partially offsetting these increases were lower results in Switzerland and Italy due to difficult market conditions. In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 18% or $7.7 million to $50.4 million. This increase reflects improved results in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand, partially offset by lower results in Korea. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $27.1 million as compared with $8.1 million in the prior year. The increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of $17.4 million as interest expense in fiscal 2004. This change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibits us from restating the prior fiscal year results (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards). To a lesser extent, interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio. In fiscal 2005, we expect a reduction in interest expense as a result of the partial redemption of preferred stock and the lower dividend rate on the remaining preferred stock compared to fiscal 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2004 was 37.7% as compared with 32.9% in the prior year. These rates differ from statutory rates, reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense, which are not deductible for income tax purposes, the mix of global earnings and, to a lesser extent, the timing of certain tax planning initiatives. The prior year rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations. Fiscal 2003 as Compared with Fiscal 2002 NET SALES Net sales increased 8% or $384.5 million to $5,096.0 million, reflecting growth in all product categories and each of our geographic regions. Product category results were led by skin care, and our regions were led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa, where results benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates to the U.S. dollar and improvements in the travel retail business. Travel retail improved during the middle of fiscal 2003 compared with lower results during the middle of fiscal 2002 but was adversely affected during the last quarter of fiscal 2003 by certain world events, including the lingering effects of the war in Iraq and concerns relating to SARS. Such events may affect our future sales and earnings. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 4%. 25 Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 11% or $190.4 million to $1,893.7 million, which was primarily attributable to the recent launches of Perfectionist Correcting Serum for Lines/Wrinkles and Resilience Lift OverNight Face and Throat Crme by Este Lauder, and the Repairwear line of products and Advanced Stop Signs from Clinique. Additionally, the increase was supported by strong sales of Comforting Cream Cleanser, Moisture Surge Extra Thirsty Skin Relief and Moisture Surge Eye Gel, and products in the 3 Step Skin Care System by Clinique, as well as by Re Nutriv Ultimate Lifting Creme from Este Lauder, and A Perfect World line of products by Origins. Partially offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Stop Signs, Total Turnaround Cream and Turnaround Cream by Clinique and Idealist Skin Refinisher by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%. Makeup Makeup net sales increased 7% or $129.5 million to $1,887.8 million due to strong sales of our makeup artist lines and fiscal 2003 launches of Dewy Smooth Anti Aging Makeup and Colour Surge Lipstick by Clinique, and MagnaScopic Maximum Volume Mascara and Artists Lip and Eye Pencils from Este Lauder. Also contributing to growth were strong sales from Este Lauder brand products including So Ingenious Multi Dimension Liquid Makeup and Loose Powder, as well as from new and existing products in the Pure Color line. Offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Sumptuous Lipstick from Este Lauder, and Gentle Light Makeup and Powder and High Impact Eye Shadow Duos by Clinique. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 4%. Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 4% or $42.3 million to $1,059.6 million, primarily reflecting the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. The fragrance industry continues to experience a difficult environment. The travel retail business, which depends substantially on fragrance products, began to improve in the middle of the fiscal year relative to the prior year, however the latter part of fiscal 2003 was adversely affected by international uncertainties stemming from events in Iraq and concerns relating to SARS. In fiscal 2003, we successfully launched Este Lauder pleasures intense, T girl by Tommy Hilfiger, Clinique Happy Heart, Lauder Intuition for Men and Donna Karan Black Cashmere. Net sales also benefited from strong sales of Beautiful by Este Lauder and Aromatics Elixir from Clinique. Offsetting these increases and sales from new product launches were lower net sales of certain Tommy Hilfiger products, Intuition by Este Lauder and Este Lauder pleasures. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales were relatively unchanged from the prior year. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 6% or $13.1 million to $228.9 million. This increase was primarily the result of sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products. We also increased the number of Company owned Aveda Experience Centers and strategically decreased the number of salons that offer Aveda products. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of Cliniques Simple Hair Care System. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 3% or $85.8 million to $2,931.8 million primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands as well as the success of newly launched products. Despite the increase, we continued to experience a soft retail environment in the United States in fiscal 2003. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 19% or $245.3 million to $1,506.4 million. Net sales in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland and Greece experienced double digit growth. Also contributing to the increase with double digit growth was our worldwide travel retail business, as sales recovered from the levels experienced after September 11, 2001. However, our travel retail business was adversely affected at the end of fiscal 2003 by certain world events including the lingering effects of the war in Iraq and concerns associated with SARS. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Europe, the Middle East & Africa net sales increased 8%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 8% or $47.2 million to $657.8 million primarily due to higher net sales in Korea, Japan, Australia and Thailand. Despite increased net sales in Japan, the country remained a difficult market due to local economic conditions and competition. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 3%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. 26 COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 26.0% from 26.8%, reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies and lower costs from promotional activities. We continued to emphasize sourcing initiatives and overall supply chain management which resulted in lower manufacturing costs, whereas in the prior year we experienced under absorption of overhead as a result of the impact of the events of September 11, 2001. The inclusion of promotional merchandise as a component of cost of sales results in lower margins. A strategic shift to reduce these activities in fiscal 2003 contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin for the year. The inclusion of the cost of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase merchandise as a component of cost of sales resulted from our adoption of EITF Issue No. 01 9. Since the cost of these promotional activities is a component of cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased to 64.1% of net sales as compared with 66.0% of net sales in the prior year period. The fiscal 2003 results were impacted by a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million or 0.4% of net sales. Fiscal 2002 operating expenses included a restructuring charge of $109.6 million or 2.3% of net sales. Before considering the effect of these two charges, operating expenses increased slightly to 63.7% of net sales compared with 63.6% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in spending primarily related to advertising, sampling and merchandising activities particularly during the early portion of fiscal 2003 (excluding purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities, discussed as a component of cost of sales) which supported our sales growth and built momentum going into the second half of fiscal 2003. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. OPERATING RESULTS Operating income increased 47% or $161.6 million to $503.7 million as compared with the prior year period. Operating margins were 9.9% of net sales in fiscal 2003 as compared with 7.2% in fiscal 2002. These results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million in the current year and a prior year restructuring charge of $116.6 million. Absent these items, operating income increased 15% or $67.0 million to $525.7 million and operating margins increased to 10.3% as compared with 9.7% in fiscal 2002. These increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth, including the benefits from favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar and gross margin improvement, as well as benefits from our prior restructurings and our continued cost containment efforts. Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 67% and 80%, respectively. Net earnings improved $127.9 million to $319.8 million and net earnings per diluted share increased by $.56 from $.70 to $1.26. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $112.7 million or 53% and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 63% to $1.29 from $.79 in the prior year. Before the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring, net earnings from continuing operations increased 17% to $339.1 million and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 23% to $1.35 from $1.10 in the prior year. The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. The tables on page 22 reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings. Product Categories Operating income more than doubled to $32.1 million in fragrance due primarily to improved results from our travel retail business. Operating income increased 10% to $273.2 million in skin care and 13% to $206.6 million in makeup reflecting higher net sales, partially offset by strategic spending on advertising, sampling and merchandising, particularly in the earlier portion of fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $1.1 million or 8% to $14.8 million in hair care, reflecting improvements in Aveda and Bumble and bumble, as well as higher profits in the latter portion of the year outside the United States. 27 Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas increased 15% or $32.5 million to $255.3 million due to sales growth, the benefits of our prior restructurings and continued cost containment efforts. Operating income also benefited from the results of strategic efforts related to product support spending in the earlier part of the year that led to increased net sales during the year. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 27% or $47.8 million to $227.7 million primarily due to the improved operating results in the United Kingdom as well as increased results generated from our travel retail business. As described elsewhere, profitability in the region has been and will continue to be affected by international uncertainties. In Asia/Pacific, operating income decreased 24% or $13.3 million to $42.7 million. This decrease reflects improved results in Korea and Thailand, which were more than offset by a decrease in Australia, which derived a benefit in the prior year period from a change in our retailer arrangements. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $8.1 million as compared with $9.8 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower outstanding net borrowings and higher interest income generated by higher invested cash balances. This improvement was partially offset by a higher effective interest rate, which resulted from the increased proportion of fixed rate debt as compared with variable rate debt in the prior year. In May 2003, we executed a fixed to floating interest rate swap on our $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes due 2012. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2003 was 32.9% as compared with 34.5% in fiscal 2002. These rates differ from statutory rates, reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The decrease in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives, including the favorable settlement of certain tax negotiations and the reduction of the overall tax rate relating to the Companys foreign operations. In addition, the tax effect of the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding in late fiscal 2003 contributed to an effective tax rate slightly lower than previously expected. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of $611.6 million compared with $364.1 million at June 30, 2003. At June 30, 2004, our outstanding borrowings of $535.3 million included: (i) $236.6 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 consisting of $250.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.9 million and a $12.5 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap; (ii) $197.3 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.7 million; (iii) $68.4 million of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which shares have a mandatory redemption date of June 30, 2015 (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards); (iv) a 3.0 billion yen term loan (approximately $27.6 million at exchange rates as of June 30, 2004), which is due in March 2006; and (v) $5.4 million of other short term borrowings. In September 2003, we issued and sold $200.0 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 (5.75% Senior Notes) in a public offering. The 5.75% Senior Notes were priced at 98.645% with a yield of 5.846%. Interest payments, which commenced April 15, 2004, will be made semi annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. In May 2003, in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes, we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all in rate of 4.53%. The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and we received a payment of $15.0 million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the 5.75% Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, our effective interest rate on the 5.75% Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life of the debt. We issued these fixed rate notes to lock in long term liquidity at historically low prevailing market rates and to mitigate future interest rate volatility. 28 On December 31, 2003, we and the holders of the $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock exchanged all of the outstanding shares of $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock due June 30, 2005 for a newly issued series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a mandatory redemption date of June 30, 2015 (2015 Preferred Stock). For the quarters ended December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004, the dividend rate on the 2015 Preferred Stock was 4.75% per annum, payable quarterly. On April 24, 2004, Mrs. Este Lauder passed away. As a result, our right to call for redemption $291.6 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock became exercisable and the holders right to put to us all $360.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock became exercisable. On June 10, 2004, we redeemed, for cash, all $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock that could be redeemed at that time. Upon this partial redemption, the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock was reduced, for the period from April 25, 2004 through June 30, 2004, from 4.75% per annum to 0.62% per annum, which is a rate based on the after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. So long as the remaining shares of 2015 Preferred Stock are outstanding, the dividend rate will be reset semi annually in January and July at the then existing after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. The dividend rate for the six month period from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 is 0.994%. As a result of the redemption of the $291.6 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock and the reduction of the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock, we expect to save, net of financing costs, approximately $14.0 million in fiscal 2005. The remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock may be put to us at any time at face value, but may not be redeemed by us until May 24, 2005. If put to us on or before June 30, 2005, we would have up to 120 days after the exercise date of the put to pay for the shares. If the remaining shares of 2015 Preferred Stock are put to us or if we call those shares for redemption, we expect to use cash on hand to fund the redemption. We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States. Our commercial paper is currently rated A 1 by Standard & Poors and P 1 by Moodys. Our long term credit ratings are A+ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poors and A1 with a stable outlook by Moodys. At June 30, 2004, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional $300.0 million in debt securities. As of June 30, 2004, we had an unused $400.0 million revolving credit facility, expiring on June 28, 2006, and $173.3 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities, of which $5.4 million was used. Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary. From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding. To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 24% at June 30, 2004 as compared with 14% at June 30, 2003. This increase primarily reflects the classification of the 2015 Preferred Stock as short term debt as well as the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes in fiscal 2004. The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate. We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis. 29 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $669.8 million in fiscal 2004 as compared with $553.1 million in fiscal 2003 and $519.3 million in fiscal 2002. The improved operating cash flow primarily reflects increased net earnings from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs. Changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in anticipation of product launches in fiscal 2005, higher accounts receivable in line with sales growth, and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit related transactions as well as selling, advertising and merchandising activities. We expect cash flows from operations in fiscal 2005 to reflect payments of approximately $47 million, net of tax, related to deferred compensation and supplemental pension arrangements. The improvement in net cash flows for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 reflected increased earnings and seasonal levels of operating assets and liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities reflected an improvement in accounts receivable collections in fiscal 2003, and a higher level of accounts payable, partially offset by increased inventories at June 30, 2003 in anticipation of product launches in the first half of fiscal 2004 and the impact of acquisitions on required inventory levels. Net cash used for investing activities was $208.0 million in fiscal 2004, compared with $192.5 million in fiscal 2003 and $217.0 million in fiscal 2002. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to capital expenditures and the acquisition of Darphin and certain Aveda distributors. Net cash used in fiscal 2002 related primarily to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures amounted to $206.5 million, $163.1 million and $203.2 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Spending in all three years primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment, dies and molds, new store openings, store improvements, counter construction and information technology enhancements. In fiscal 2005, we expect our capital expenditures to increase as a result of a company wide initiative to upgrade our financial systems as well as our plan to invest in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices. The reduced level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 reflected tight control on our spending in light of then prevailing economic conditions, fewer retail store openings and reduced spending related to leasehold improvements. Cash used for financing activities was $216.0 million, $555.0 million and $123.1 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock, common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes and employee stock transactions. Net cash used for financing during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 primarily related to common stock repurchases, the repayment of long term debt and dividend payments. Dividends On November 5, 2003, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.30 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on January 6, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 16, 2003. Common stock dividends paid during the fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $68.5 million, $58.3 million and $47.6 million, respectively. Dividends paid on the preferred stock were $17.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2004 and $23.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. The decrease reflects an agreement to reduce the dividend of the preferred stock made in connection with the exchange of the preferred shares on December 31, 2003 and the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock on June 10, 2004. The dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock was reduced, for the period from April 25, 2004 through June 30, 2004, from 4.75% per annum to 0.62% per annum, which is a rate based on the after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. The dividend rate for the six month period July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 is 0.994%. So long as the remaining shares of 2015 Preferred Stock are outstanding, the dividend rate will be reset semi annually in January and July at the then existing after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. The cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends declared for the year ended June 30, 2004 have been characterized as interest expense (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards). Pension Plan Funding and Expense We maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our U.S. operations and a majority of our international operations. Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings. In the United States, we maintain a trust based, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan). Additionally, we have an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations. Our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. 30 Several factors influence our annual funding requirements. For the U.S. Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages. Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates). The effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. For fiscal 2004 and 2003 there was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Plan required by ERISA. However, at managements discretion, we made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $33.0 million and $76.0 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depending upon market conditions during fiscal 2005, we expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. Plan of $16.0 million. In addition, at June 30, 2004 and 2003, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. During fiscal 2004, we recorded a benefit, net of deferred tax, of $16.0 million, while in fiscal 2003, we recorded a charge, net of deferred tax, of $20.3 million to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Commitments and Contingencies On June 10, 2004, we redeemed all $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock that could be redeemed at that time. The remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock may be put to us at any time at face value, but may not be redeemed by us until May 24, 2005. If shares of the 2015 Preferred Stock are put to us on or before June 30, 2005, we would have up to 120 days after notice to purchase such shares. Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions. These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business. The payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment is expected to be made after the end of fiscal 2005. Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2004. Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter (In millions) Long term debt including current portion (1) $ 535.3 $ 73.8 $ 27.6 $ $ $ $ 433.9 Lease commitments (2) 1,001.9 132.8 122.5 108.9 92.6 80.9 464.2 Unconditional purchase obligations (3) 873.7 372.8 115.0 77.4 76.4 42.7 189.4 Deferred compensation (4) 16.1 16.1 Total contractual obligations $ 2,427.0 $ 595.5 $ 265.1 $ 186.3 $ 169.0 $ 123.6 $ 1,087.5 (1) Refer to Notes 8 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Includes operating lease commitments, and to a lesser extent, minimal capital lease commitments. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated future earn out payments, estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments and capital improvement commitments. (4) Share units that were recorded as a component of Stockholders Equity as of June 30, 2004 have been converted to the cash equivalent value and placed in a deferred compensation account in fiscal 2005 based on a decision of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in August 2004. 31 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates. We categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries. Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize. The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2004, these cash flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects. As a matter of policy, we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts. Management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results. The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2005. Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. At June 30, 2004, we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $593.6 million and $82.0 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($122.6 million), Swiss franc ($117.1 million), British pound ($72.8 million), Japanese yen ($66.7 million), South Korean won ($42.0 million), Canadian dollar ($41.7 million), and Australian dollar ($33.7 million). The foreign currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($34.1 million), British pound ($25.4 million), and Swiss franc ($12.7 million). Interest Rate Risk Management We enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness, as well as cash investments, for periods consistent with the identified exposures. All interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six month LIBOR. We designated the swap as a fair value hedge. As of June 30, 2004, the fair value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects. Additionally, in May 2003, in connection with the anticipated issuance of debt, we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all in rate of 4.53%. These treasury lock agreements were used to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the September 2003 issuance of debt. The agreements were settled upon the issuance of the $200.0 million of 5.75% Senior Notes and we realized a gain in other comprehensive income of $15.0 million that is currently being amortized against interest expense over the 30 year life of the 5.75% Senior Notes. 32 Market Risk We use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments. Value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250 day period. The measured value at risk, calculated as an average, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2004 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was $9.5 million and $14.5 million, respectively. The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level. We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths. Our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS On May 19, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP No. 106 2), in response to a new law regarding prescription drug benefits under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a Federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Currently, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106), requires that changes in relevant law be considered in current measurement of postretirement benefit costs. FSP No. 106 2 will be effective for financial statements of companies for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. We will adopt FSP No. 106 2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and will recognize the impact of the new law under Medicare Part D, which will not be material to our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. Therefore, any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the net periodic postretirement benefit cost as of and for the year ended June 30, 2004 do not reflect the effects of the new law. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 46 R (FIN 46 R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 R, which modifies certain provisions and effective dates of FIN 46, sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity should be consolidated. These provisions are based on the general premise that if a company controls another entity through interests other than voting interests, that company should consolidate the controlled entity. We have evaluated whether the provisions of FIN 46 R are applicable to our investments, certain of which are currently accounted for by the equity method, as well as other arrangements, which may meet the criteria of the interpretation, and believe that there are currently no material arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity which would require consolidation. In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 132 (Revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and other Postretirement Benefits (SFAS No. 132 (R)), establishing additional annual disclosures about plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations and cash flows. In addition, the revised standard established interim disclosure requirements related to the net periodic benefit cost recognized and contributions paid or expected to be paid during the current fiscal year. The new annual disclosures are effective for financial statements of companies with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003 and the interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. We adopted the interim disclosures for our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004 and the annual disclosures for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. The adoption of the revised SFAS No. 132 (R) had no impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 33 We have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS No. 150). SFAS No. 150 established standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Among other things, it specifically requires that mandatorily redeemable instruments, such as redeemable preferred stock, be classified as a liability. Initial and subsequent measurements of the instruments differ based on the characteristics of each instrument and as provided for in the statement. Based on the provisions of this statement, we have classified the cumulative redeemable preferred stock as a liability and the related dividends thereon have been characterized as interest expense. Restatement of financial statements for earlier years presented was not permitted. The adoption of this statement has resulted in the inclusion of the dividends on the preferred stock (equal to $17.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2004) as interest expense. While the inclusion has impacted net earnings, net earnings attributable to common stock and earnings per common share were unaffected. Given that the dividends are not deductible for income tax purposes, the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends as an interest expense has caused an increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 had no impact on our financial condition. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders. The words and phrases will likely result, expect, believe, planned, will, will continue, may, could, anticipated, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale and future operations or operating results. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: (1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have greater resources than we do; (2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend; (3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors and ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers; (4) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for the types of products and services we sell; (5) social, political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic manufacturing, distribution and retail operations, including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the United States; (6) changes in the laws, regulations and policies that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings; (7) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States; (8) changes in global or local economic conditions that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness of consumers to travel, the financial strength of our customers, the cost and availability of capital, which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates; (9) shipment delays, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities which, due to consolidations in our manufacturing operations, now manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e., focus factories); (10) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities; 34 (11) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable; (12) our ability to acquire or develop new information and distribution technologies, on a timely basis and within our cost estimates; (13) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as globalization, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom; and (14) consequences attributable to the events that are currently taking place in the Middle East, including further attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation. We assume no responsibility to update forward looking statements made herein or otherwise. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is set forth in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risk and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition; concentration of credit risk; inventory; pension and other postretirement benefit costs; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; and derivatives. Revenue Recognition Generally, revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer. We report our sales levels on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns. As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested, authorized and approved. In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollar for dollar basis. Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales. This accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual returns by region and product category. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated events. As a percentage of gross sales, sales returns were 4.6%, 5.1% and 4.8% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 17 Concentration of Credit Risk An entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers. The significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration. We have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for $1,253.8 million, or 22%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2004 and $166.6 million, or 25%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2004. These customers sell products primarily within North America. Although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of $30.1 million and $31.8 million as of June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings. The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $25.6 million, $30.3 million and $24.8 million for customer deductions and write offs in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and increased by $23.9 million, $31.5 million and $28.6 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends. Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale. The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead. We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value, based on various product sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales. In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust based noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan); an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations; a contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation; and certain other postretirement benefits. The amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables. Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels. We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings. The pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds. For fiscal 2004, we used a pre retirement discount rate for our U.S. Plan of 5.75% and varying rates on our international plans of between 2.25% and 6.00%. For fiscal 2004, we used an expected return on plan assets of 8.00% for our U.S. Plan and varying rates of between 3.25% and 7.50% for our international plans. In determining the long term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies. The U.S. Plan asset allocation as of June 30, 2004 was approximately 63% equity investments, 32% fixed income investments, and 5% other investments. For fiscal 2005, we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the U.S. Plan of 6.00% and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 7.75%. The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2004 will cause a de minimis decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2005. We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets. Other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized. 18 On an annual basis, we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. To determine the fair value of these intangible assets, there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing. We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose. To mitigate undue influence, we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding years. It requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. As of June 30, 2004, we have current net deferred tax assets of $145.9 million and non current net deferred tax liabilities of $26.8 million. The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately $4.2 million for deferred tax assets, which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date, where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction. Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required. If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time. Furthermore, we provide tax reserves for Federal, state and international exposures relating to audit results, planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities. The development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. Derivatives We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This Statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value. We currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments. Variables that are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof. 19 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories. The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2 and Note 18 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category. In February 2004, we sold the assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold jane brand products. Prior to the sale of the business, in December 2003, we committed to a plan to sell such assets and operations. At the time the decision was made, circumstances warranted that we conduct an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of the jane business. Based on our assessment, we determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on our consolidated balance sheet exceeded their estimated fair value. In accordance with the assessment and the closing of the sale, we recorded an after tax charge to discontinued operations of $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The charge represents the impairment of goodwill in the amount of $26.4 million; the reduction in value of other tangible assets in the amount of $2.1 million, net of taxes; and the reporting units operating loss of $4.8 million, net of tax. Included in the operating loss of the fiscal year were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business. All consolidated statements of earnings information for the prior years presented have been restated for comparative purposes, including the restatement of the makeup product category and the Americas region data.

We have presented these reconciliations because of the special nature of the charges or the fact that they are not necessarily comparable from period to period. We believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations. This is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods. There were no events or transactions in fiscal 2004 for which we believe such a presentation would be relevant. While we consider the non GAAP financial measures useful in analyzing our results, it is not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Fiscal 2003 The table below reconciles the fiscal 2003 results as reported and results prior to adjustment for a special pre tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share, in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants. The amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year and we do not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future. 21 Year Ended June 30, 2003 (In millions, except per share data ) Results As Reported Reconciling Items Non GAAP Results Net sales $ 5,096.0 $ $ 5,096.0 Cost of sales 1,324.4 1,324.4 Gross profit 3,771.6 3,771.6 Gross margin 74.0 % 74.0 % Operating expenses 3,267.9 22.0 3,245.9 Operating expense margin 64.1 % 63.7 % Operating income 503.7 22.0 525.7 Operating income margin 9.9 % 10.3 % Provision (benefit) for income taxes 163.3 (8.5 ) 171.8 Net earnings from continuing operations 325.6 13.5 339.1 Discontinued operations, net of tax (5.8 ) (5.8 ) Net earnings $ 319.8 $ 13.5 $ 333.3 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ 296.4 $ 13.5 $ 309.9 Diluted net earnings per common share: Net earnings attributable to common stock from continuing operations $ 1.29 $ .06 $ 1.35 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ 1.26 $ .06 $ 1.32 Fiscal 2002 The table below reconciles the fiscal 2002 results as reported and results prior to adjustment for pre tax restructuring charges of $117.4 million (of which $0.8 million was included in discontinued operations), or $76.9 million after tax (of which $0.5 million was included in discontinued operations), equal to $.32 per diluted common share. The restructuring charges were related to repositioning certain businesses as part of a globalization and reorganization initiative and are described in greater detail in Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The restructuring was not considered part of our core continuing business in fiscal 2002. Management also excludes the related charge in evaluating its performance when comparing fiscal 2002 to future periods. Year Ended June 30, 2002 (In millions, except per share data) Results As Reported Reconciling Items Non GAAP Results Net sales $ 4,711.5 $ 6.2 $ 4,717.7 Cost of sales 1,260.5 0.8 1,259.7 Gross profit 3,451.0 7.0 3,458.0 Gross margin 73.2 % 73.3 % Operating expenses 3,108.9 109.6 2,999.3 Operating expense margin 66.0 % 63.6 % Operating income 342.1 116.6 458.7 Operating income margin 7.2 % 9.7 % Provision (benefit) for income taxes 114.7 (40.2 ) 154.9 Net earnings from continuing operations 212.9 76.4 289.3 Discontinued operations, net of tax (21.0 ) 0.5 (20.5 ) Net earnings $ 191.9 $ 76.9 $ 268.8 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ 168.5 $ 76.9 $ 245.4 Diluted net earnings per common share: Net earnings attributable to common stock from continuing operations $ .79 $ .31 $ 1.10 Net earnings attributable to common stock $ .70 $ .32 $ 1.02 22 Fiscal 2004 as Compared with Fiscal 2003 NET SALES Net sales increased 14% or $694.4 million to $5,790.4 million, reflecting growth in all product categories and all geographic regions led by double digit growth in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net sales results in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 9%. Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 13% or $246.4 million to $2,140.1 million. This increase was primarily attributable to the recent launches of Hydra Complete Multi Level Moisture Cream and Idealist Micro D Deep Thermal Refinisher by Este Lauder and Pore Minimizer by Clinique. Additionally, the increase was supported by strong sales of Cliniques 3 Step Skin Care System and the Repairwear line of products from Clinique as well as Re Nutriv Intensive Lift Serum and Re Nutriv Intensive Eye Crme by Este Lauder. Also contributing to this increase was the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which are primarily skin care, and growth in developing brands. Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Advanced Stop Signs by Clinique and White Light and Lightsource product lines by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 8%. Makeup Makeup net sales increased 14% or $260.5 million to $2,148.3 million, in part, due to strong sales of our MAC and Bobbi Brown makeup artist lines. The increase in net sales also reflected the current year launches of Ideal Matte Refinishing Makeup SPF 8 and Electric Intense LipCreme by Este Lauder and Perfectly Real Makeup and Colour Surge Bare Brilliance by Clinique. Also contributing to net sales growth were strong sales of High Impact Mascara, High Impact Eye Shadow and Skin Clarifying Makeup by Clinique, as well as Pure Color Lip Vinyl and Artists Lip and Eye Pencils from Este Lauder. Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as So Ingenious Multi Dimension Liquid Makeup and Pure Color Lipstick from Este Lauder and Moisture Surge Lipstick from Clinique. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 10%. Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 15% or $161.5 million to $1,221.1 million, primarily attributable to the current year launches of Este Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life, Clinique Simply and the Tommy Jeans collection. These product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the United States. Additionally, the increase in net sales benefited from improved results from our travel retail business. These net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of Este Lauder pleasures, Intuition and Beautiful, certain Tommy Hilfiger products and Clinique Happy. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 10%. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 9% or $20.5 million to $249.4 million. This increase was primarily the result of sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas, new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products. Aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new Company owned Aveda Experience Centers. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of Cliniques Simple Hair Care System. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 7%. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $217.0 million to $3,148.8 million, primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands, the success of new and recently launched products and increases from most of the Companys freestanding retail stores, all of which reflected the strengthening retail environment. Nevertheless, the prestige fragrance business in the United States continues to be challenging. 23 In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 24% or $363.8 million to $1,870.2 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece and South Africa, as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products. We also benefited from the effect of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 14%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 17% or $113.6 million to $771.4 million, primarily due to higher net sales in Japan, Australia, Taiwan, China and Thailand. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 9%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 25.5% from 26.0% reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately 70 basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately 60 basis points. Partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately 40 basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and re handling of goods of approximately 20 basis points. Also offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail sales, which contributed approximately 10 basis points. Travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure. Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased to 63.4% of net sales as compared with 64.1% of net sales in the prior year. Prior year operating expenses included a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million or 0.4% of net sales. Before considering the effect of this charge, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points from 63.7% in the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales, particularly in the travel retail business, as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs, partially offset by operating expenses related to BeautyBank, the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements (such as those arising under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002). Partially offsetting the net favorability in the current year were higher levels of advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately 70 basis points. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. Under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales, royalty payments totaling $18.8 million and $20.3 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been charged to expense. Such payments were made to Mrs. Este Lauder until her death on April 24, 2004, after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust. This event resulted in a reduction of operating expenses in fiscal 2004 of $3.7 million, or $2.2 million after tax. We will realize a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal 2005. OPERATING RESULTS Operating income increased 28% or $140.3 million to $644.0 million. Operating margins were 11.1% of net sales in the current period as compared with 9.9% in the prior year. Prior year results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million. Absent this charge, operating income increased 23% or $118.3 million and operating margins increased 80 basis points from fiscal 2003. These increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth, improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. 24 Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 7% and 17%, respectively. Net earnings improved $22.3 million to $342.1 million and net earnings per diluted share increased by 17% from $1.26 to $1.48. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $49.8 million or 15% and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 26% to $1.62 from $1.29 in the prior year. Absent the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding, net earnings from continuing operations increased by $36.3 million or 11% and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 21% from $1.35. The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. The table on page 22 reconciles these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings. Product Categories Operating income increased 23% to $336.3 million in skin care, 25% to $257.7 million in makeup and 59% to $23.6 million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product launches. Operating income decreased 23% to $24.8 million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category in the United States as well as increased support spending related to new product launch activities. Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas increased 25% or $63.9 million to $319.2 million due to sales growth resulting from an improved retail environment, strong product launches and growth from newer brands. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 21% or $46.7 million to $274.4 million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel retail business, improved operating results in the United Kingdom and Spain as well as the addition of a full year of results of the Darphin line of products. Partially offsetting these increases were lower results in Switzerland and Italy due to difficult market conditions. In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 18% or $7.7 million to $50.4 million. This increase reflects improved results in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand, partially offset by lower results in Korea. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $27.1 million as compared with $8.1 million in the prior year. The increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of $17.4 million as interest expense in fiscal 2004. This change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibits us from restating the prior fiscal year results (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards). To a lesser extent, interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio. In fiscal 2005, we expect a reduction in interest expense as a result of the partial redemption of preferred stock and the lower dividend rate on the remaining preferred stock compared to fiscal 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2004 was 37.7% as compared with 32.9% in the prior year. These rates differ from statutory rates, reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense, which are not deductible for income tax purposes, the mix of global earnings and, to a lesser extent, the timing of certain tax planning initiatives. The prior year rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations. Fiscal 2003 as Compared with Fiscal 2002 NET SALES Net sales increased 8% or $384.5 million to $5,096.0 million, reflecting growth in all product categories and each of our geographic regions. Product category results were led by skin care, and our regions were led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa, where results benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates to the U.S. dollar and improvements in the travel retail business. Travel retail improved during the middle of fiscal 2003 compared with lower results during the middle of fiscal 2002 but was adversely affected during the last quarter of fiscal 2003 by certain world events, including the lingering effects of the war in Iraq and concerns relating to SARS. Such events may affect our future sales and earnings. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 4%. 25 Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 11% or $190.4 million to $1,893.7 million, which was primarily attributable to the recent launches of Perfectionist Correcting Serum for Lines/Wrinkles and Resilience Lift OverNight Face and Throat Crme by Este Lauder, and the Repairwear line of products and Advanced Stop Signs from Clinique. Additionally, the increase was supported by strong sales of Comforting Cream Cleanser, Moisture Surge Extra Thirsty Skin Relief and Moisture Surge Eye Gel, and products in the 3 Step Skin Care System by Clinique, as well as by Re Nutriv Ultimate Lifting Creme from Este Lauder, and A Perfect World line of products by Origins. Partially offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Stop Signs, Total Turnaround Cream and Turnaround Cream by Clinique and Idealist Skin Refinisher by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%. Makeup Makeup net sales increased 7% or $129.5 million to $1,887.8 million due to strong sales of our makeup artist lines and fiscal 2003 launches of Dewy Smooth Anti Aging Makeup and Colour Surge Lipstick by Clinique, and MagnaScopic Maximum Volume Mascara and Artists Lip and Eye Pencils from Este Lauder. Also contributing to growth were strong sales from Este Lauder brand products including So Ingenious Multi Dimension Liquid Makeup and Loose Powder, as well as from new and existing products in the Pure Color line. Offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as Sumptuous Lipstick from Este Lauder, and Gentle Light Makeup and Powder and High Impact Eye Shadow Duos by Clinique. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 4%. Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 4% or $42.3 million to $1,059.6 million, primarily reflecting the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. The fragrance industry continues to experience a difficult environment. The travel retail business, which depends substantially on fragrance products, began to improve in the middle of the fiscal year relative to the prior year, however the latter part of fiscal 2003 was adversely affected by international uncertainties stemming from events in Iraq and concerns relating to SARS. In fiscal 2003, we successfully launched Este Lauder pleasures intense, T girl by Tommy Hilfiger, Clinique Happy Heart, Lauder Intuition for Men and Donna Karan Black Cashmere. Net sales also benefited from strong sales of Beautiful by Este Lauder and Aromatics Elixir from Clinique. Offsetting these increases and sales from new product launches were lower net sales of certain Tommy Hilfiger products, Intuition by Este Lauder and Este Lauder pleasures. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales were relatively unchanged from the prior year. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 6% or $13.1 million to $228.9 million. This increase was primarily the result of sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products. We also increased the number of Company owned Aveda Experience Centers and strategically decreased the number of salons that offer Aveda products. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of Cliniques Simple Hair Care System. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 3% or $85.8 million to $2,931.8 million primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands as well as the success of newly launched products. Despite the increase, we continued to experience a soft retail environment in the United States in fiscal 2003. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 19% or $245.3 million to $1,506.4 million. Net sales in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland and Greece experienced double digit growth. Also contributing to the increase with double digit growth was our worldwide travel retail business, as sales recovered from the levels experienced after September 11, 2001. However, our travel retail business was adversely affected at the end of fiscal 2003 by certain world events including the lingering effects of the war in Iraq and concerns associated with SARS. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Europe, the Middle East & Africa net sales increased 8%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 8% or $47.2 million to $657.8 million primarily due to higher net sales in Korea, Japan, Australia and Thailand. Despite increased net sales in Japan, the country remained a difficult market due to local economic conditions and competition. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 3%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. 26 COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 26.0% from 26.8%, reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies and lower costs from promotional activities. We continued to emphasize sourcing initiatives and overall supply chain management which resulted in lower manufacturing costs, whereas in the prior year we experienced under absorption of overhead as a result of the impact of the events of September 11, 2001. The inclusion of promotional merchandise as a component of cost of sales results in lower margins. A strategic shift to reduce these activities in fiscal 2003 contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin for the year. The inclusion of the cost of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase merchandise as a component of cost of sales resulted from our adoption of EITF Issue No. 01 9. Since the cost of these promotional activities is a component of cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased to 64.1% of net sales as compared with 66.0% of net sales in the prior year period. The fiscal 2003 results were impacted by a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million or 0.4% of net sales. Fiscal 2002 operating expenses included a restructuring charge of $109.6 million or 2.3% of net sales. Before considering the effect of these two charges, operating expenses increased slightly to 63.7% of net sales compared with 63.6% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in spending primarily related to advertising, sampling and merchandising activities particularly during the early portion of fiscal 2003 (excluding purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities, discussed as a component of cost of sales) which supported our sales growth and built momentum going into the second half of fiscal 2003. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. OPERATING RESULTS Operating income increased 47% or $161.6 million to $503.7 million as compared with the prior year period. Operating margins were 9.9% of net sales in fiscal 2003 as compared with 7.2% in fiscal 2002. These results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of $22.0 million in the current year and a prior year restructuring charge of $116.6 million. Absent these items, operating income increased 15% or $67.0 million to $525.7 million and operating margins increased to 10.3% as compared with 9.7% in fiscal 2002. These increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth, including the benefits from favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar and gross margin improvement, as well as benefits from our prior restructurings and our continued cost containment efforts. Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 67% and 80%, respectively. Net earnings improved $127.9 million to $319.8 million and net earnings per diluted share increased by $.56 from $.70 to $1.26. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $112.7 million or 53% and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 63% to $1.29 from $.79 in the prior year. Before the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring, net earnings from continuing operations increased 17% to $339.1 million and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 23% to $1.35 from $1.10 in the prior year. The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. The tables on page 22 reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings. Product Categories Operating income more than doubled to $32.1 million in fragrance due primarily to improved results from our travel retail business. Operating income increased 10% to $273.2 million in skin care and 13% to $206.6 million in makeup reflecting higher net sales, partially offset by strategic spending on advertising, sampling and merchandising, particularly in the earlier portion of fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $1.1 million or 8% to $14.8 million in hair care, reflecting improvements in Aveda and Bumble and bumble, as well as higher profits in the latter portion of the year outside the United States. 27 Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas increased 15% or $32.5 million to $255.3 million due to sales growth, the benefits of our prior restructurings and continued cost containment efforts. Operating income also benefited from the results of strategic efforts related to product support spending in the earlier part of the year that led to increased net sales during the year. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 27% or $47.8 million to $227.7 million primarily due to the improved operating results in the United Kingdom as well as increased results generated from our travel retail business. As described elsewhere, profitability in the region has been and will continue to be affected by international uncertainties. In Asia/Pacific, operating income decreased 24% or $13.3 million to $42.7 million. This decrease reflects improved results in Korea and Thailand, which were more than offset by a decrease in Australia, which derived a benefit in the prior year period from a change in our retailer arrangements. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $8.1 million as compared with $9.8 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower outstanding net borrowings and higher interest income generated by higher invested cash balances. This improvement was partially offset by a higher effective interest rate, which resulted from the increased proportion of fixed rate debt as compared with variable rate debt in the prior year. In May 2003, we executed a fixed to floating interest rate swap on our $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes due 2012. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2003 was 32.9% as compared with 34.5% in fiscal 2002. These rates differ from statutory rates, reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The decrease in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives, including the favorable settlement of certain tax negotiations and the reduction of the overall tax rate relating to the Companys foreign operations. In addition, the tax effect of the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding in late fiscal 2003 contributed to an effective tax rate slightly lower than previously expected. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of $611.6 million compared with $364.1 million at June 30, 2003. At June 30, 2004, our outstanding borrowings of $535.3 million included: (i) $236.6 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 consisting of $250.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.9 million and a $12.5 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap; (ii) $197.3 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.7 million; (iii) $68.4 million of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which shares have a mandatory redemption date of June 30, 2015 (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards); (iv) a 3.0 billion yen term loan (approximately $27.6 million at exchange rates as of June 30, 2004), which is due in March 2006; and (v) $5.4 million of other short term borrowings. In September 2003, we issued and sold $200.0 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 (5.75% Senior Notes) in a public offering. The 5.75% Senior Notes were priced at 98.645% with a yield of 5.846%. Interest payments, which commenced April 15, 2004, will be made semi annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. In May 2003, in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes, we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all in rate of 4.53%. The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and we received a payment of $15.0 million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the 5.75% Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, our effective interest rate on the 5.75% Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life of the debt. We issued these fixed rate notes to lock in long term liquidity at historically low prevailing market rates and to mitigate future interest rate volatility. 28 On December 31, 2003, we and the holders of the $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock exchanged all of the outstanding shares of $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock due June 30, 2005 for a newly issued series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a mandatory redemption date of June 30, 2015 (2015 Preferred Stock). For the quarters ended December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004, the dividend rate on the 2015 Preferred Stock was 4.75% per annum, payable quarterly. On April 24, 2004, Mrs. Este Lauder passed away. As a result, our right to call for redemption $291.6 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock became exercisable and the holders right to put to us all $360.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock became exercisable. On June 10, 2004, we redeemed, for cash, all $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock that could be redeemed at that time. Upon this partial redemption, the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock was reduced, for the period from April 25, 2004 through June 30, 2004, from 4.75% per annum to 0.62% per annum, which is a rate based on the after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. So long as the remaining shares of 2015 Preferred Stock are outstanding, the dividend rate will be reset semi annually in January and July at the then existing after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. The dividend rate for the six month period from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 is 0.994%. As a result of the redemption of the $291.6 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock and the reduction of the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock, we expect to save, net of financing costs, approximately $14.0 million in fiscal 2005. The remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock may be put to us at any time at face value, but may not be redeemed by us until May 24, 2005. If put to us on or before June 30, 2005, we would have up to 120 days after the exercise date of the put to pay for the shares. If the remaining shares of 2015 Preferred Stock are put to us or if we call those shares for redemption, we expect to use cash on hand to fund the redemption. We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States. Our commercial paper is currently rated A 1 by Standard & Poors and P 1 by Moodys. Our long term credit ratings are A+ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poors and A1 with a stable outlook by Moodys. At June 30, 2004, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional $300.0 million in debt securities. As of June 30, 2004, we had an unused $400.0 million revolving credit facility, expiring on June 28, 2006, and $173.3 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities, of which $5.4 million was used. Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary. From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding. To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 24% at June 30, 2004 as compared with 14% at June 30, 2003. This increase primarily reflects the classification of the 2015 Preferred Stock as short term debt as well as the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes in fiscal 2004. The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate. We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis. 29 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $669.8 million in fiscal 2004 as compared with $553.1 million in fiscal 2003 and $519.3 million in fiscal 2002. The improved operating cash flow primarily reflects increased net earnings from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs. Changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in anticipation of product launches in fiscal 2005, higher accounts receivable in line with sales growth, and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit related transactions as well as selling, advertising and merchandising activities. We expect cash flows from operations in fiscal 2005 to reflect payments of approximately $47 million, net of tax, related to deferred compensation and supplemental pension arrangements. The improvement in net cash flows for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 reflected increased earnings and seasonal levels of operating assets and liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities reflected an improvement in accounts receivable collections in fiscal 2003, and a higher level of accounts payable, partially offset by increased inventories at June 30, 2003 in anticipation of product launches in the first half of fiscal 2004 and the impact of acquisitions on required inventory levels. Net cash used for investing activities was $208.0 million in fiscal 2004, compared with $192.5 million in fiscal 2003 and $217.0 million in fiscal 2002. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to capital expenditures and the acquisition of Darphin and certain Aveda distributors. Net cash used in fiscal 2002 related primarily to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures amounted to $206.5 million, $163.1 million and $203.2 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Spending in all three years primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment, dies and molds, new store openings, store improvements, counter construction and information technology enhancements. In fiscal 2005, we expect our capital expenditures to increase as a result of a company wide initiative to upgrade our financial systems as well as our plan to invest in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices. The reduced level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 reflected tight control on our spending in light of then prevailing economic conditions, fewer retail store openings and reduced spending related to leasehold improvements. Cash used for financing activities was $216.0 million, $555.0 million and $123.1 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock, common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes and employee stock transactions. Net cash used for financing during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 primarily related to common stock repurchases, the repayment of long term debt and dividend payments. Dividends On November 5, 2003, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.30 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on January 6, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 16, 2003. Common stock dividends paid during the fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $68.5 million, $58.3 million and $47.6 million, respectively. Dividends paid on the preferred stock were $17.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2004 and $23.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. The decrease reflects an agreement to reduce the dividend of the preferred stock made in connection with the exchange of the preferred shares on December 31, 2003 and the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock on June 10, 2004. The dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock was reduced, for the period from April 25, 2004 through June 30, 2004, from 4.75% per annum to 0.62% per annum, which is a rate based on the after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. The dividend rate for the six month period July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 is 0.994%. So long as the remaining shares of 2015 Preferred Stock are outstanding, the dividend rate will be reset semi annually in January and July at the then existing after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries. The cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends declared for the year ended June 30, 2004 have been characterized as interest expense (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards). Pension Plan Funding and Expense We maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our U.S. operations and a majority of our international operations. Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings. In the United States, we maintain a trust based, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan). Additionally, we have an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations. Our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. 30 Several factors influence our annual funding requirements. For the U.S. Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages. Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates). The effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. For fiscal 2004 and 2003 there was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Plan required by ERISA. However, at managements discretion, we made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $33.0 million and $76.0 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depending upon market conditions during fiscal 2005, we expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. Plan of $16.0 million. In addition, at June 30, 2004 and 2003, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. During fiscal 2004, we recorded a benefit, net of deferred tax, of $16.0 million, while in fiscal 2003, we recorded a charge, net of deferred tax, of $20.3 million to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Commitments and Contingencies On June 10, 2004, we redeemed all $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock that could be redeemed at that time. The remaining $68.4 million principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock may be put to us at any time at face value, but may not be redeemed by us until May 24, 2005. If shares of the 2015 Preferred Stock are put to us on or before June 30, 2005, we would have up to 120 days after notice to purchase such shares. Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions. These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business. The payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment is expected to be made after the end of fiscal 2005. Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2004. Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter (In millions) Long term debt including current portion (1) $ 535.3 $ 73.8 $ 27.6 $ $ $ $ 433.9 Lease commitments (2) 1,001.9 132.8 122.5 108.9 92.6 80.9 464.2 Unconditional purchase obligations (3) 873.7 372.8 115.0 77.4 76.4 42.7 189.4 Deferred compensation (4) 16.1 16.1 Total contractual obligations $ 2,427.0 $ 595.5 $ 265.1 $ 186.3 $ 169.0 $ 123.6 $ 1,087.5 (1) Refer to Notes 8 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates. We categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries. Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize. The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2004, these cash flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects. As a matter of policy, we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts. Management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results. The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2005. Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. At June 30, 2004, we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $593.6 million and $82.0 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($122.6 million), Swiss franc ($117.1 million), British pound ($72.8 million), Japanese yen ($66.7 million), South Korean won ($42.0 million), Canadian dollar ($41.7 million), and Australian dollar ($33.7 million). The foreign currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($34.1 million), British pound ($25.4 million), and Swiss franc ($12.7 million). Interest Rate Risk Management We enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness, as well as cash investments, for periods consistent with the identified exposures. All interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six month LIBOR. We designated the swap as a fair value hedge. As of June 30, 2004, the fair value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects. Additionally, in May 2003, in connection with the anticipated issuance of debt, we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all in rate of 4.53%. These treasury lock agreements were used to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the September 2003 issuance of debt. The agreements were settled upon the issuance of the $200.0 million of 5.75% Senior Notes and we realized a gain in other comprehensive income of $15.0 million that is currently being amortized against interest expense over the 30 year life of the 5.75% Senior Notes. 32 Market Risk We use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments. Value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250 day period. The measured value at risk, calculated as an average, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2004 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was $9.5 million and $14.5 million, respectively. The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level. We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths. Our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS On May 19, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP No. 106 2), in response to a new law regarding prescription drug benefits under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a Federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Currently, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106), requires that changes in relevant law be considered in current measurement of postretirement benefit costs. FSP No. 106 2 will be effective for financial statements of companies for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. We will adopt FSP No. 106 2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and will recognize the impact of the new law under Medicare Part D, which will not be material to our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. Therefore, any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the net periodic postretirement benefit cost as of and for the year ended June 30, 2004 do not reflect the effects of the new law. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 46 R (FIN 46 R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 R, which modifies certain provisions and effective dates of FIN 46, sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity should be consolidated. These provisions are based on the general premise that if a company controls another entity through interests other than voting interests, that company should consolidate the controlled entity. We have evaluated whether the provisions of FIN 46 R are applicable to our investments, certain of which are currently accounted for by the equity method, as well as other arrangements, which may meet the criteria of the interpretation, and believe that there are currently no material arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity which would require consolidation. In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 132 (Revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and other Postretirement Benefits (SFAS No. 132 (R)), establishing additional annual disclosures about plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations and cash flows. In addition, the revised standard established interim disclosure requirements related to the net periodic benefit cost recognized and contributions paid or expected to be paid during the current fiscal year. The new annual disclosures are effective for financial statements of companies with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003 and the interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. We adopted the interim disclosures for our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004 and the annual disclosures for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. The adoption of the revised SFAS No. 132 (R) had no impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 33 We have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS No. 150). SFAS No. 150 established standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Among other things, it specifically requires that mandatorily redeemable instruments, such as redeemable preferred stock, be classified as a liability. Initial and subsequent measurements of the instruments differ based on the characteristics of each instrument and as provided for in the statement. Based on the provisions of this statement, we have classified the cumulative redeemable preferred stock as a liability and the related dividends thereon have been characterized as interest expense. Restatement of financial statements for earlier years presented was not permitted. The adoption of this statement has resulted in the inclusion of the dividends on the preferred stock (equal to $17.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2004) as interest expense. While the inclusion has impacted net earnings, net earnings attributable to common stock and earnings per common share were unaffected. Given that the dividends are not deductible for income tax purposes, the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends as an interest expense has caused an increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 had no impact on our financial condition. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders. The words and phrases will likely result, expect, believe, planned, will, will continue, may, could, anticipated, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale and future operations or operating results. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: (1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have greater resources than we do; (2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend; (3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors and ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers; (4) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for the types of products and services we sell; (5) social, political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic manufacturing, distribution and retail operations, including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the United States; (6) changes in the laws, regulations and policies that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings; (7) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States; (8) changes in global or local economic conditions that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness of consumers to travel, the financial strength of our customers, the cost and availability of capital, which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates; (9) shipment delays, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities which, due to consolidations in our manufacturing operations, now manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e., focus factories); (10) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities; 34 (11) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable; (12) our ability to acquire or develop new information and distribution technologies, on a timely basis and within our cost estimates; (13) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as globalization, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom; and (14) consequences attributable to the events that are currently taking place in the Middle East, including further attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation. We assume no responsibility to update forward looking statements made herein or otherwise. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
