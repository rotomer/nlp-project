Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2005 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition; concentration of credit risk; inventory; pension and other postretirement benefit costs; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; and derivatives. Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. 19 Revenue Recognition Revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods. In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and, in the Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customers receipt. In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale (e.g., at our retail stores). Sales are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns. Our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved. In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer. As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 4.7%, 4.6% and 5.1% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales. This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels. Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations. Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the solvency of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products. Concentration of Credit Risk An entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers. The significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration. We have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for $1,403.1 million, or 22%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2005 and $187.9 million, or 24%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2005. These customers sell products primarily within North America. Our two largest customers, Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company, merged on August 30, 2005. Although management believes that our major customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of $28.9 million and $30.1 million as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings. The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $12.6 million, $25.6 million and $30.3 million for customer deductions and write offs in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and increased by $11.4 million, $23.9 million and $31.5 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends. Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale. The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead. We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value, based on various product sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales. In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Qualified Plan) and an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans); a contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation; and certain other postretirement benefits. 20 The amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables. Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels. We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings. The pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds. For fiscal 2005, we used a pre retirement discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 6.00% and varying rates on our international plans of between 2.25% and 6.00%. The pre retirement rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans. For fiscal 2005, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 3.25% and 7.50% for our international plans. In determining the long term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies. The U.S. Qualified Plan asset allocation as of June 30, 2005 was approximately 67% equity investments, 26% fixed income investments and 7% other investments. The asset allocation of our combined international plans as of June 30, 2005 was approximately 62% equity investments, 32% fixed income investments and 6% other investments. The difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods. For fiscal 2005, our pension plans had actual returns on assets of $43.2 million as compared with expected returns on assets of $35.3 million, which resulted in a net deferred gain of $7.9 million. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2005 pension expense: (In millions) 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease Discount rate $ (2.3 ) $ 2.3 Expected return on assets $ (1.3 ) $ 1.3 Our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2005 would have had the following effects: (In millions) One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest costs $ 1.1 $ (1.0 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligations $ 10.1 $ (9.1 ) For fiscal 2006, we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the Domestic Plans of 5.25% and varying rates for our international plans of between 1.75% and 5.25%. We anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.75% and 7.50%. The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2005 will cause approximately a $6.5 million increase in pension expense in fiscal 2006. We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. Other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized. On an annual basis, or sooner if certain events or circumstances warrant, we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. To determine the fair value of these intangible assets, there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing. We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose. To mitigate undue influence, we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding years. It requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. 21 As of June 30, 2005, we have current net deferred tax assets of $85.3 million and non current net deferred tax liabilities of $68.1 million. The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately $5.1 million for deferred tax assets, which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date, where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction. Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required. If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time. We provide tax reserves for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to audit results, tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities. The development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. Although the outcome of these tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities emanating from these reviews. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our results of operations. Derivatives We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value. We currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments. Variables that are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof. For a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risk. Quantitative Analysis During the three year period ended June 30, 2005, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates, since the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations. While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes. For fiscal 2005, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.5 million, operating expenses would have changed by approximately $0.7 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.8 million. The collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.2 million, $6.0 million and $0.03, respectively. 22 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories. The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2 and Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category. In February 2004, we sold the assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold jane brand products. Based on an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of this business, we determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on our consolidated balance sheets exceeded their estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an after tax charge to discontinued operations of $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The charge represented the impairment of goodwill in the amount of $26.4 million, the reduction in value of other tangible assets of $2.1 million, net of tax, and the operating loss of $4.8 million, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. Included in that operating loss were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business. All consolidated statement of earnings information for fiscal 2003 has been restated for comparative purposes, including restatement of the makeup product category and the Americas region data.

The economics of developing, producing and launching these new products influence our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Net Sales Net sales increased 9% or $545.9 million to $6,336.3 million reflecting growth in all major product categories, led by makeup and skin care, and growth in all geographic regions, led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 7%. Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 10% or $212.0 million to $2,352.1 million. Approximately $179 million of this sales increase was related to the introduction of Future Perfect Anti Wrinkle Radiance Creme SPF 15 and launches in the Perfectionist and Re Nutriv product lines by Este Lauder, launches of Superdefense Triple Action Moisturizers SPF 25 and certain Repairwear products by Clinique, the introduction of certain American Beauty and Good Skin products and the recent launch of Modern Friction by Origins. On a combined basis, strong sales of products in Cliniques 3 Step Skin Care System and The Lifting Face Serum & The Lifting Intensifier by La Mer contributed approximately $29 million to the sales increase. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $52 million in sales of Perfectionist Correcting Serum for Lines/Wrinkles, Idealist Micro D Deep Thermal Refinisher, and the White Light and LightSource lines of products by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%. 24 Makeup Makeup net sales increased 13% or $274.8 million to $2,423.1 million. The growth included approximately $62 million of net sales from the launches of American Beauty and Flirt!, and higher sales of Bobbi Brown and Stila products, collectively. An increase of approximately $105 million was attributable to the recent launches of Superbalanced Compact Makeup SPF 20 and Colour Surge Eye Shadow from Clinique and Lash XL Maximum Length Mascara, Tender Blush, Pure Pops Brush on Color and AeroMatte Ultralucent Pressed Powder by Este Lauder. Also contributing to sales growth was approximately $70 million of increased sales from MACs Small Eye Shadow, Studio Fix, Lustreglass and Pro Longwear Lipcolour. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $38 million in sales of the High Impact Mascara and High Impact Eye Shadow collections and the Glosswear line of products by Clinique as well as of Pure Color Lip Vinyl by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 11%. Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 3% or $39.5 million to $1,260.6 million. The increase was due to approximately $188 million in sales generated by the fiscal 2005 launches of DKNY Be Delicious and DKNY Be Delicious Men, True Star from Tommy Hilfiger, Lauder Beyond Paradise Men from Este Lauder, Happy To Be from Clinique and Donald Trump The Fragrance. Partially offsetting the new product sales were decreases in sales of approximately $92 million of Este Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life and Clinique Simply, which were launched in the prior year, as well as decreases in sales of approximately $49 million of Tommy Jeans and Tommy from Tommy Hilfiger, certain other Aramis products and Lauder Intuition Men from Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased slightly. We expect the fragrance category to remain challenging in fiscal 2006. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 10% to $273.9 million. This increase amounting to $24.5 million was due to sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products. Aveda net sales increased as a result of sales of new professional color products and the introductions of Pure Abundance and Damage Remedy hair care products, while Bumble and bumble benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp treatment line of products and the initial shipments of Crme de Coco shampoos and conditioners. Both of these brands also benefited from new points of distribution. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 9%. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $233.4 million to $3,382.2 million. This region experienced growth in all major categories which was fueled by the diversification in our product offerings as new products and brands mitigated challenges among certain core brands and successful prior year launches. In the United States, our makeup artist and hair care brands along with products from our Aramis and Designer Fragrances Division contributed approximately $147 million to the increase. In addition, higher net sales in Canada and the inclusion of BeautyBank products contributed approximately $78 million, collectively. The Americas region may be adversely impacted by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 13% or $248.4 million to $2,118.6 million primarily due to higher net sales in the United Kingdom, our travel retail business, Spain, Portugal, South Africa and Greece of approximately $181 million, collectively. The increase in net sales included benefits from the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar as compared to various European currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 7%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 8% or $64.1 million to $835.5 million. This increase reflected higher net sales of approximately $51 million in China, Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan, partially offset by lower sales in Japan of approximately $3 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 4%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. Cost of Sales Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 25.5% and remained unchanged compared with the prior year. Favorable net changes in production and supply chain efforts of approximately 30 basis points, primarily driven by favorable material sourcing, were offset by the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories, as discussed above, which includes the impact of the BeautyBank brands. Changes in exchange rates compared with the prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin. The higher price of oil is beginning to impact our cost of raw materials and componentry, however, we believe this will not have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales margin in the near future. 25 Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands. Operating Expenses Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 63.1% from 63.4% in the prior fiscal year. Our planned increase in advertising, merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately 50 basis points was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs. We also realized a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the elimination of royalty payments previously made to Mrs. Este Lauder. In fiscal 2006, we will experience an increase in operating expenses due to the recognition of costs related to employee stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards). Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. Operating Results Based on the growth of net sales, our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously discussed, operating income increased 12% or $76.6 million to $720.6 million as compared with the prior fiscal year. Operating margins were 11.4% of net sales in the current period as compared with 11.1% in the prior fiscal year. Product Categories Operating income increased 14% or $37.2 million in makeup and 9% or $29.5 million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products. Operating results also increased 44% or $11.0 million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products. While we experienced improved results in fiscal 2005 due to these new launches, the fragrance business continues to be challenging. Hair care operating results decreased 3% or $0.8 million reflecting an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the United States as well as the opening of new points of distribution in Korea and Japan, partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed. Hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal 2005 by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a third party supplier. The situation was rectified during fiscal 2005. Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas increased 12% or $38.0 million to $357.2 million, primarily due to higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail environment, strong product launches and growth from our newer brands. As noted above, we expect results in the Americas region to be adversely impacted by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 12% or $31.7 million to $306.1 million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business, Spain, the United Kingdom and Switzerland of approximately $34 million, collectively. Partially offsetting this improvement were lower results in France, which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of major retailers, and in Russia, where we converted our business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary, of approximately $5 million on a combined basis. In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 14% or $6.9 million to $57.3 million. This increase reflected improved results in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan of approximately $11 million, collectively, partially offset by a decrease in operating income in Korea and China of approximately $6 million, combined. As China is an emerging market for us, we have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in new brand expansion and business opportunities. In addition, the Asia/Pacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new whitening products, which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal 2005. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was $13.9 million as compared with $27.1 million in the prior year. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a $16.5 million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock on June 10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and, to a lesser extent, higher interest rates. 26 Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2005 was 41.2% as compared with 37.7% in the prior year. The effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain nondeductible expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). This action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in fiscal 2005, which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million. The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately 390 basis points and an increase of approximately 120 basis points resulting from our foreign operations. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of approximately 100 basis points, a decrease in state and local income taxes of approximately 40 basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately 20 basis points. Net Earnings Net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 19% and 20%, respectively. Net earnings as compared with the prior fiscal year improved $64.0 million to $406.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved to $1.78 from $1.48. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $30.7 million or 8% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 10% to $1.78 from $1.62 in the prior fiscal year. The planned repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the AJCA, as discussed above, resulted in an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share. As noted above, net earnings in fiscal 2006 are expected to be adversely impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. In addition, we expect results in the Americas region to be adversely impacted by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company. Fiscal 2004 as Compared with Fiscal 2003 Net Sales Net sales increased 14% or $694.4 million to $5,790.4 million, reflecting growth in all product categories and all geographic regions led by double digit growth in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net sales results in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 9%. Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 13% or $246.4 million to $2,140.1 million. Approximately $60 million of this increase was attributable to the new launches of Hydra Complete Multi Level Moisture Cream and Idealist Micro D Deep Thermal Refinisher by Este Lauder and Pore Minimizer by Clinique. Additionally, growth of approximately $134 million was due to strong sales of Cliniques 3 Step Skin Care System and the Repairwear line of products from Clinique, Re Nutriv Intensive Lift Serum and Re Nutriv Intensive Eye Crme by Este Lauder and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which are primarily skin care. Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $34 million of lower net sales of certain existing products such as Advanced Stop Signs by Clinique and White Light and LightSource product lines by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 8%. Makeup Makeup net sales increased 14% or $260.5 million to $2,148.3 million, in part, due to net sales increases of our MAC and Bobbi Brown makeup artist lines of approximately $122 million, collectively. The increase in net sales also reflected approximately $79 million from the fiscal 2004 launches of Ideal Matte Refinishing Makeup SPF 8 and Electric Intense LipCreme by Este Lauder and Perfectly Real Makeup and Colour Surge Bare Brilliance by Clinique. Also contributing to net sales growth were strong sales of approximately $53 million of High Impact Mascara, High Impact Eye Shadow and Skin Clarifying Makeup by Clinique, as well as Pure Color Lip Vinyl and Artists Lip and Eye Pencils from Este Lauder. Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $30 million of lower net sales of certain existing products such as So Ingenious Multi Dimension Liquid Makeup and Pure Color Lipstick from Este Lauder and Moisture Surge Lipstick from Clinique. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 10%. 27 Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 15% or $161.5 million to $1,221.1 million, primarily attributable to the fiscal 2004 launches of Este Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life, Clinique Simply and the Tommy Jeans collection, which together contributed approximately $194 million to the growth. These product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the United States and are inclusive of improved results from our travel retail business. These net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of Este Lauder pleasures, Intuition and Beautiful, certain Tommy Hilfiger products and Clinique Happy of approximately $90 million, collectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 10%. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 9% or $20.5 million to $249.4 million. This increase resulted from sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas, new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products. Aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new Company owned Aveda Experience Centers. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of Cliniques Simple Hair Care System. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 7%. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $217.0 million to $3,148.8 million, primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands, the success of newly launched products and increases from most of our freestanding retail stores, all of which reflected the strengthening retail environment. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 24% or $363.8 million to $1,870.2 million. About $272 million was due to higher net sales from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece and South Africa, as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products. The increase includes the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 14%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 17% or $113.6 million to $771.4 million, primarily due to higher net sales of approximately $83 million in Japan, Australia, Taiwan, China and Thailand. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 9%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 25.5% from 26.0% reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately 70 basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately 60 basis points. Partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately 40 basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and re handling of goods of approximately 20 basis points. Also offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail sales, which contributed approximately 10 basis points. Travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure. Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands. OPERATING EXPENSES Our fiscal 2003 results, as reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included an adjustment for a special pre tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share, in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants. The amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year, and, at that time, we did not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future. In the following discussions, we include the results as reported and the non GAAP results. We have presented the non GAAP results because of the special nature of the charge, which affects comparability from period to period. We believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations. This is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods. There were no events or transactions subsequent to fiscal 2003 for which we believe such a discussion would be relevant. 28 In fiscal 2003, operating expenses and operating income in accordance with GAAP were $3,267.9 million or 64.1% of net sales and $503.7 million or 9.9% of net sales, respectively. Before the charge (non GAAP results) operating expenses would have been $3,245.9 million or 63.7% of net sales and operating income would have been $525.7 million or 10.3% of net sales. While we consider the non GAAP financial measures useful in analyzing our results, it is not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Fiscal 2004 operating expenses decreased to 63.4% of net sales as compared with 64.1% of net sales in fiscal 2003. Before considering the effect of the special charge, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points from 63.7% in fiscal 2003. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales, particularly in the travel retail business, as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs, partially offset by operating expenses related to BeautyBank, the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements (such as those arising under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002). Partially offsetting the net favorability in fiscal 2004 were higher levels of advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately 70 basis points. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. Under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales, royalty payments totaling $18.8 million and $20.3 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been charged to expense. Such payments were made to Mrs. Este Lauder until her death on April 24, 2004, after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust. This event resulted in a reduction of operating expenses in fiscal 2004 of $3.7 million, or $2.2 million after tax. We realized a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal 2005. OPERATING RESULTS Operating income increased 28% or $140.3 million to $644.0 million. Operating margins were 11.1% of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared with 9.9% in fiscal 2003. Absent the special charge, operating income increased 23% or $118.3 million and operating margins increased 80 basis points from fiscal 2003. These increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth, improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 7% and 17%, respectively. Net earnings improved $22.3 million to $342.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased by 17% from $1.26 to $1.48. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $49.8 million or 15% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 26% to $1.62 from $1.29 in the prior year. Absent the special charge, net earnings from continuing operations increased by $36.3 million or 11% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 21% from $1.35. The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 special charge. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Product Categories Operating income increased 23% to $336.3 million in skin care, 25% to $257.7 million in makeup and 59% to $23.6 million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product launches. Operating income decreased 23% to $24.8 million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category in the United States as well as increased support spending related to new product launch activities. Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas increased 25% or $63.9 million to $319.2 million due to sales growth resulting from an improved retail environment, strong product launches and growth from newer brands. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 21% or $46.7 million to $274.4 million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel retail business, improved operating results in the United Kingdom and Spain as well as the addition of a full year of results of the Darphin line of products, all of which contributed approximately $71 million to the increase. Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $26 million of lower gains on foreign exchange transactions and lower results in Switzerland and Italy due to difficult market conditions, collectively. In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 18% or $7.7 million to $50.4 million. This increase reflected improved results in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand, partially offset by lower results in Korea, of approximately $7 million, combined. 29 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $27.1 million as compared with $8.1 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of $17.4 million as interest expense in fiscal 2004. This change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibited us from restating fiscal 2003 results. To a lesser extent, interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2004 was 37.7% as compared with 32.9% in fiscal 2003. These rates differ from statutory rates, reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense, which are not deductible for income tax purposes (approximately 100 basis points), the mix of global earnings (approximately 150 basis points) and, to a lesser extent, the timing of certain tax planning initiatives. The fiscal 2003 rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations (approximately 230 basis points). FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of $553.3 million compared with $611.6 million at June 30, 2004. At June 30, 2005, our outstanding borrowings of $714.7 million included: (i) $246.3 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 consisting of $250.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.8 million and a $2.9 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap; (ii) $197.4 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.6 million; (iii) $68.4 million of 2015 Preferred Stock, which shares have been put to us and we intend to redeem them on October 26, 2005; (iv) a 3.0 billion yen term loan (approximately $27.2 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2005), which is due in March 2006; (v) a 1.8 million Euro note (approximately $2.2 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2005) payable semi annually through February 2008 at a variable interest rate; (vi) $9.0 million of capital lease obligations; (vii) $148.0 million of outstanding short term commercial paper payable through July 2005 at an average interest rate of 3.08%; and (viii) $16.2 million of other short term borrowings. We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States. Our commercial paper is currently rated A 1 by Standard & Poors and P 1 by Moodys. Our long term credit ratings are A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poors and A1 with a stable outlook by Moodys. At June 30, 2005, we had $148.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, which is being refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at then prevailing market interest rates. We also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional $300.0 million in debt securities and $168.5 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities, of which $16.2 million was used as of June 30, 2005. Effective May 27, 2005, we entered into a five year $600.0 million senior revolving credit facility, expiring on May 27, 2010. The new facility replaced our prior, unused $400.0 million revolving credit facility, which was effective since June 28, 2001. The new revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including financing working capital, and also as credit support for our commercial paper program. Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the facility is available for multi currency loans. The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate. We incurred debt issuance costs of $0.3 million which will be amortized over the term of the facility. The credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings. As of June 30, 2005, this facility was unused, and we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and liens. On June 28, 2005, we received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock, which requires us to purchase the preferred stock, plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon, on or before October 26, 2005. We plan to purchase the preferred stock on that date and to pay the anticipated dividends from July 1, 2005 through that date of $0.5 million at a rate based on the after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries of 2.10%, which was reset on July 1, 2005. 30 Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary. From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding. To the extent that our needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 30% at June 30, 2005 as compared with 24% at June 30, 2004. This increase primarily reflected the issuance of short term commercial paper in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate. We believe that our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $479.2 million in fiscal 2005 as compared with $675.4 million in fiscal 2004 and $558.6 million in fiscal 2003. The net decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 reflected changes in certain working capital accounts, partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes and an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. The change in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected the payment of significant deferred compensation and supplemental payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005. Accounts receivable increased as a result of sales growth in the current fiscal year, reflecting growth in international markets and customers which generally carry longer payment terms. The timing of payments from certain domestic customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the period also contributed to increased accounts receivable. The increase in inventory was primarily due to actual and anticipated sales levels, the building of safety stock in our new distribution center in Europe, and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of new points of distribution such as Kohls Department Stores for our BeautyBank brands and new affiliate activities. The shift in cash activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of disbursements year over year as well as the initiation of a vendor managed inventory program. Net deferred taxes decreased primarily as a result of the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 as a result of the AJCA and the realization of the tax benefits related to payments made to retired executives. The improvement in net operating cash flows for fiscal 2004 as compared with fiscal 2003 reflected increased net earnings from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs. Changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in anticipation of product launches in fiscal 2005, higher accounts receivable in line with sales growth, and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit related transactions as well as selling, advertising and merchandising activities. Net cash used for investing activities was $237.0 million in fiscal 2005, compared with $213.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $198.0 million in fiscal 2003. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to capital expenditures and the acquisition of Darphin and certain Aveda distributors. In fiscal 2006, we expect to make a payment of approximately $38 million to satisfy an earn out provision related to our acquisition of Jo Malone Limited in October 1999, which payment may be satisfied by the issuance of a note to the seller. Capital expenditures amounted to $229.6 million, $212.1 million and $168.6 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Incremental spending in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected the beginning of a company wide initiative to upgrade our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices. We plan to continue to invest in the upgrade of our information systems in fiscal 2006 and beyond. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment, dies and molds, new store openings, store improvements, counter construction and information technology enhancements. The lower level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 reflected tight control on our spending in light of then prevailing economic conditions. Cash used for financing activities was $300.4 million, $216.0 million and $555.0 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected common stock repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the receipt of proceeds from employee stock option transactions. The net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock, common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes and from employee stock option transactions. Net cash used for financing during fiscal 2003 primarily related to common stock repurchases, the repayment of long term debt and dividend payments. 31 Dividends On November 3, 2004, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.40 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, which was paid on December 28, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2004. Common stock dividends paid in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $90.1 million, $68.5 million and $58.3 million, respectively. Dividends paid on the preferred stock were $0.9 million, $17.4 million and $23.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in preferred stock dividends in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily reflected the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred Stock on June 10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock. The cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends have been characterized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004. Pension Plan Funding and Expense We maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our U.S. operations and a majority of our international operations. Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings. In the United States, we maintain a trust based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Qualified Plan). Additionally, we have an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations. Our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Several factors influence our annual funding requirements. For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages. Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates). The effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, there was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan required by ERISA. However, at managements discretion, we made cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan of $2.0 million and $33.0 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. During fiscal 2006, we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, we made benefit payments under our non qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $5.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively. We expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2006 of $9.5 million. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, we made cash contributions to our international pension plans of $29.2 million and $22.9 million, respectively. We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2006 of $19.9 million. In addition, at June 30, 2005 and 2004, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity for the change in such liability. During fiscal 2005, we recorded a charge, net of deferred tax, of $11.4 million while in fiscal 2004, we recorded a benefit, net of deferred tax, of $16.0 million to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Commitments and Contingencies On June 28, 2005, we received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock, which requires us to purchase the preferred stock, plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon, on or before October 26, 2005. We intend to purchase the preferred stock on that date and pay the anticipated dividends from July 1, 2005 through that date of $0.5 million at a rate based on the after tax yield on six month U.S. Treasuries of 2.10%, which was reset on July 1, 2005. Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions. These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business. The payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment will be made in fiscal 2006. Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition. For additional contingencies, refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 32 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2005: Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter (In millions) Debt service (1) $ 1,132.1 $ 291.6 $ 28.9 $ 27.5 $ 27.0 $ 26.1 $ 731.0 Operating lease commitments (2) 1,137.4 149.3 134.2 117.5 102.5 90.7 543.2 Unconditional purchase obligations (3) 1,661.4 849.0 234.0 201.0 104.4 62.0 211.0 Total contractual obligations $ 3,930.9 $ 1,289.9 $ 397.1 $ 346.0 $ 233.9 $ 178.8 $ 1,485.2 (1) Includes long term and short term debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments. Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated future earn out payments, estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement commitments, planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements. Future earn out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2005, without consideration for potential renewal periods. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates. We categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries. Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize. The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2005, these cash flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects. 33 As a matter of policy, we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts. Management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results. The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2006. Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. At June 30, 2005, we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $667.5 million and $120.9 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($128.6 million), British pound ($127.6 million), Euro ($123.3 million), Canadian dollar ($78.1 million), Australian dollar ($43.3 million), Japanese yen ($31.6 million) and South Korean won ($27.6 million). The foreign currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($33.6 million), South Korean won ($26.3 million), Euro ($21.5 million) and Swiss franc ($20.3 million). Interest Rate Risk Management We enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures. All interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six month LIBOR. We designated the swap as a fair value hedge. As of June 30, 2005, the fair value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects. Market Risk We use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments. Value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250 day period. The measured value at risk, calculated as an average, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was $6.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively. The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level. We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths. Our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended. 34 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 05 6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements. This Issue addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either (a) placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the initial lease term or (b) acquired in a business combination. Leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. This Issue shall be applied to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods after June 29, 2005 and we do not expect this Issue to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations, to address the accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations associated with Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the Directive) adopted by the European Union (EU). The Directive effectively obligates a commercial user to incur costs associated with the retirement of a specified asset that qualifies as historical waste equipment, as defined in the Directive. Commercial users of electronic equipment should apply the provisions of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), and the related FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, to the obligation associated with historical waste, since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation. The initial recognition of an asset retirement cost liability shall be recorded as an equal and offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related asset. Subsequent adjustments to the initial measurement of the asset and liability shall also be made in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 143. The guidance in this FSP shall be applied the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the law by the applicable EU member country. We are currently evaluating the impact this FSP will have on our consolidated financial statements, if any. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, (SFAS No. 154) which establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable. The statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt this statement as required, and we do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP No. 109 1), and FSP FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP No. 109 2). These staff positions provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the AJCA that was signed into law on October 22, 2004. FSP No. 109 1 states that the tax relief (special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing) from this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction. The special deduction for domestic manufacturing becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We believe this legislation and the provisions of FSP No. 109 1 will not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. FSP No. 109 2 gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No. 109. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA. This action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million, which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2005. The overall effective rate for income taxes increased from 37.7% for fiscal 2004 to 41.2% for fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the repatriation plan. 35 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). This statement replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all stock based compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair value of the award. SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2006. While we currently provide the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, on a quarterly basis (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsStock Based Compensation), we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB No. 107) was issued to provide guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to simplify some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) as this statement relates to the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies. We will apply the principles of SAB No. 107 in connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS No. 151). SFAS No. 151 requires all companies to recognize a current period charge for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials. This statement also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 36 FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders. The words and phrases will likely result, expect, believe, planned, may, should, could, anticipated, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale and future operations or operating results. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: (1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have greater resources than we do; (2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend; (3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors and ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers; (4) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for the types of products and services we sell; (5) social, political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic manufacturing, distribution and retail operations, including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the United States; (6) changes in the laws, regulations and policies that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result; (7) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States; (8) changes in global or local conditions, including those due to natural or man made disasters or energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness of consumers to travel, the financial strength of our customers or suppliers, our operations, the cost and availability of capital which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, the cost and availability of raw materials and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates; (9) shipment delays, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities which, due to consolidations in our manufacturing operations, now manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e., focus factories); (10) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities; (11) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable; (12) our ability to acquire or develop new information and distribution technologies, on a timely basis and within our cost estimates; (13) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as globalization, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom; (14) consequences attributable to the events that are currently taking place in the Middle East, including terrorist attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation; and (15) the impact of repatriating certain of our foreign earnings to the United States in connection with The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We assume no responsibility to update forward looking statements made herein or otherwise. 37 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
