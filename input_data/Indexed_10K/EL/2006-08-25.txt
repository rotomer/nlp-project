Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2006 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, concentration of credit risk, inventory, pension and other post retirement benefit costs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, derivatives and stock based compensation. Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods. In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and, in the Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customers receipt. In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale (e.g., at our retail stores). Sales are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns. Our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved. In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer. As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 5.0% in fiscal 2006 and 4.6% in fiscal 2005 and 2004. Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales. This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels. Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations. Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the solvency of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products. Concentration of Credit Risk An entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers. The significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration. During fiscal 2006, Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department Stores Company, resulting in the merger of our previous two largest customers. This customer sells products primarily within North America and accounted for $1,005.8 million, or 16%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2006 and $105.4 million, or 14%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2006. Although management believes that this customer and our other major customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of $27.1 million and $28.9 million as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings. The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $12.0 million, $12.6 million and $25.6 million for customer deductions and write offs in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and increased by $10.2 million, $11.4 million and $23.9 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends. Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale. The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead. 22 We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value, based on various product sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales. In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Qualified Plan) and an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans); a contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation; and certain other post retirement benefits. The amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables. Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels. We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings. The pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds. For fiscal 2006, we used a pre retirement discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 5.25% and varying rates on our international plans of between 1.75% and 5.50%. The pre retirement rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans. For fiscal 2006, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.75% and 7.50% for our international plans. In determining the long term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies. The U.S. Qualified Plan asset allocation as of June 30, 2006 was approximately 62% equity investments, 27% fixed income investments and 11% other investments. The asset allocation of our combined international plans as of June 30, 2006 was approximately 58% equity investments, 23% fixed income investments and 19% other investments. The difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods. For fiscal 2006, our pension plans had actual returns on assets of $64.4 million as compared with expected returns on assets of $37.0 million, which resulted in a net deferred gain of $27.4 million. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2006 pension expense: (In millions) 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease Discount rate $ (2.7 ) $ 2.8 Expected return on assets $ (1.3 ) $ 1.3 Our post retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2006 would have had the following effects: (In millions) One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest costs $ 1.7 $ (1.5 ) Effect on post retirement benefit obligations $ 12.3 $ (10.7 ) For fiscal 2007, we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the Domestic Plans of 6.25% and varying rates for our international plans of between 2.25% and 5.75%. We anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.75% and 7.25%. The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2006 will cause approximately a $1.5 million decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2007. We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. Other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized. 23 On an annual basis, or sooner if certain events or circumstances warrant, we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. To determine the fair value of these intangible assets, there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing. We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose. To mitigate undue influence, we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding years. It requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. As of June 30, 2006, we have current net deferred tax assets of $139.1 million and non current net deferred tax liabilities of $43.2 million. The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately $6.5 million for deferred tax assets, which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date, where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction. Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required. If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time. We provide tax reserves for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in managements opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. In certain circumstances, the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, including those that cannot be quantified, they could have a material impact on our results of operations, as we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (see Results of Operations, Fiscal 2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 Provision for Income Taxes). Derivatives We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value. We currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments. Variables that are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof. For a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risk. Stock Based Compensation With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005, we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, we apply the Black Scholes option pricing model. Inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, option life, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. While the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources, the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates. We use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuation. For stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of 23% based upon the implied volatility at the time of issuance. With regard to the weighted average option life assumption, we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises. Patterns are determined based on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting, realizable value, long run exercise propensity, pent up demand, stock run up effect and short time to maturity effect. For stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we used a weighted average expected option life assumption of approximately 8 years. 24 While we believe the above critical estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur, if we were to increase or decrease the expected option life by 1 year and simultaneously increase or decrease the expected volatility by 100 basis points, recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately $2.6 million in either direction for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Quantitative Analysis During the three year period ended June 30, 2006, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates. With the exception of our tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were previously inestimable (see Results of Operations, Fiscal 2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 Provision for Income Taxes), the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations. While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes. For fiscal 2006, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.6 million, operating expenses would have changed by approximately $0.7 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.0 million. The collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.3 million, $6.3 million and $.03, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories. We believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner. With this goal in mind, we have developed a long term strategy based on the following five imperatives: 1. Optimize brand portfolio 2. Strengthen product categories 3. Strengthen and expand geographic presence 4. Diversify and strengthen distribution channels 5. Achieve operational and cost excellence In fiscal 2006, our achievements included excellent growth in sales and profits in our makeup artist brands, the divestiture of Stila, the strengthening of Este Lauder pleasures, and the introduction of new products such as Missoni fragrances and Unforgivable. These makeup and fragrance efforts, together with successful niche skin care and hair care products have further strengthened our product categories. Around the globe, we generated growth in sales and profits in our travel retail business and increased our presence in China and India. In alternative channels, we continued to grow our online business, achieved double digit profitability in our MAC stores and improved our performance at our Aveda stores. Short term improvements in operational and organizational effectiveness led to improved customer service levels and better alignment of financial and inventory objectives and strategic cost cutting. We also managed to cut costs through our voluntary separation program and the related reorganization of certain operations. At the same time, we continued to make progress on our Strategic Modernization Initiative, pursuant to which we are planning to standardize business processes across our brands, operating units and sales affiliates and implement enterprise wide SAP information systems that will provide us with integrated data, processes and technologies. During fiscal 2006, we also faced challenges, many of which we expect to be ongoing in fiscal 2007. For instance, we continue to see challenges for certain of our core brands due in part to the consolidation and changes taking place among retailers and the decline in effectiveness of gift with purchase promotions. In addition, the fragrance business model continues to be a challenge, with even the most successful launches having difficulty becoming profitable. Efforts to expand geographically are complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers. Despite our efforts to diversify our distribution, there was no significant change in the mix of sales in the various channels. Continued increases in energy and raw material costs, as well as inventory obsolescence, are continuing to pressure cost of goods. As we continue to implement our strategic imperatives, we expect to make selective investments, embark on new business endeavors, and pursue initiatives that we believe will have long term benefits. The timing, impact and magnitude of any particular actions, such as an acquisition to strengthen our product categories and or diversify our distribution channels, are subject to numerous factors and cannot be predicted. Nevertheless, we expect that any such actions will impact our financial condition and or results of operations in one or more future quarterly and annual periods. 25 The following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2 and Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category. Year Ended June 30 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) NET SALES By Region: The Americas $ 3,446.4 $ 3,351.1 $ 3,120.8 Europe, the Middle East & Africa 2,147.7 2,109.1 1,863.4 Asia/Pacific 869.7 819.8 757.3 $ 6,463.8 $ 6,280.0 $ 5,741.5 By Product Category: Skin Care $ 2,400.8 $ 2,352.1 $ 2,140.1 Makeup 2,504.2 2,366.8 2,099.4 Fragrance 1,213.3 1,260.6 1,221.1 Hair Care 318.7 273.9 249.4 Other 26.8 26.6 31.5 $ 6,463.8 $ 6,280.0 $ 5,741.5 OPERATING INCOME By Region: The Americas $ 344.1 $ 366.2 $ 323.2 Europe, the Middle East & Africa 297.5 305.3 276.9 Asia/Pacific 70.1 55.3 48.8 Special charges related to cost savings initiative* (92.1 ) $ 619.6 $ 726.8 $ 648.9 By Product Category: Skin Care $ 346.4 $ 365.8 $ 336.3 Makeup 329.4 301.1 262.6 Fragrance 7.7 35.8 24.8 Hair Care 26.5 22.8 23.6 Other 1.7 1.3 1.6 Special charges related to cost savings initiative* (92.1 ) $ 619.6 $ 726.8 $ 648.9 * Refer to the following discussion in Fiscal 2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 Operating Expenses for further information regarding these charges. 26 The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended June 30 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 26.1 25.5 25.5 Gross profit 73.9 74.5 74.5 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 62.9 62.9 62.9 Special charges related to cost savings initiative 1.4 Related party royalties 0.3 64.3 62.9 63.2 Operating income 9.6 11.6 11.3 Interest expense, net 0.4 0.2 0.5 Earnings before income taxes, minority interest and discontinued operations 9.2 11.4 10.8 Provision for income taxes 4.0 4.7 4.1 Minority interest, net of tax (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Net earnings from continuing operations 5.0 6.5 6.5 Discontinued operations, net of tax (1.2 ) (0.1 ) (0.6 ) Net earnings 3.8 % 6.4 % 5.9 % In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers. The economics of developing, producing, launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Fiscal 2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 NET SALES Net sales increased 3% or $183.8 million to $6,463.8 million due to growth in our makeup, skin care and hair care product categories, which was partially offset by lower sales in our fragrance product category. The net increase reflects sales growth in all geographic regions. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 4%. Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 2% or $48.7 million to $2,400.8 million primarily due to new product launches. The recent launches of Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming Cremes and Re Nutriv Ultimate Lifting Serum by Este Lauder, and Turnaround Concentrate Visible Skin Renewer and Turnaround 15 Minute Facial by Clinique generated incremental sales of approximately $123 million, combined. Perfectionist [CP+] by Este Lauder and products in Cliniques 3 Step Skin Care System, bolstered by the introduction of Liquid Facial Soap, contributed approximately $78 million to the increase. These improvements were offset by approximately $157 million of decreases in sales of existing products in certain of our core brands as well as declines in our BeautyBank brands, which completed their initial rollout during the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 3%. Makeup Makeup net sales increased 6% or $137.4 million to $2,504.2 million reflecting growth from our makeup artist brands of approximately $179 million. This growth was partially offset by approximately $72 million of lower sales from certain existing products, reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands, and declines in our BeautyBank brands, which completed their initial rollout during the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 7%. 27 Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products decreased 4% or $47.3 million to $1,213.3 million as we continue to be challenged in this product category, particularly in the Americas region. Este Lauder Beyond Paradise and various fragrances from Clinique and Tommy Hilfiger generated approximately $106 million of lower sales. Also contributing to the decrease were lower sales of approximately $28 million of True Star by Tommy Hilfiger and Lauder Beyond Paradise Men by Este Lauder as we anniversary the initial shipments of those products in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by the recent launches of True Star Men by Tommy Hilfiger and Unforgivable by Sean John, which collectively contributed approximately $49 million to the category, and higher sales of approximately $47 million of DKNY Be Delicious and Este Lauder pleasures. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales decreased 2%. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 16% or $44.8 million to $318.7 million, primarily due to sales growth from Bumble and bumble and Aveda products. Bumble and bumble sales benefited from sales growth due to new points of distribution, increases in sales of core products and the launches of Shine and Powder products. Aveda net sales increases benefited from the recent launch of Damage Remedy hair care products, strong demand for color products and from the recent acquisition of a distributor. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 17%. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 3% or $95.3 million to $3,446.4 million. The increase was led by growth in the United States of approximately $190 million from our makeup artist and hair care brands, our internet distribution, and the introduction of the Unforgivable fragrance by Sean John. Partially offsetting this growth was approximately $122 million related to weaknesses in certain of our core brands as a result of challenges from competitive pressures and business disruptions at certain key retailers, and lower sales from our BeautyBank brands, which completed their initial rollout during the prior year. We expect business disruptions at certain key retailers in the United States to continue into fiscal 2007. Net sales growth in Canada, Latin America and Mexico contributed an additional $48 million to the increase. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 2% or $38.6 million to $2,147.7 million, reflecting higher net sales of approximately $64 million from our travel retail and distributor businesses, Russia and the United Kingdom, with all benefiting from the success of the DKNY Be Delicious franchise and the sale of MAC products. These increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately $26 million in Spain and Italy. Spains net sales were adversely affected by changes to our distribution policy and a difficult retail environment. Net sales in Italy were negatively impacted by changes to our distribution policy and, to a lesser extent, the balancing of inventory levels at its retailers. On a local currency basis, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 5%. Recent events related to the suspected terrorist activities in the United Kingdom, and subsequent restrictions on products that can be carried in flight, have created uncertainty in the outlook for our travel retail business in fiscal 2007. Based on current information, we do not believe these events will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for our fiscal 2007 first quarter or full year. In fiscal 2006, our travel retail business comprised approximately 7% of total net sales, and accounted for approximately 20% of operating income. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 6% or $49.9 million to $869.7 million. Strategic growth in China combined with positive results in Korea and Hong Kong, contributed approximately $57 million to sales growth in this region. These increases were partially offset by decreases in Japan and Australia of approximately $18 million. Japans results were negatively impacted due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. The decrease in Australia reflected slower sell through in a difficult retail environment, particularly in the fragrance category, as well as the balancing of inventory levels at a major retailer. On a local currency basis, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 7%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to 26.1% as compared with 25.5% in the prior year. This change reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 40 basis points, the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories of approximately 20 basis points, a charge related to unutilized tooling of approximately 10 basis points and 20 basis points related to commodity material prices. Partially offsetting these increases were favorable changes in promotional activities of approximately 30 basis points. 28 The higher price of oil has resulted in price increases in certain oil based chemicals, which has had a slight adverse effect on our cost of sales margin. In an ongoing effort to mitigate the impact of these increases, we are seeking potential offsetting opportunities in other categories of material purchases through our sourcing initiative in lower cost manufacturing locations worldwide. Since certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses increased to 64.3% of net sales as compared with 62.9% of net sales in the prior year. The current year operating expense margin was negatively impacted by charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative of approximately $92.1 million or approximately 140 basis points, costs related to stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) of approximately 60 basis points, and the estimated impact of both the merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company and the hurricanes that affected the southern United States of approximately 40 basis points. Partially offsetting these incremental costs were operating expense margin improvements of approximately 90 basis points primarily resulting from net sales growth in brands and channels with lower advertising, merchandising and sampling cost structures as well as an overall reduction in this type of spending. Overall operating expenses reflected savings achieved during fiscal 2006 from our cost savings initiative. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. During fiscal 2006, we recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support our long term financial objectives. As part of this multi faceted initiative, we identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes. The principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to North America based employees. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees. Under this initiative, we incurred expenses related to one time termination benefits for 494 employees, of which 28 were involuntary, which benefits were based principally upon years of service.In addition, we identified other cost savings opportunities to impr ove efficiencies in our distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs. These charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing, contract cancellations, counter and door closings and product returns. An additional $2 million to $3 million is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2007 related to the cost savings initiative.For the year ended June 30, 2006, aggregate expenses of $92.1 million were recorded as special charges related to the cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings. At June 30, 2006, $40.7 million and $28.2 million related to the cost savings initiative were recorded in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.The following table summarizes the costs and expected savings associated with our cost savings initiative, which impacted, and will continue to impact, our operating expenses and cost of sales: Fiscal 2006 expense Fiscal 2006 payments Accrued at June 30, 2006 Fiscal 2006 savings Estimated future annual savings (In millions) Employee separation expenses $ 75.9 $ 20.7 $ 55.2 $ 17.5 $ 45 Facility closures and product/distribution rationalization 12.5 12.5 11.7 21 Advertising and promotional effectiveness 3.7 2.5 1.2 9.8 10 $ 92.1 $ 23.2 $ 68.9 $ 39.0 $ 76 29 OPERATING RESULTS Operating income decreased 15%, or $107.2 million, to $619.6 million. Operating margin was 9.6% of net sales in fiscal 2006 as compared with 11.6% in the prior year. These results were negatively impacted by the effects of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of $92.1 million, or 1.4% of net sales. In addition to the special charges, net sales growth was more than offset by the increases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously discussed. The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of special charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative. We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Product Categories Operating income declined 79% or $28.1 million to $7.7 million in the fragrance product category reflecting lower sales and, to a lesser extent, expenses incurred related to development of new products and brands, partially offset by a shift in spending in certain of our core brands to other product categories. As we continue to support selected fragrances and develop new products, we anticipate the fragrance category to remain challenging during fiscal 2007. Skin care operating income decreased 5% or $19.4 million to $346.4 million primarily reflecting lower than anticipated net sales in certain of our core brands. Operating income increased 9% or $28.3 million to $329.4 million in the makeup product category primarily reflecting sales growth from our makeup artist brands, partially offset by declines in certain of our core brands. Hair care operating income increased 16% or $3.7 million to $26.5 million reflecting worldwide sales growth. In fiscal 2006, the merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company had a negative impact on the operating results of our skin care, makeup and fragrance product categories, while incremental operating expenses associated with new accounting rules for stock based compensation negatively impacted all of our product categories. Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas decreased 6% or $22.1 million to $344.1 million, primarily reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands, due in part to competitive pressures and retailer consolidations, and incremental operating expenses of approximately $33 million associated with new accounting rules for stock based compensation. The ongoing success of our makeup artist and hair care brands and our internet distribution partially offset these challenges. We expect business disruptions to continue into fiscal 2007 at certain key retailers in the United States. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income decreased 3% or $7.8 million to $297.5 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower results in Spain, Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) and Italy of approximately $20 million, collectively. These decreases were partially offset by improvements of approximately $12 million in France, our travel retail business and Central Europe (Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic). In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 27% or $14.8 million to $70.1 million. This increase reflects improved results of approximately $16 million in Korea, Japan and China, partially offset by lower results in Taiwan and Thailand of approximately $4 million, collectively. As China is an emerging market for us, we have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in new brand expansion and business opportunities there. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $23.8 million as compared with $13.9 million in the prior year. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates and, to a lesser extent, higher average debt balances due to outstanding commercial paper during the year. The increased expense was partially offset by increased interest income related to higher investment interest rates. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2006 was 43.6% as compared with 41.2% in the prior year. The effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The Companys effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring and recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies. 30 On July 13, 2006, we announced a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding its examination of our consolidated Federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998 through June 30, 2001. The settlement resolves previously disclosed issues raised during the IRSs examination, including transfer pricing and foreign tax credit computations. The settlement of these issues resulted in a tax charge of approximately $46 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and represents the aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). In connection with the repatriation, we finalized computations of the related aggregate tax impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11 million. The tax settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net increase to our fiscal 2006 income tax provision of approximately $35 million. The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the tax settlement charge of approximately 770 basis points, an increase of approximately 60 basis points resulting from our foreign operations and an increase in nondeductible expenses of approximately 30 basis points. These increases were partially offset by the net reduction in the incremental tax charge relative to the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the AJCA of approximately 570 basis points, as well as a reduction of approximately 50 basis points for miscellaneous items. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On April 10, 2006 (the Effective Date), we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products to Stila Corp. (the Purchaser), an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for consideration of $23.0 million. The sale price included cash of $9.3 million, a promissory note with a notional value of $13.3 million and a fair value of $11.0 million and convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $5.0 million and a fair value of $2.7 million. As additional consideration for the purchased assets, and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale agreement, the Purchaser will pay us an amount equal to two percent of the annual net sales of the acquired business during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending August 20, 2019. We will use these proceeds to satisfy our commitment under the 1999 agreement pursuant to which we originally purchased the Stila business. The Purchaser immediately assumed responsibility for all decisions regarding the operations of the Stila business and we agreed to divest ourself of continuing involvement in the Stila business, except as described below. In fiscal 2006, we recorded charges of $80.3 million (net of $43.3 million tax benefit) to discontinued operations, which reflected the loss on the disposition of the business of $69.9 million, net of tax, and adjustments to the fair value of assets sold, the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the Purchaser and other costs in connection with the sale. The charges also include the operating losses of $10.4 million, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Net sales associated with the discontinued operations were $45.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. All statements of earnings information for the prior years has been restated for comparative purposes, including the restatement of the makeup product category and each of the geographic regions presented in Note 17 Segment Data and Related Information. In order to facilitate the transition of the Stila business to the Purchaser, we agreed to provide certain information systems, accounting and other back office services to the Purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the estimated costs of providing these transition services. We also agreed with the Purchaser to provide certain distribution and online services. In both cases, the services are expected to conclude in fiscal 2007. In addition, we agreed to manufacture and sell to the Purchaser a limited range of products for a period of up to four months following the Effective Date and, in the case of one product, of up to two years. NET EARNINGS Net earnings as compared with the prior fiscal year declined $161.9 million or 40% to $244.2 million and diluted net earnings per common share decreased 37% from $1.78 to $1.12. Net earnings from continuing operations as compared with the prior fiscal year decreased by $85.4 million or 21% to $324.5 million and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased 17% from $1.80 to $1.49. Fiscal 2005 as Compared with Fiscal 2004 NET SALES Net sales increased 9% or $538.5 million to $6,280.0 million reflecting growth in all major product categories, led by makeup and skin care, and growth in all geographic regions, led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 7%. 31 Product Categories Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 10% or $212.0 million to $2,352.1 million. Approximately $179 million of this sales increase was related to the introduction of Future Perfect Anti Wrinkle Radiance Creme SPF 15 and launches in the Perfectionist and Re Nutriv product lines by Este Lauder, launches of Superdefense Triple Action Moisturizers SPF 25 and certain Repairwear products by Clinique, the introduction of certain American Beauty and Good Skin products and the recent launch of Modern Friction by Origins. On a combined basis, strong sales of products in Cliniques 3 Step Skin Care System and The Lifting Face Serum & The Lifting Intensifier by La Mer contributed approximately $29 million to the sales increase. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $52 million in sales of Perfectionist Correcting Serum for Lines/Wrinkles, Idealist Micro D Deep Thermal Refinisher, and the White Light and LightSource lines of products by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%. Makeup Makeup net sales increased 13% or $267.4 million to $2,366.8 million. The growth included approximately $56 million of net sales from the launches of American Beauty and Flirt!, and higher sales of Bobbi Brown products, collectively. An increase of approximately $105 million was attributable to the recent launches of Superbalanced Compact Makeup SPF 20 and Colour Surge Eye Shadow from Clinique and Lash XL Maximum Length Mascara, Tender Blush, Pure Pops Brush on Color and AeroMatte Ultralucent Pressed Powder by Este Lauder. Also contributing to sales growth was approximately $70 million of increased sales from MACs Small Eye Shadow, Studio Fix, Lustreglass and Pro Longwear Lipcolour. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $38 million in sales of the High Impact Mascara and High Impact Eye Shadow collections and the Glosswear line of products by Clinique as well as of Pure Color Lip Vinyl by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 11%. Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 3% or $39.5 million to $1,260.6 million. The increase was due to approximately $188 million in sales generated by the fiscal 2005 launches of DKNY Be Delicious and DKNY Be Delicious Men, True Star from Tommy Hilfiger, Lauder Beyond Paradise Men from Este Lauder, Happy To Be from Clinique and Donald Trump The Fragrance. Partially offsetting the new product sales were decreases in sales of approximately $92 million of Este Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life and Clinique Simply, which were launched in the prior year, as well as decreases in sales of approximately $49 million of Tommy Jeans and Tommy from Tommy Hilfiger, certain other Aramis products and Lauder Intuition Men from Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased slightly. The fragrance category remained challenging in fiscal 2006. Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 10% to $273.9 million. This increase amounting to $24.5 million was due to sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products. Aveda net sales increased as a result of sales of new professional color products and the introductions of Pure Abundance and Damage Remedy hair care products, while Bumble and bumble benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp treatment line of products and the initial shipments of Crme de Coco shampoos and conditioners. Both of these brands also benefited from new points of distribution. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 9%. Geographic Regions Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $230.3 million to $3,351.1 million. This region experienced growth in all major categories which was fueled by the diversification in our product offerings as new products and brands mitigated challenges among certain core brands and successful fiscal 2004 launches. In the United States, our makeup artist and hair care brands along with products from our Aramis and Designer Fragrances Division contributed approximately $145 million to the increase. In addition, higher net sales in Canada and the inclusion of BeautyBank products contributed approximately $76 million, collectively. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 13% or $245.7 million to $2,109.1 million primarily due to higher net sales in the United Kingdom, our travel retail business, Spain, Portugal, South Africa and Greece of approximately $179 million, collectively. The increase in net sales included benefits from the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar as compared to various European currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 7%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 8% or $62.5 million to $819.8 million. This increase reflected higher net sales of approximately $51 million in China, Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan, partially offset by lower sales in Japan of approximately $4 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 4%. We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth. 32 COST OF SALES Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 25.5% and remained unchanged compared with fiscal 2004. Favorable net changes in production and supply chain efforts of approximately 30 basis points, primarily driven by favorable material sourcing, were offset by the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories, as discussed above, which includes the impact of the BeautyBank brands. Changes in exchange rates compared with the prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin. Since certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 62.9% from 63.2% in fiscal 2004. Our planned increase in advertising, merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately 50 basis points was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs. We also realized a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the elimination of royalty payments previously made to Mrs. Este Lauder. Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized. OPERATING RESULTS Based on the growth of net sales, our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously discussed, operating income increased 12% or $77.9 million to $726.8 million as compared with the prior fiscal year. Operating margins were 11.6% of net sales in fiscal 2005 as compared with 11.3% in fiscal 2004. Product Categories Operating income increased 15% or $38.5 million in makeup and 9% or $29.5 million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products. Operating results also increased 44% or $11.0 million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products. While we experienced improved results in fiscal 2005 due to these new launches, the fragrance business continues to be challenging. Hair care operating results decreased 3% or $0.8 million reflecting an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the United States as well as the opening of new points of distribution in Korea and Japan, partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed. Hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal 2005 by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a third party supplier. The situation was rectified during fiscal 2005. Geographic Regions Operating income in the Americas increased 13% or $43.0 million to $366.2 million, primarily due to higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail environment, strong product launches and growth from our newer brands. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 10% or $28.4 million to $305.3 million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business, Spain, the United Kingdom and Switzerland of approximately $33 million, collectively. Partially offsetting this improvement were lower results in France, which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of major retailers, and in Russia, where we converted our business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary, of approximately $6 million on a combined basis. In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 13% or $6.5 million to $55.3 million. This increase reflected improved results in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan of approximately $10 million, collectively, partially offset by a decrease in operating income in Korea and China of approximately $6 million, combined. In addition, the Asia/Pacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new whitening products, which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal 2005. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense was $13.9 million as compared with $27.1 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a $16.5 million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock on June 10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and, to a lesser extent, higher interest rates. 33 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2005 was 41.2% as compared with 37.7% in fiscal 2004. The effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain nondeductible expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which included $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA. This action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in fiscal 2005, which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million. The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately 390 basis points and an increase of approximately 110 basis points resulting from our foreign operations. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of approximately 90 basis points, a decrease in state and local income taxes of approximately 40 basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately 20 basis points. NET EARNINGS Net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 19% and 20%, respectively. Net earnings as compared with fiscal 2004 improved $64.0 million to $406.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved to $1.78 from $1.48. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $31.4 million or 8% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 10% to $1.80 from $1.64 in the prior fiscal year. The planned repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the AJCA, as discussed above, resulted in an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million, or $.12 per diluted common share. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $368.6 million compared with $553.3 million at June 30, 2005. At June 30, 2006, our outstanding borrowings of $521.5 million included: (i) $230.0 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 consisting of $250.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and a $19.4 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap; (ii) $197.4 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.6 million; (iii) a 1.8 million Euro note (approximately $1.9 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2006) payable semi annually through February 2008 at a variable interest rate; (iv) $7.1 million of capital lease obligations; (v) a 3.0 billion yen short term borrowing under a revolving credit facility (approximately $26.2 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2006); (vi) $38.0 million of outstanding loan participation notes due July 2006 at an initial interest rate of 5.41%; and (vii) $20.9 million of other short term borrowings. We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States. Our commercial paper is currently rated A 1 by Standard & Poors and P 1 by Moodys. Our long term credit ratings are A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poors and A1 with a stable outlook by Moodys. At June 30, 2006, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional $300.0 million in debt securities and $150.2 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities, of which $20.9 million was used as of June 30, 2006. We have an unused $600.0 million senior revolving credit facility that expires on May 27, 2010. The facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including financing working capital, and also as credit support for our commercial paper program. Up to the equivalent of $250.0 million of the facility is available for multi currency loans. The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or the Federal funds rate plus %. The credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings. As of June 30, 2006, we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and liens. 34 In May 2006, we entered into a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution for the primary purpose of funding cash dividend repatriations from certain of our international affiliates to the United States as permitted by the AJCA. Under the agreement, we may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes which were issued by one of our subsidiaries in Europe. The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement will be an all in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing. At June 30, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under this agreement and the notes are being refinanced on a periodic basis as they mature at the then prevailing market interest rates. Debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis. In March 2006, we entered into a 3.0 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires on March 24, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate) and a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance. We borrowed 3.0 billion yen under the new facility on March 28, 2006 to repay the previously outstanding 3.0 billion yen term loan that was to mature on that date. The outstanding balance at June 30, 2006 ($26.2 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2006) is classified as short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. In October 2005, we redeemed the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock that was outstanding at June 30, 2005 and paid the accrued dividends thereon. Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary. From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding. To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper or loan participation notes, issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility or other credit facilities. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 24% at June 30, 2006 and 30% at June 30, 2005. The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate. We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $709.8 million in fiscal 2006 as compared with $478.1 million in fiscal 2005. The net increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 primarily reflected favorable changes in certain working capital accounts, partially offset by a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations. Net accounts receivable balances decreased primarily reflecting higher collections domestically during fiscal 2006. Inventory levels remained constant at June 30, 2006 as compared to June 30, 2005 due to our efforts to better manage our inventory. Increases in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected higher advertising, merchandising and sampling accruals compared to the prior year, as well as significant deferred compensation and supplemental pension payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005. Additional increases in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities reflected accrued employee separation benefits related to the Companys cost savings initiative. Net cash provided by operating activities was $478.1 million in fiscal 2005 and $673.0 million in fiscal 2004. The net decrease reflected changes in certain working capital accounts, partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes and an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. The change in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected the payment of significant deferred compensation and supplemental payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005. Accounts receivable increased as a result of sales growth in fiscal 2005, reflecting growth in international markets and customers which generally carry longer payment terms. The timing of payments from certain domestic customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the period also contributed to increased accounts receivable. The increase in inventory was primarily due to actual and anticipated sales levels, the building of safety stock in our new distribution center in Europe, and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of new points of distribution. The shift in cash activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of disbursements year over year as well as the initiation of a vendor managed inventory program. Net deferred taxes decreased primarily due to the then anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 as a result of the AJCA and the realization of the tax benefits related to payments made to retired executives. Net cash used for investing activities was $303.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared with $237.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $213.7 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the cash payment related to the Jo Malone Limited earn out provision and, to a lesser extent, Aveda distributor acquisitions. Capital expenditures also increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting our continuing company wide initiative to upgrade our information systems, which was initiated in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures reflected those costs related to our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment, dies and molds, new store openings, store improvements, counter construction and information technology enhancements. In fiscal 2007, we expect to purchase the remaining equity interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC. 35 Cash used for financing activities was $594.6 million, $300.4 million and $216.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition to common stock repurchases and dividend payments, cash flows used for financing activities reflected the repayment of short term commercial paper that was outstanding at June 30, 2005 and the October 2005 redemption of the remaining 2015 Preferred Stock. These outflows were partially offset by short term borrowings under our loan participation note program. The 3.0 billion yen term loan outstanding at the end of fiscal 2005 was refinanced by borrowings under the new 3.0 billion yen revolving credit facility that we entered into in March 2006. The net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected common stock repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the receipt of proceeds from employee stock option transactions. The net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock, common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes and from employee stock option transactions. Dividends On November 10, 2005, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.40 per share, or $85.5 million, on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, which was paid on December 28, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2005. The annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2005 was $.40 per share, or $90.1 million, which was paid on December 28, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2004. Dividends on the 2015 Preferred Stock were $0.5 million and $0.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These dividends have been characterized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the respective fiscal years. Pension Plan Funding and Expense We maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our U.S. operations and a majority of our international operations. Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings. In the United States, we maintain a trust based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Qualified Plan). Additionally, we have an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations. Our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Several factors influence our annual funding requirements. For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages. Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and subsequent pension legislation, and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates). The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. For fiscal 2006 and 2005, there was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan required by ERISA. However, while we did not make any cash contributions pursuant to the plan during fiscal 2006, we made cash contributions of $2.0 million during fiscal 2005 at managements discretion. During fiscal 2007, we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan. For fiscal 2006 and 2005, we made benefit payments under our non qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $7.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively. We expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2007 of $10.3 million. For fiscal 2006 and 2005, we made cash contributions to our international pension plans of $25.7 million and $29.2 million, respectively. We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2007 of $18.8 million. In addition, at June 30, 2006 and 2005, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity for the change in such liability. During fiscal 2006, we recorded a benefit, net of deferred tax, of $29.9 million while in fiscal 2005, we recorded a charge, net of deferred tax, of $11.4 million to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Commitments and Contingencies Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions. These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business. The payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment will be made in fiscal 2007, when we expect to purchase the remaining equity interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC. Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition. For additional contingencies, refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 36 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2006: Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In millions) Debt service(1) $ 982.9 $ 120.6 $ 34.1 $ 31.6 $ 30.6 $ 30.6 $ 735.4 Operating lease commitments(2) 1,224.3 157.7 145.8 134.2 118.9 102.2 565.5 Unconditional purchase obligations(3) 1,365.6 872.8 200.8 64.3 84.0 41.3 102.4 Cost savings initiative obligations(4) 70.5 41.2 18.6 5.5 2.6 2.6 Total contractual obligations $ 3,643.3 $ 1,192.3 $ 399.3 $ 235.6 $ 236.1 $ 176.7 $ 1,403.3 (1) Includes long term and short term debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.

(4) Refer to Results of Operations, Fiscal 2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 Operating Expenses. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates. We categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with our identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries. Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize. The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges. Hedge effectiveness of forward exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot forward difference which is recorded in current period earnings. Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology. The ineffective portion of both forward exchange and foreign currency option contracts is recorded in current period earnings. For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to current period earnings. As of June 30, 2006, these cash flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects. As a matter of policy, we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts. Management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results. The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2007. Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 37 At June 30, 2006, we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $782.6 million and $130.2 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($238.5 million), Swiss franc ($98.5 million), British pound ($92.4 million), Canadian dollar ($71.7 million), Japanese yen ($50.6 million), Australian dollar ($50.5 million) and South Korean won ($33.1 million). The foreign currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($32.0 million), Euro ($27.7 million), Canadian dollar ($22.8 million), Swiss franc ($14.8 million) and South Korean won ($13.4 million). Interest Rate Risk Management We enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures. All interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. We have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six month LIBOR. We designated the swap as a fair value hedge. As of June 30, 2006, the fair value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects. Market Risk We use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments. Value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250 day period. The measured value at risk, calculated as an average, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was $10.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively. The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level. We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths. Our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 also prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions. The first step is recognition and the second is measurement. For recognition, an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. If the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date of FIN 48 may be recognized or, continue to be recognized, upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. FIN 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective for us in fiscal 2008 and are unable, at this time, to quantify the impact, if any, to retained earnings at the time of adoption. 38 FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.
