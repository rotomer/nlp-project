ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS beginning on page 23. All dollar amounts in this MD&A are in millions, except per share amounts. The following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total revenues. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Revenues Information storage systems 60.7 % 70.4 % 68.0 % Information storage software 22.0 16.2 12.2 Information storage services 13.7 6.9 5.4 Total information storage revenue 96.5 93.5 85.6 Other businesses 3.5 6.5 14.4 Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost and expenses Cost of sales 59.9 % 42.1 % 48.5 % Research and development 13.1 8.8 8.5 Selling, general and administrative 31.2 23.7 21.4 Restructuring, merger and special charges 5.6 3.1 Operating income (loss) (9.8 ) 25.4 18.5 Investment income, interest expense and other income (expense), net 1.7 2.1 1.7 Income (loss) before income taxes (8.1 ) 27.5 20.2 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (0.9 ) 7.4 5.2 Net income (loss) (7.2 )% 20.1 % 15.0 % Revenues Total revenues were $7,090.6, $8,872.8 and $6,715.6 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,782.2, or 20%, from 2000 to 2001 and an increase of $2,157.2, or 32%, from 1999 to 2000. Information storage systems revenues were $4,307.2, $6,245.8 and $4,565.0 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,938.6, or 31%, from 2000 to 2001, and an increase of $1,680.8, or 37%, from 1999 to 2000. The decrease in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to declining sales volume. Sales were negatively influenced by the global economic slowdown experienced during 2001, further exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which led to a reduction in information technology spending. Competitive pricing pressures also had an adverse effect on revenues. Continued adverse changes in the economy, further reductions in information technology spending or continued pricing pressures may negatively impact revenues in 2002. The increase in revenues in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to 13 increased sales volume resulting from the continued demand for our Symmetrix and CLARiiON products and the successful introduction of new products within those existing product lines. Information storage software revenues were $1,560.0, $1,435.1 and $821.7 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing increases of $124.9, or 9%, from 2000 to 2001, and $613.4, or 75%, from 1999 to 2000. The increases were primarily due to increased licenses of information storage software on both newly shipped and already installed systems and the successful introduction of new and enhanced software products. Information storage services revenues were $972.3, $612.1 and $361.8 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing increases of $360.2, or 59%, from 2000 to 2001, and $250.3, or 69%, from 1999 to 2000. The increases were primarily due to an increased number of professional services contracts and an increased number of maintenance contracts for information storage systems and software. Total information storage revenues were $6,839.5, $8,293.0 and $5,748.5 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,453.5, or 18%, from 2000 to 2001, and an increase of $2,544.5, or 44%, from 1999 to 2000. Other businesses revenues were $251.1, $579.8 and $967.1 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing a decrease of $328.7, or 57%, from 2000 to 2001, and a decrease of $387.3, or 40%, from 1999 to 2000. Other businesses revenues consist of revenues from AViiON server products and related services. The decreases in other businesses revenues were due to refocusing efforts on lines of business within the storage segments. In the third quarter of 2001, we stopped selling the AViiON server products. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2001 and thereafter, other businesses revenues are and will be comprised only of AViiON services revenues. These revenues are expected to decline in 2002. Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $4,185.4, $5,436.2 and $4,257.1 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,250.8, or 23%, from 2000 to 2001, and an increase of $1,179.1, or 28%, from 1999 to 2000. Revenues on sales into the European, Middle East and African markets were $1,774.9, $2,351.8 and $1,844.3 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing a decrease of $576.9, or 25%, from 2000 to 2001, and an increase of $507.5, or 28%, from 1999 to 2000. Revenues on sales into the Asia Pacific markets were $893.4, $880.1 and $439.0 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing increases of $13.3, or 2%, from 2000 to 2001 and $441.1, or 100%, from 1999 to 2000. Revenues on sales into the Latin American markets were $237.0, $204.7 and $175.2 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing increases of $32.3, or 16%, from 2000 to 2001, and $29.5, or 17%, from 1999 to 2000. The decline in revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 in the North American markets and the European, Middle East and African markets was attributable to the global economic slow down, the impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and price reductions. The increase in revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 in the Asia Pacific and the Latin American markets resulted from our efforts to expand our sales infrastructure throughout the world to meet demand for information storage products and services. While revenues increased in these markets, the increases were lower than anticipated due to the aforementioned factors affecting the other regions. The increase in revenues in all markets in 2000 compared to 1999 was attributable to increases in sales volume resulting from the worldwide increase in demand for information storage products and services. Changes in exchange rates in 2001 compared to 2000 negatively impacted revenues by approximately 3%. The impact was most significant in Japan, Brazil and Germany. Changes in exchange rates in 2000 compared to 1999 negatively impacted revenue by approximately 2%. The impact was most significant in Germany, Japan, France, Belgium and the United Kingdom. Gross Margins Gross margin dollars decreased to $2,843.6 in 2001 from $5,143.1 in 2000, a decrease of $2,299.5, or 45%. The 2001 amount reflects a charge of $320.1 for excess and obsolete inventory and impaired capitalized 14 software. Excluding this charge, gross margin dollars decreased to $3,163.7, a decrease of $1,979.4, or 38%. The decline in gross margin dollars in 2001 was primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues resulting from a reduction in both the volume of systems shipped and the average selling price of such systems. The overall gross margin percentage, excluding the charge, decreased to 44.6% in 2001 compared to 58.0% in 2000. Gross margin dollars increased to $5,143.1 in 2000 from $3,457.4 in 1999, an increase of $1,685.7, or 49%. The increase in gross margin dollars in 2000 was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues. The overall gross margin percentage increased to 58.0% in 2000 compared to 51.5% in 1999. In the third quarter of 2001, due to the decline in demand for information storage products and our development of new technologies, we evaluated our inventory and determined that $310.0 was not recoverable. In addition, we discontinued selling certain information storage software products, resulting in the write off of $10.1 of unamortized capitalized software. Excluding the charge, the gross margin on information storage products decreased to 46.0% in 2001 compared to 61.4% in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales volume resulting in the absorption of fixed overhead costs over a lower revenue base. In addition, reduced sales prices associated with competitive pricing negatively impacted margins, partially offset by information storage software revenues, which as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 22% in 2001, compared to 16% in 2000. Information storage software has a higher gross margin than information storage systems. Should we experience further reductions in sales volumes or continued pricing pressures in 2002, gross margins may be further negatively impacted. Gross margins for information storage products increased to 61.4% in 2000 compared to 56.3% in 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to increased licensing of our information storage software products. Information storage software revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 16% in 2000 from 12% in 1999. Gross margins were also affected by component cost declines, which were greater than product price declines. Gross margins for information storage services increased to 38.4% in 2001 compared to 33.8% in 2000 and 26.1% in 1999. The increases in the gross margin percentages were attributable to greater productivity of our customer service and professional services personnel. Gross margins for other businesses decreased to 36.8% in 2001 compared to 37.8% in 2000 and 34.0% in 1999. Our decision to stop selling the AViiON server product in the third quarter of 2001 contributed to the decline in gross margins in 2001. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2000 compared to 1999 reflects our efforts to refocus the business on our most profitable products and services. Research and Development Research and development (R&D) expenses were $928.7, $783.2 and $572.5 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. R&D expenses increased 19% in 2001 compared to 2000, and increased 37% in 2000 compared to 1999. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 13.1%, 8.8% and 8.5% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In addition, we spent $120.7, $102.8 and $88.2 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, on software development, which costs were capitalized. The increase in R&D spending from 2000 to 2001 and 1999 to 2000 reflects our efforts to continue to improve our long term competitive position. These efforts include enhancements to information storage software and information storage systems, including networked information storage systems. Significant efforts underway in 2001 and expected to continue through 2002 include R&D associated with our new software strategy, AutoIS, as well as enhancements to both our Symmetrix and CLARiiON systems. We will continue with our R&D efforts; however, the overall level of spending is expected to be lower in 2002 compared to 2001. 15 Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $2,214.2, $2,103.0 and $1,435.5 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. SG&A expenses increased 5% in 2001 compared to 2000 and increased 46% in 2000 compared to 1999. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 31.2%, 23.7% and 21.4% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in spending in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to efforts to expand sales and build an infrastructure to support an increased revenue base. The increase in SG&A in 2001 compared to 2000 was also due to efforts to expand sales, partially offset by reductions implemented in the second half of 2001 to achieve a cost structure commensurate with reduced revenue levels. Restructuring, Merger and Other Special Charges 2001 Restructuring Program General As a result of the decline in general economic and business conditions in 2001, we implemented several workforce reductions. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2001, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on the highest potential growth areas of our business. We also recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and recognized an other than temporary decline in certain of our equity investments. As a result, in the third quarter of 2001, we incurred an aggregate pre tax charge of $825.2 for restructuring costs and other special charges that included the following components: Worldwide Reduction in Force Our third quarter 2001 restructuring program included a reduction in force of approximately 4,000 employees across all business functions and geographic regions. Approximately 62% of such employees are or were based in North America and the remainder are or were based in Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax charge of $111.5 for termination benefits. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 2,750 employees had been terminated with the remainder expected to be terminated by the end of the second quarter of 2002. Additionally, as a result of the sale of an information storage services business, we reduced our workforce by an additional 426 employees in the fourth quarter of 2001. Impairment of Goodwill, Purchased Intangibles and Other Long Lived Assets The restructuring program included terminating the sale of AViiON servers, exiting certain aspects of the media solutions business and certain aspects of the information storage services business and discontinuing the sale of certain software products. As a result, a pre tax charge of $104.5 related to the impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and other long lived assets was taken. The impairment charge is equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded the present value of their estimated discounted future cash flows. Additionally, a pre tax charge of $34.5 was taken to recognize the cost of related and other contractual obligations for which we will no longer derive an economic benefit. Consolidation of Excess Facilities and Other Special Charges The restructuring program included a pre tax charge of $158.1 for the consolidation of space within our corporate headquarters and nearby facilities and elimination of excess field office space worldwide. Included in the charge is $110.1 for lease terminations and estimated losses on subleases and $48.0 for non recoverable investments in buildings and leasehold improvements. 16 A summary of the restructuring cost is outlined as follows: Provision Adjustments to the provision Current year utilization Ending balance Workforce reduction $ 111.5 $ (18.3 ) $ (45.0 ) $ 48.2 Impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and other long lived assets and related and other contractual obligations 139.0 (8.0 ) (107.3 ) 23.7 Consolidation of excess facilities 158.1 26.3 (57.0 ) 127.4 Total $ 408.6 $ $ (209.3 ) $ 199.3 The adjustment to the provision for the workforce reduction primarily relates to voluntary employee resignations. The adjustment to the provision for the impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and other long lived assets and related and other contractual obligations represents a favorable settlement of an estimated liability for the closure of an information storage services business. The adjustment for the consolidation of excess facilities primarily relates to additional leased facilities being vacated. Provision for Excess and Obsolete Inventory We recorded a $310.0 pre tax provision for excess and obsolete inventory. Due to the decline in demand for information storage products and our development of new technologies, we evaluated our inventory and determined that $310.0 was not recoverable. As of December 31, 2001, we had charged $54.5 against the reserve, leaving a balance of $255.5. Other than Temporary Investment Declines We recorded a pre tax charge of $106.6 for other than temporary declines in equity investments. These investments are in privately held companies, primarily in the storage industry, many of which are in the start up or development stage. These investments are carried at cost, subject to adjustment for impairment. Due to the continued global economic slow down in 2001, as well as the downturn in the storage industry, we determined that the decline in these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss. The classification of the restructuring costs and other special charges in the statement of operations consists of $398.5 contained within restructuring, merger and other special charges, $320.1 contained in cost of product sales, consisting of $310.0 of excess and obsolete inventory and $10.1 of impaired capitalized software, and $106.6 contained in other income (expense), net. The restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 2002, although our ability to sell and sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions. The expected cash impact of the charge is $254.7, of which $55.4 was paid in 2001. Remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reductions and contractual obligations are expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2002. Amounts relating to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2015. We expect to reduce costs in all areas of our operations as a result of the restructuring program, favorably impacting cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. Once fully implemented, the restructuring program, together with the second quarter 2001 reduction in force of approximately 1,100 people, is expected to reduce costs by approximately $800.0 per year. 1999 Restructuring Program During 1999, we recorded a charge of $223.6 related to restructuring, merger and other special charges primarily associated with the acquisition of Data General. The restructuring provided for the consolidation of our 17 operations and elimination of duplicative facilities worldwide. Accordingly, we recognized $170.6 related to employee termination benefits, facility closure costs, asset disposals and other exit costs. The restructuring included a reduction of the workforce by approximately 1,100 employees, of which approximately 500 were terminated in 1999 and approximately 600 were terminated in 2000. The charge also includes merger costs of $23.5 for financial advisory services, legal, accounting and other direct expenses related to the Data General acquisition. In addition, we recorded a $14.1 charge related to asset impairments and $15.4 for capitalized software and inventory write downs. The expected cash impact of the charge is $164.1, of which $72.7 was paid in 1999, $61.1 was paid in 2000 and $6.4 was paid in 2001. The remaining obligations relate to executive severance that continues through 2005. The classification of the charges in the statement of operations consists of $208.2 contained within restructuring, merger and other special charges and $15.4 contained in cost of product sales. 1998 Restructuring Program In 1998, we recorded a charge of $135.0 related to a Data General restructuring program and certain asset write downs resulting from the program. The charge included $82.4 related to employee termination benefits, asset write downs and other exit costs and $52.6 for capitalized software and inventory write downs. The expected cash impact of the restructuring charge is $58.5, of which $24.4 was paid in 1998, $21.6 was paid in 1999, $3.0 was paid in 2000 and $0.4 was paid in 2001. The remaining obligations relate to lease payments that continue through 2015. The restructuring included a reduction of the workforce by approximately 480 employees, of which 400 were terminated in 1998 and 80 were terminated in 1999. The amounts accrued and charged against the established provisions for the 1999 and 1998 restructuring programs for each of the three years ended December 31, is as follows: Beginning balance Current year provision Current year utilization Ending balance 2001 Workforce reduction $ 23.4 $ $ (4.1 ) $ 19.3 Asset disposal and other exit costs 2.8 (2.8 ) Consolidation of excess facilities 15.5 (0.9 ) 14.6 Total $ 41.7 $ $ (7.8 ) $ 33.9 2000 Workforce reduction $ 75.5 $ $ (52.1 ) $ 23.4 Asset disposal and other exit costs 15.3 (12.5 ) 2.8 Consolidation of excess facilities 18.6 (3.1 ) 15.5 Total $ 109.4 $ $ (67.7 ) $ 41.7 1999 Workforce reduction $ 21.4 $ 121.5 $ (67.4 ) $ 75.5 Asset disposal and other exit costs 8.8 37.9 (31.4 ) 15.3 Consolidation of excess facilities 13.3 11.2 (5.9 ) 18.6 Total $ 43.5 $ 170.6 $ (104.7 ) $ 109.4 18 Investment Income and Interest Expense Investment income increased to $265.3 in 2001, from $206.2 in 2000 and $131.9 in 1999. Investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents, short and long term investments and sales type leases. Investment income increased in 2001 primarily due to greater realized gains on sale of investments. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was due to higher average cash and investment balances. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains, was 4.8%, 5.8% and 5.8% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Interest expense decreased to $11.3 in 2001 from $14.6 in 2000 and $33.5 in 1999. The decreases in 2001 compared to 2000 and 2000 compared to 1999 were primarily due to the conversion of our 3 % convertible subordinated notes due 2002 in March 2000 and our 6% convertible subordinated notes due 2004 in May 2000. Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense, net was $133.1 in 2001 and $7.3 in 2000 compared with other income, net of $17.7 in 1999. Included in the 2001 amount was a third quarter $106.6 non cash charge for other than temporary declines in equity investments. These investments are in privately held companies, primarily in the storage industry, many of which are in the start up or development stage. These investments are carried at cost, subject to adjustment for impairment. Due to the continued global economic slow down in 2001, as well as the downturn in the storage industry, we determined that the decline in value of these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss. The increase in other expense, net, in 2000 compared to 1999 was due to an increase in the losses from the sale of fixed assets and an increase in the earnings, which includes the minoritys share in such earnings, of McDATA Corporation, our former majority owned subsidiary. The minoritys share in the earnings of McDATA are accounted for as an item included in other expense. We distributed our ownership interest in McDATA in 2001. Provision for Income Taxes The benefit for income taxes was $69.3 for 2001 compared to a provision for income taxes of $659.1 in 2000 and a provision of $346.6 in 1999. As a result of our loss in 2001, we had an income tax benefit with an effective rate of 12.0%. In 2000 and 1999, we had pre tax earnings resulting in effective tax rates of 27.0% in 2000 and 25.5% in 1999. Our worldwide tax structure provides for an overall lower effective tax rate compared to the statutory tax rate in years in which there is income. However, in years in which there is a loss, we do not receive a commensurate benefit. The effective tax rates in 2001, 2000 and 1999 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to our global tax strategies and the effect of our European manufacturing operations. The rate of benefit in 2001 is lower than the rate of the tax provision in 2000 due to the mix of income and losses in foreign countries. The 2001 rate was also adversely affected by providing for the potential tax consequences resulting from audits in several foreign tax jurisdictions, partially offset by benefits realized from the favorable resolution of a merger related contingency. Financial Condition Cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were $5,083.6 and $4,745.3 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $338.3. In 2001, cash and cash equivalents increased by $145.8 and short and long term investments increased by $192.5. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,631.3 in 2001 compared to $2,108.7 in 2000 and $1,389.6 in 1999. The decline in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily attributable to the $507.7 loss incurred in the year. Offsetting the loss was an overall improvement in working capital associated with substantial reductions in accounts and notes receivable and inventories. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to growth in net income. 19 Cash used for investing activities was $1,513.6, $1,842.4 and $1,188.9 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Capital additions were $889.3, $858.4 and $542.2 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in capital additions resulted from the expansion of our infrastructure. Net purchases and maturities of investments, consisting primarily of debt securities, were $409.4, $647.9 and $558.5 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities was $33.4, $611.7 and $73.2 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2000, we generated $376.6 from the issuance of common stock in the initial public offering of McDATA. In 2001, we distributed our ownership interest in McDATA. As a result of the distribution, McDATAs net assets are no longer consolidated with our assets, which resulted in a $142.0 reduction in cash. The majority of the remaining cash generated in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was from the exercise of stock options. In 2000, $665.4 of convertible debt was converted into our common stock. We employ several strategies to enhance our liquidity and income. We derive revenues from both selling and leasing activity. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any exposure that may exist. Additionally, from time to time we may sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial. We also lend certain fixed income securities to generate investment income. During 2001, we entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2001, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. We have available for use credit lines of $50.0 in the United States and $50.0 in Brazil. The Brazilian line requires us to borrow in Brazilian currency. As of December 31, 2001, we had $40.0 outstanding on our line of credit in Brazil and none outstanding on our line of credit in the United States. The Brazilian line of credit requires us to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses and maintaining minimum levels of cash and investments. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2001, we were in compliance with the covenants. The Brazilian line of credit has been established to help manage currency volatility between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and facilitate cash repatriation. In addition, throughout the world, we have bank guarantees and other bank facilities aggregating $32.1 for the purpose of guaranteeing rent, taxes, duties and other obligations. We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements. Off balance sheet arrangements are obligations that are not recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. Our off balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and purchase obligations for goods and services not yet received. The following represents our notes payable, long term debt and capital and operating leases as of December 31, 2001. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Notes payable and long term debt, including capital lease obligations $ 75.6 $ 58.0 $ 15.1 $ 0.3 $ 2.2 Operating leases 719.8 215.9 266.9 123.5 113.5 Total contractual obligations $ 795.4 $ 273.9 $ 282.0 $ 123.8 $ 115.7 At December 31, 2001, we also had outstanding purchase orders to purchase $847.0 of manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services in 2002 and, for certain items, thereafter. While purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. 20 Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that the combination of funds currently available, funds generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the next twelve months. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. Critical Accounting Policies EMCs significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. While all the accounting policies impact the financial statements, certain policies may be viewed to be critical. These policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition, asset valuation and accounting for income taxes. We derive revenue from information storage systems, software and services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, these criteria are met at the time of shipment, provided that no significant post delivery obligations remain. When significant post delivery obligations exist, revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. In sales contracts that include a combination of systems, software or services, we allocate revenue amongst the items and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on fair value and recognize the difference between the total contract fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. We accrue for systems warranty costs, sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment. Revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the net present value of expected future payments. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin, No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, FAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. As noted, we accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, the amount of actual warranty costs could differ from our estimates. Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, inventories, property, plant and equipment, investments, capitalized software and intangible and other assets. Asset valuation is governed by various accounting principles, including FAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of (to be superceded in 2002 by FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets), and Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, among others. Management uses a variety of factors to assess valuation depending upon the asset. For example, accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of customers, historical experience, an assessment of expected returns and current market and economic conditions. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, 21 competition and changes in technology. Property, plant and equipment, capitalized software and intangible and other assets are evaluated utilizing various factors, including the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Investments are evaluated for impairment based upon market conditions, the industry sectors in which the entity operates and the viability of each entity. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could impact the value of the asset. As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued FAS No. 141, Business Combinations and FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 supercedes Accounting Principles Bulletin No. 16, Business Combinations and FAS No. 38, Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. FAS 142 supercedes Accounting Principles Bulletin No. 17, Intangible Assets. These new statements require use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, thereby eliminating use of the pooling of interests method. Goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be tested for impairment under a two step process. Under the first step, an entitys net assets are broken down into reporting units and compared to their fair value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. In addition, within six months of adopting the accounting standard, a transitional impairment test must be completed, and any impairments identified must be treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Additionally, new criteria have been established that determine whether an acquired intangible asset should be recognized separately from goodwill. The statements are effective for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, with the entire provisions of FAS 141 and FAS 142 becoming effective for us commencing with our 2002 fiscal year. We have completed our transitional impairment test and concluded that there is no impairment to goodwill. As a result of adopting FAS 142, approximately $45.0 of goodwill amortization will not be recognized in 2002. In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143 Accounting for Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long Lived Assets. The provisions of FAS 143 apply to all entities that incur obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. FAS 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 and will become effective for us commencing with our 2003 fiscal year. This accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. In October 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. FAS 144 provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The objectives of FAS 144 are to address issues relating to the implementation of FAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and to develop a model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired. FAS 144 is effective for us commencing with our 2002 fiscal year. This accounting pronouncement could have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations should there be future asset impairments or disposals. 22 FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks. This Annual Report on Form 10 K also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. Our future results may differ materially from our current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to those set forth below, other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our business could continue to be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions. We are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions. Our operating results have been materially adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced information technology spending. If economic and market conditions do not improve, our business, results of operations or financial condition could continue to be materially adversely affected. Our business could continue to be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market. Our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for information storage systems, software and services, particularly in the product segments in which we compete. During 2001, there was a decrease in demand for information storage products as customers delayed or reduced information technology expenditures. Sales expected to occur in the last month and weeks and days of a quarter were cancelled or deferred until future quarters. There can be no assurance that such cancellations or deferrals will result in sales in the near term, or at all. For 2002, customer forecasts indicate that information technology budgets may be further reduced. Further delays or reductions in information technology spending, domestically or internationally, could continue to materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings. We may have difficulty managing operations. With the weakened global economy, we have experienced lower than expected revenues and, in the third quarter of 2001, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on the highest potential growth areas of our business. Our future operating results will depend on the success of our restructuring program as well as on our overall ability to manage operations, which includes, among other things: retaining and hiring, as required, the appropriate number of qualified employees enhancing and expanding, as appropriate, our infrastructure, including but not limited to, our information systems and management team accurately forecasting revenues managing inventory levels to minimize excess and obsolete inventory controlling expenses managing our manufacturing capacity, real estate facilities and other assets executing on our plans An unexpected further decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of operations could have a further material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 23 Competitive pricing and difficulty managing product costs could materially adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Competitive pricing pressures exist in the information storage market and have had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. There also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide information storage products or services, together with other products or services, at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share. We currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue. To date, we have been able to manage our component and product design costs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs. Further, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in product price and component cost could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 exacerbated global economic conditions and adversely impacted many businesses, including our business. Terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, customers, partners, suppliers and distributors and resellers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment, including receipt of components and distribution of products. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers. There can be no assurance that our existing products will continue to be properly positioned in the market or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis, or at all. We spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time. There can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products or new products will receive customer acceptance. Risks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage, networking and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products. Risks inherent in the transition to new products include the difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately, the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products, the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced, thereby causing an excessive obsolete supply of inventory, and delays in initial shipments of new products. Further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors, competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. If our suppliers do not meet our quality or delivery requirements, we could have decreased revenues and earnings. We purchase many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers, including some of our competitors. These components and products include disk drives, high density memory components and power supplies. We have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. If any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery 24 requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies. The importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies, along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales, intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet its quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. Our business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense in the high technology industry. Because of the importance of stock based incentive compensation in our total compensation program, the volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key or other employees, our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Historically uneven sales patterns could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and earnings. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarters total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter. This pattern makes prediction of revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. We believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including: the significant size of our average product price in relation to our customers budgets, resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval, which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first quarter of the following year seasonal influences Our uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there will be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, the ability to assemble, test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited, which could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings. In addition, our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. This is because: we assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers we generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty 25 Moreover, delays in product shipping, caused by loss of power or telecommunications or similar services, or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses, could intensify the impact of these factors on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition to our direct sales force, we have agreements in place with many distributors, systems integrators, resellers and OEMs to market and sell our products and services. We may, from time to time, derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated, if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, as our market opportunities change, we may have an increased reliance on channel partners, which may negatively impact gross margins. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and market share. Furthermore, the partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce the visibility to our management of potential customers and demand for products and services, thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand. In addition, there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop or market products or services in competition with us in the future. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments. As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business including, among other things: the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies the difficulty of integrating the acquired business the lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the potential impairment of acquired assets These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. To the extent that we issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase common stock in connection with any future acquisition, existing stockholders may experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share. We also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business. The markets we serve are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively. We compete with many established companies in the markets we serve and some of these companies may have substantially greater financial, marketing and technological resources, larger distribution capabilities, earlier access to customers and more opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than us. We also compete with many smaller, less established companies in specific product segments. Some of 26 these companies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us. Our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors, including hardware and software products and services, and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors. Changes in foreign conditions could impair our international sales. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, trade restrictions, import or export licensing requirements, the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries. Undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results. If flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products were to occur by us or our suppliers, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation. Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing, are critical factors in our future growth. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances. We have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies. Any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances, certain of which have substantially greater financial, marketing or technological resources than us, will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future, discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors. Our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property. We generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the United States and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. However, there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that, if obtainable, such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights. Responding to any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be 27 time consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party, and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us. In the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings. Such matters can be time consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. From time to time, we are subject to income tax audits. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed with additional taxes, there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition. Changes in regulations could materially adversely affect us. Our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us or our products were newly implemented or changed. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as: the announcement of new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community In addition, our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and has recently been negatively affected by unfavorable global economic conditions. If such conditions continue to deteriorate, our stock price could decline further. 28 ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenues and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, our exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and South East Asia, continues to increase as we further expand our presence in these markets. Despite the relative size of our exposure in these markets, the inherent volatility of these economies could negatively impact our financial results. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We use a combination of option and forward contracts to hedge our net asset and anticipated cash flow positions. The hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. We employ a variance/covariance model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of December 31, 2001. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $1.1 million as of December 31, 2001 and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2000. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2001 and 2000 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2001 $ 1.8 $ 2.2 $ 1.1 2000 2.1 2.9 1.2 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various issuers, types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are 29 recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). These instruments are not leveraged, and are not held for trading purposes. A portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk. We employ a variance/covariance model to calculate value at risk for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of December 31, 2001. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $9.3 million as of December 31, 2001 and $8.3 million as of December 31, 2000. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2001 and 2000 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2001 $ 10.6 $ 12.8 $ 9.3 2000 4.5 8.3 2.2 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, short and long term investments and trade and notes receivable. We place our temporary cash investments and short and long term investments in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one financial institution. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is minimal due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any exposure that may exist. 30
