ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS beginning on page 29. All dollar amounts in this MD&A are in millions, except per share amounts. The following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total revenues. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues Information storage systems 54.9 % 60.7 % 70.4 % Information storage software 22.7 22.0 16.2 Information storage services 19.8 13.7 6.9 Total information storage revenue 97.4 96.5 93.5 Other businesses 2.6 3.5 6.5 Total revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost and expenses Cost of sales 61.0 59.9 42.1 Research and development 14.4 13.1 8.8 Selling, general and administrative 30.9 31.2 23.7 Restructuring and other special charges 2.8 5.6 Operating income (loss) (9.1 ) (9.8 ) 25.4 Investment income, interest expense and other expense, net 3.6 1.7 2.1 Income (loss) before income taxes (5.5 ) (8.1 ) 27.5 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (3.3 ) (0.9 ) 7.4 Net income (loss) (2.2 )% (7.2 )% 20.1 % Revenues Total revenues were $5,438.4, $7,090.6 and $8,872.8 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing decreases of $1,652.2, or 23%, from 2001 to 2002, and $1,782.2, or 20%, from 2000 to 2001. Information storage systems revenues were $2,985.3, $4,307.2 and $6,245.8 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing decreases of $1,321.9, or 31%, from 2001 to 2002, and $1,938.6, or 31%, from 2000 to 2001. Both annual decreases were primarily due to declining sales volume and increased levels of competition. The global economic slowdown, which commenced in 2001 and continued throughout 2002, led to a reduction in information technology spending. Competitive pricing pressures also had an adverse effect on revenues. Information storage software revenues were $1,233.1, $1,560.0 and $1,435.1 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing a decrease of $326.9, or 21%, from 2001 to 2002, and an increase of $124.9, or 9%, from 2000 to 2001. The decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to declining sales volume caused 15 Table of Contents by the global economic slowdown and increased levels of competition. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to greater demand for storage software on both newly shipped and already installed systems and the successful introduction of new and enhanced software products. Continued negative trends in the economy, further reductions in information technology spending, increased levels of competition or continued pricing pressures may continue to negatively impact information storage systems and software revenues in 2003. Information storage services revenues were $1,078.4, $972.3 and $612.1 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of $106.1, or 11%, from 2001 to 2002, and $360.2, or 59%, from 2000 to 2001. The increases were primarily due to a greater volume of professional services, largely to support and implement automated networked storage solutions. Additionally, the increases were due to a growth in maintenance revenues associated with a greater number of both software and hardware maintenance contracts. Total information storage revenues were $5,296.8, $6,839.5 and $8,293.0 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing decreases of $1,542.7, or 23%, from 2001 to 2002, and $1,453.5, or 18%, from 2000 to 2001. Other businesses revenues were $141.6, $251.1 and $579.8 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing decreases of $109.5, or 44%, from 2001 to 2002, and $328.7, or 57%, from 2000 to 2001. Other businesses revenues consist of revenues from AViiON server products and related services. Included in the 2001 and 2000 amounts were revenues from AViiON server products of $48.4 and $286.1, respectively. In the third quarter of 2001, EMC stopped selling AViiON server products. Accordingly, other businesses revenues for the last quarter of 2001, all of 2002 and future years are and will be comprised only of AViiON services revenues. These revenues are expected to continue to decline in future years. Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $3,225.4, $4,185.4 and $5,436.2 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing decreases of $960.0, or 23%, from 2001 to 2002, and $1,250.8, or 23%, from 2000 to 2001. Revenues on sales into the European, Middle East and African markets were $1,327.8, $1,774.9 and $2,351.8 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing decreases of $447.1, or 25%, from 2001 to 2002, and $576.9, or 25%, from 2000 to 2001. Revenues on sales into the Asia Pacific markets were $769.8, $893.4 and $880.1 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing a decrease of $123.6, or 14%, from 2001 to 2002, and an increase of $13.3, or 2%, from 2000 to 2001. Revenues on sales into the Latin American markets were $115.4, $237.0 and $204.7 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing a decrease of $121.6, or 51%, from 2001 to 2002, and an increase of $32.3, or 16%, from 2000 to 2001. The decline in revenues in all markets in 2002 and in the North American and European, Middle East and African markets in 2001 was attributable to the global economic slowdown that began in 2001 and continued throughout 2002, which led to a reduction in information technology spending. Increased levels of competition, including competitive pricing pressures, also had an adverse effect on revenues. The decline in the Latin American markets in 2002 was further impacted by the regions political and currency instability. The increase in revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 in the Asia Pacific and the Latin American markets resulted from our efforts to expand our sales infrastructure throughout these regions to meet demand for information storage products and services. While revenues increased in these markets, the increases were lower than anticipated due to the aforementioned factors causing the decline in revenues in the other regions. The provision for sales returns was $158.6 in 2002, $635.9 in 2001 and $256.7 in 2000. At the time of sale, we provide for the potential returns of systems as a reduction of revenue. We estimate the amount of returns based upon our historical experience, specific identification of probable returns and current market and economic conditions. The decrease in the provision for sales returns in 2002 compared to 2001 was attributable to a decline in revenue and a reduction in the level of returns experienced in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in the provision for sales returns in 2001 compared to 2000 was attributable to an increase in the level of returns experienced in 2001 over 2000. In 2001, various segments of our customer base to which we sell both directly and indirectly, including telecommunication providers and Internet related businesses, experienced dramatic declines 16 Table of Contents in their respective businesses. As a consequence, we had a higher level of returns in 2001 compared to 2000. We therefore increased our provision for sales returns during 2001 as the economy and our customers businesses continued to deteriorate. Changes in exchange rates in 2002 compared to 2001 had a negligible effect on revenues. Changes in exchange rates in 2001 compared to 2000 negatively impacted revenues by approximately 3%. The impact was most significant in Japan, Brazil and Germany. Gross Margins Gross margin dollars decreased to $2,118.8 in 2002 from $2,843.6 in 2001, a decrease of $724.8, or 25%. Gross margin dollars decreased to $2,843.6 in 2001 from $5,143.1 in 2000, a decrease of $2,299.5, or 45%. Included in the 2001 and 2000 amounts is goodwill amortization of $42.3 and $40.0, respectively. As a result of implementing Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is no longer amortized. The declines in gross margin dollars in both 2002 and 2001 were primarily in the information storage products segment. Gross margin percentages for information storage products were 38.0%, 40.5% and 61.4% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gross margin percentage for 2001 was negatively impacted by $320.1, or 5.5%, for a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and impaired capitalized software. The gross margin percentage for 2002 was favorably impacted by $61.6, or 1.5%, resulting from a partial reduction of the 2001 provision for excess and obsolete inventory. The benefit resulted primarily from the sale of previously identified obsolete inventory for which a full reserve had been established. The annual declines in gross margin percentages in 2002 and 2001 were primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues resulting from lower sales volume, which caused fixed overhead costs to be absorbed over a lower sales base. In addition, lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing also contributed to the declines. Partially offsetting the declines were reductions in our fixed overhead costs resulting from measures we took to reduce costs, which were initiated in the second half of 2001. Additionally, the 2002 gross margin percentage was favorably impacted as a result of implementing FAS No. 142. The gross margin percentage for information storage services increased to 41.7% in 2002 compared to 38.4% in 2001 and 33.8% in 2000. The increases in the gross margin percentages were attributable to greater productivity of our customer service and professional services personnel. Gross margin percentages for other businesses were 46.1%, 36.8% and 37.8% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2002 resulted from this segment consisting only of services revenue in 2002 compared to both systems and services revenue in 2001. The decline in the gross margin percentage in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily caused by the discontinuance of the sale of AViiON server products in the third quarter of 2001. We anticipate that the overall gross margin percentage will improve in 2003 compared to 2002 as our volume of information storage systems and software sales increases. However, if sales volumes do not increase or competitive pricing pressures increase from those we experienced in 2002, gross margins may be negatively impacted in 2003. Research and Development Research and development (R&D) expenses were $781.5, $928.7 and $783.2 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. R&D expenses decreased 16% in 2002 compared to 2001, and increased 19% in 2001 compared to 2000. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 14.4%, 13.1% and 8.8% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In addition, we spent $126.7, $120.7 and $102.8 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, on software development, which costs were capitalized. R&D spending levels reflect our efforts to continue to improve our long term competitive position, offset in part by our continued cost cutting. R&D spending includes enhancements to information storage software and information storage systems, including networked information storage systems. We will continue with our R&D efforts in 2003; however, the overall level of spending is 17 Table of Contents expected to be slightly lower in 2003 compared to 2002 as we gain further efficiencies in our operating cost structure. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $1,680.8, $2,214.2 and $2,103.0 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SG&A expenses decreased 24% in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 5% in 2001 compared to 2000. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 30.9%, 31.2% and 23.7% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in SG&A in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to measures we took to reduce costs, which were initiated in the second half of 2001 and continued in 2002, enabling us to begin to achieve a cost structure commensurate with reduced revenue levels. Additionally, lower commission expense due to lower revenues reduced SG&A expenses. The increase in spending in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to efforts to expand sales and build an infrastructure to support an expected increased revenue base, partially offset by reductions implemented in the second half of 2001 to achieve a lower cost structure. The provision for bad debts was $35.2 in 2002, $32.7 in 2001 and $27.5 in 2000. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts and notes receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of our receivables and current market and economic conditions. The increases in the provision in 2002 compared to 2001 and 2001 compared to 2000 were each due to the general economic declines experienced worldwide. Restructuring and Other Special Charges Due to the declines in revenues experienced in 2002 and 2001, in each of those years, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on the highest potential growth areas of our business. In 2002 and 2001, we recognized restructuring and other special charges of $100.0 and $825.2, respectively. The 2002 charges consisted of $140.9 associated with the 2002 restructuring program, an $8.9 loss on assets disposed of within the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the 2002 restructuring program and $11.8 of additional restructuring costs associated with the 2001 restructuring program. Offsetting these costs in 2002 was a $61.6 reduction in the third quarter 2001 provision for excess and obsolete inventory. The 2001 charge consisted of a $310.0 provision for excess and obsolete inventory, $408.6 for restructuring activities and $106.6 for other than temporary declines in equity investments. The restructuring and other special charges have been classified within our statement of operations according to their related category. These categories are as follows: Restructuring Charge 2002 2001 Cost of sales $ (61.6 ) $ 320.1 Restructuring and other special charges 150.4 398.5 SG&A expenses 2.3 Other expense, net 8.9 106.6 Total $ 100.0 $ 825.2 The detail on each of the charges and activity for 2002 and 2001 is explained in the following sections. 2002 Restructuring Program In the fourth quarter of 2002, we implemented a restructuring program to further reduce our cost structure. As a result of the program, we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $140.9. The restructuring charges consisted of $44.5 for employee termination benefits, $58.0 to consolidate excess facilities, $21.5 related to the impairment of long lived assets and $16.9 for contractual and other obligations for which we will no longer derive an economic benefit. The 2002 restructuring program impacted all of our segments. 18 Table of Contents Worldwide Reduction in Force The 2002 restructuring program includes a reduction in force of approximately 1,500 employees across all business functions and geographic regions. Approximately 64% of such employees are or were based in North America and the remainder are or were based in Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax charge of $44.5 for termination benefits. As a result of labor laws in certain foreign countries in which we operate, the amount of termination benefits for employees in such countries was not determinable as of December 31, 2002. As these amounts are finalized, which is expected to be in the first quarter of 2003, we will recognize additional charges. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 1,000 employees had been terminated. Consolidation of Excess Facilities The 2002 restructuring program includes a pre tax charge of $58.0 for the consolidation of space within our corporate facilities and the elimination of excess field office space worldwide. Included in the charge are $52.9 for estimated losses on subleases and a $5.1 impairment charge for non recoverable leasehold improvements. Certain facilities were vacated in the fourth quarter of 2002, with the remainder to be vacated in the first half of 2003. As a result of our decision to vacate the premises earlier than the lease termination dates, we will accelerate the amortization of the related leasehold improvements over the remaining periods of occupancy. This will result in incremental amortization expense of $6.7 in the first half of 2003. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In the fourth quarter of 2002, we implemented a program to consolidate the locations of and made other modifications to our Internet hosting business. As a result, we recognized a pre tax charge of $17.9 relating to the impairment of long lived assets. The impairment charge is equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we placed for sale certain assets associated with a portion of our Data General services business. The expected proceeds from this sale were estimated to be less than the related assets carrying value, resulting in a pre tax charge of $3.6. The impaired assets are classified within our information storage services segment. Contractual and Other Obligations As a result of the 2002 restructuring program, various contractual obligations will no longer provide any economic benefit to us. These contractual obligations include marketing agreements, equipment leases, maintenance agreements and component part purchase obligations. Additionally, as a result of our restructuring activities, we have certain pending employment related claims. In light of the above factors, we recognized a pre tax charge of $16.9. A summary of the costs for the 2002 restructuring program is outlined as follows: Category Provision Current Utilization Ending Balance Non Cash Portion of the Provision Workforce reduction $ 44.5 $ (22.4 ) $ 22.1 $ Consolidation of excess facilities 58.0 (5.4 ) 52.6 5.1 Asset impairment 21.5 (21.5 ) 21.5 Contractual and other obligations 16.9 (1.6 ) 15.3 Total $ 140.9 $ (50.9 ) $ 90.0 $ 26.6 Loss on the Disposal of Assets As a result of the 2002 restructuring program, we disposed of certain fixed assets that were no longer essential to the operation of our business. As a result, we recognized a pre tax charge of $8.9 which is classified within other expense, net, in our statement of operations. 19 Table of Contents Impacts of the 2002 Restructuring Program The 2002 restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 2003, although the ability to sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions. The expected cash impact of the 2002 restructuring program is $114.3, of which $24.2 was paid in 2002. Remaining cash expenditures, relating to workforce reductions and contractual obligations, are expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2003. Amounts relating to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2015. As a result of the 2002 restructuring program, we expect to reduce costs in all areas of our operations, favorably impacting cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. The 2002 restructuring program, once fully implemented, is expected to reduce costs by approximately $130.0 per year. We began to realize a portion of the benefits in the fourth quarter of 2002. 2001 Restructuring Program In the third quarter of 2001, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure. As a result of the program, we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $825.2. The restructuring charges consisted of $111.5 for employee termination benefits, $104.5 related to the impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and other long lived assets, $158.1 to consolidate excess facilities and $34.5 for other contractual obligations for which we will no longer derive an economic benefit. The other special charges included a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $310.0 and an other than temporary decline in certain equity investments of $106.6. The amounts charged and adjusted against the provisions established in 2001 are as follows: 2002 Category Beginning Balance Adjustment to the Provision Current Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 48.2 $ 19.3 $ (67.5 ) $ Other contractual obligations 23.7 (7.3 ) (13.3 ) 3.1 Consolidation of excess facilities 127.4 (0.2 ) (29.9 ) 97.3 Total $ 199.3 $ 11.8 $ (110.7 ) $ 100.4 2001 Category Beginning Balance Provision Adjustment to the Provision Current Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ $ 111.5 $ (18.3 ) $ (45.0 ) $ 48.2 Impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and other long lived assets 104.5 (104.5 ) Other contractual obligations 34.5 (8.0 ) (2.8 ) 23.7 Consolidation of excess facilities 158.1 26.3 (57.0 ) 127.4 Total $ $ 408.6 $ $ (209.3 ) $ 199.3 The 2001 restructuring program included a reduction in force of approximately 4,000 employees across all business functions and geographic regions. As of June 30, 2002, all identified personnel had been terminated. The adjustment to the provision for workforce reduction in 2002 was primarily attributable to the finalization of severance payments associated with reductions in force in certain foreign jurisdictions. The adjustment to the provision for other contractual obligations in 2002 resulted from favorable settlements. The adjustment to the provision for the workforce reduction in 2001 primarily related to voluntary employee resignations. The adjustment to the provision for other contractual obligations in 2001 related primarily to a favorable settlement of an estimated liability for the closure of an information storage services business. The adjustment to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in 2001 primarily related to additional leased facilities being vacated. 20 Table of Contents 2001 Inventory Provision The amounts charged and adjusted against the 2001 established provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are set forth below. The activity is reflected within cost of sales in our statement of operations. Beginning Balance Inventory Scrapped and Charged Against the Reserve Reduction in Cost of Sales Ending Balance 2002 Category Inventory Sold Favorable Vendor Settlements Excess and obsolete EMC ownedinventory $ 226.2 $ (182.9 ) $ (37.0 ) $ $ 6.3 Excess and obsolete purchaseobligations 29.3 (4.8 ) (20.9 ) (3.6 ) Total $ 255.5 $ (187.7 ) $ (57.9 ) $ (3.6 ) $ 6.3 Beginning Balance Current Year Provision Inventory Scrapped and Charged Against the Reserve Reduction in Cost of Sales Ending Balance 2001 Category Inventory Sold Favorable Vendor Settlements Excess and obsolete EMC ownedinventory $ $ 280.5 $ (54.3 ) $ $ $ 226.2 Excess and obsolete purchaseobligations 29.5 (0.2 ) 29.3 Total $ $ 310.0 $ (54.5 ) $ $ $ 255.5 Other Charges In 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of $106.6 for other than temporary declines in equity investments. These investments are in privately held companies, primarily in the storage industry, many of which are in the start up or development stage. These investments are carried at cost, subject to adjustment for impairment. Due to the continued global economic slowdown in 2001, as well as the downturn in the storage industry, we determined that the decline in these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss. Impacts of the 2001 Restructuring Program The 2001 restructuring program has been substantially completed, although our ability to sell and sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions. The expected cash impact of the charge is $266.5, of which $55.4 was paid in 2001 and $110.7 was paid in 2002. The remaining accrual balance primarily relates to the consolidation of facilities that will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2015. Cost Savings from the Restructuring Programs Both the 2002 and 2001 restructuring programs have reduced costs in all areas of our operations, favorably impacting cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. As of December 31, 2002, the annualized costs savings, compared to the cost structure in place as of the end of the second quarter of 2001, is in excess of $1,250.0. Investment Income and Interest Expense Investment income was $256.2, $265.3 and $206.2 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents, short and long term investments and sales 21 Table of Contents type leases. Investment income decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 because of lower yields on outstanding investment balances, partially offset by greater realized gains on the sale of investments. Investment income increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to greater realized gains on the sale of investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains, was 3.5%, 4.8% and 5.8% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest expense was $11.4 in 2002, $11.3 in 2001 and $14.6 in 2000. The decrease in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the conversion of our 3 % convertible subordinated notes due 2002 in March 2000 and our 6% convertible subordinated notes due 2004 in May 2000. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $47.4, $133.1 and $7.3 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2002 amount was comprised primarily of losses on the disposal of assets totaling $34.1. Included in the 2001 amount was a $106.6 non cash charge for other than temporary declines in equity investments. These investments were carried at cost, subject to impairment. Due to the continued global economic slowdown in 2001, as well as the downturn in the storage industry, we determined that the decline in value of these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss. Provision for Income Taxes In 2002 and 2001, we reported pre tax losses resulting in income tax benefits of $177.8 and $69.3, respectively. In 2000, we reported pre tax income resulting in a provision for income taxes of $659.1. The rates of benefit were 60.0% in 2002 compared to 12.0% in 2001. In 2000, the effective income tax rate was 27.0%. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income (loss) for the year, the composition of the income (loss) in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of tax audits. For 2002, the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the overall favorable resolution of international tax matters, which aggregated $67.7. Such amount included the favorable resolution of an international tax audit, partially offset by a provision for tax liabilities on other international tax matters. Additionally, a reduction in the valuation allowance resulting from the realization of capital loss carryforwards contributed to the favorable rate. For 2001, the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate due to the mix of income and losses in foreign countries and the establishment of provisions associated with the impact of foreign tax audits, partially offset by a $133.2 tax benefit realized from a prior acquisition. For 2000, the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate due to our global tax strategy and the effect of our European manufacturing operations. The valuation allowance decreased by $31.1 in 2002 and $25.4 in 2001. The valuation allowance increased by $0.3 in 2000. The decreases in the valuation allowance in 2002 and 2001 were attributable to the realization of capital loss carryforwards. Additionally, we liquidated certain foreign subsidiaries, resulting in the loss of their net operating loss carryforwards that had been fully offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the liquidations, both the deferred tax assets associated with the operating loss carryforwards and the related valuation allowance were reversed. Partially offsetting these decreases in the valuation allowance were increases resulting from the generation of additional foreign loss carryforwards. We expect the effective income tax rate for 2003 to be approximately 30%; however, the rate may vary depending upon the actual operating results for the year, the composition of the income (loss) in different countries and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of tax audits. Financial Condition Cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were $5,685.6 and $5,083.6 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $602.0. In 2002, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $442.4 and short and long term investments increased by $1,044.4. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,445.7 in 2002 compared to $1,631.3 in 2001 and $2,108.7 in 2000. The decline in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily attributable to a lower level of cash generated from 22 Table of Contents working capital in 2002 compared to 2001. The 2002 reduction in working capital was primarily driven by a reduction in cash generated from collecting accounts and notes receivable due to lower revenue levels in 2002 compared to 2001. Partially offsetting this reduction were increases in deferred revenue attributable to increased sales of software maintenance contracts. The decline in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily attributable to the $507.7 loss incurred in the year. Offsetting the loss was an overall improvement in cash generated from working capital associated with substantial reductions in accounts and notes receivable and inventories. Cash used for investing activities was $1,576.4, $1,513.6 and $1,842.4 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capital additions were $391.1, $889.3 and $858.4 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in capital additions in 2002 compared to 2001 resulted from measures we took to reduce costs, which were initiated in the second half of 2001. Capitalized software development costs were $126.7, $120.7 and $102.8 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net purchases and maturities of investments, consisting of debt securities, were $1,011.6, $409.4 and $647.9 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We expect our capital additions for 2003 to be approximately the same to slightly down compared with the $391.1 spent in 2002. Cash used for financing activities was $311.2 in 2002 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $33.4 and $611.7 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, we repurchased 49.5 million shares of our common stock, par value $.01 per share (Common Stock), at a cost of $363.9. As of December 31, 2002, we had repurchased 50.6 million shares of the 300.0 million shares of Common Stock authorized for repurchase by our Board of Directors. From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b 5 1 plans to facilitate our share repurchases. In 2000, we generated $376.6 from the issuance of common stock in the initial public offering of McDATA Corporation (McDATA). In 2001, we distributed our ownership interest in McDATA. As a result of the distribution, McDATAs net assets are no longer consolidated with our assets, which resulted in a $142.0 reduction in cash. The majority of the remaining cash generated in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was from the exercise of stock options. In 2000, $665.4 of convertible debt was converted into our Common Stock. We have available for use credit lines of $50.0 in the United States and $50.0 in Brazil. The Brazilian line of credit has been established to help manage currency volatility between the local currency and the U.S. dollar. The Brazilian line requires us to borrow in Brazilian currency. As of December 31, 2002, we had $11.0 outstanding on our line of credit in Brazil and none outstanding on our line of credit in the United States. The Brazilian line of credit requires us to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses and maintaining minimum levels of cash and investments. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2002, we were in compliance with the covenants. We lend certain fixed income securities to generate investment income. During 2002, we entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2002, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that the combination of funds currently available, funds generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the next twelve months. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. 23 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Capital leases $ 8.3 $ 7.3 $ 1.0 $ $ Operating leases 545.1 186.3 192.7 87.6 78.5 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations 185.6 128.2 12.3 1.6 43.5 Purchase orders 830.8 775.9 54.9 Total $ 1,569.8 $ 1,097.7 $ 260.9 $ 89.2 $ 122.0 Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The other long term obligations, including notes payable and the current portion of long term obligations, consist primarily of $151.9 of obligations associated with the Data General pension and post retirement medical and life insurance plans. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $38.0 as of December 31, 2002. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. We have also agreed to guarantee our Brazilian subsidiarys $50.0 line of credit. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent or copyright. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for certain matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in EMC products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under certain of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to EMCs acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. We have agreements with each of our directors and executive officers to indemnify such director or executive officer, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with 24 Table of Contents any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer of EMC. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. In connection with certain dispositions, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain matters, such as breaches of representations and warranties. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2002, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2002 is immaterial. Notes and Accounts Receivable We derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. From time to time, we may also sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial. Litigation In April 2002, EMC filed a complaint against Hitachi with the ITC and in the United States Federal District Court in Worcester, Massachusetts. The ITC complaint alleged that Hitachi had engaged in unlawful activities by importing into the United States products that infringed six EMC patents. We asked the ITC to issue an injunction to block importation of Hitachis infringing products and in May 2002, the ITC voted to commence an investigation into our claims. The suit in District Court seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. In June 2002, the suit in District Court was stayed, pending the outcome of the ITC action. Subsequent to the date we filed a complaint against Hitachi, in April 2002, Hitachi and HICAM filed a complaint against us in the United States Federal District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging that certain of our products infringe eight Hitachi patents and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. In July 2002, this suit was transferred to the United States Federal District Court in Worcester, Massachusetts. In March 2003, EMC and Hitachi jointly announced that the parties had entered into agreements whereby they agreed (i) to settle all pending patent infringement claims between EMC, Hitachi and HICAM, (ii) to cross license their respective patents and (iii) to a framework for exchanging technology in the form of storage related APIs. In accordance with the cross license agreements, we will receive payments from Hitachi. The cross license agreements expire at the end of 2007. On February 27, 2003, EMC and Hitachi filed a Joint Motion with the ITC to terminate the ITC investigation on the basis of the above referenced agreements, and on March 11, 2003, the ITC judge signed an order terminating the ITC investigation. The parties intend to move to dismiss the district court actions referenced above once the ITC judges order has been accepted by the ITC. On September 30, 2002, EMC filed a complaint against HP in the United States Federal District Court in Worcester, Massachusetts alleging that certain HP products infringe six EMC patents. The suit seeks a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. On September 30, 2002, HP filed a complaint against us in the United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe seven HP patents. The suit seeks a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. We believe that HPs claims are without merit, and on October 1, 2002, we filed an amended complaint asking the court to declare that the seven HP patents are invalid and not infringed. We are a party to other litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 25 Table of Contents Pension and Post Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plans EMC has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the United States. Certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. Substantially all of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for these defined benefit plans are invested primarily in common stock, bonds and cash equivalent securities. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 8.4%. This rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2002. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2002 was 7.9%. In order to reflect current capital market projections, the expected long term rate of return for the 2003 plans expense has been reduced to 7.8%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately an $0.8 impact on the 2003 pension expense. As of December 31, 2002, the pension plans had a $146.0 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. At December 31, 2002, the discount rate was 6.4%. This rate represents the average of the discount rates for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by plan liabilities as of December 31, 2002. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For the U.S. plan, this rate is based on Moodys AA Corporate Bond Index. For international plans, the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.7 impact on the 2003 pension expense for all plans (international and U.S.). EMC also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the Data General acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. The plans assets are invested primarily in common stock, bonds and cash equivalent securities. The market related value of the plans assets is equal to the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on the plans assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 9.0%. In order to reflect current capital market assumptions, the expected long term rate of return for 2003 has been reduced to 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense. As of December 31, 2002, the plan had a $0.2 unrecognized actuarial gain that will be recognized over anticipated remaining years of service for participants. At December 31, 2002, the discount rate was 6.5%. The discount rate is based on Moodys AA Corporate Bond Index. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense. As a result of the changes in the expected long term rates of return and discount rate, our pension and post retirement medical and life insurance obligation increased from $77.2 at December 31, 2001 to $151.9 at December 31, 2002. In January 2003, we funded an additional $107.4 into the U.S. pension plan. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. EMCs significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin, No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements; Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software 26 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition; FAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists; FAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases; and SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and current market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, inventories and intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Restructuring Charges We have recognized restructuring charges in 2002 and 2001. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated losses on the sale of real estate, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions and negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued FAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. FAS No. 146 provides guidance on the accounting for 27 Table of Contents recognizing, measuring and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities. The pronouncement nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. Under EITF 94 3, a liability is recognized solely upon an entitys commitment to a plan. FAS No. 146 adjusts the timing of when a liability for termination benefits is to be recognized based upon whether the employee is required to render future service. A liability for costs to terminate an operating lease or other contract before the end of its term is to be recognized when the entity terminates the contract or ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. All other costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are to be expensed as incurred. FAS No. 146 requires the liability to be measured at its fair value with subsequent changes in fair value to be recognized each reporting period utilizing an interest allocation approach. The pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. We adopted FAS No. 146 effective January 1, 2003, and we do not expect that the pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on issue 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 addresses revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time, defining criteria that must be met for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of accounting. If an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting, the revenue for the element is recognized at the time of delivery. We do not expect that the pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (the Interpretation). This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We do not expect that this Interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. FAS No. 148 amends FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, FAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. As provided for in FAS No. 123, we have elected to apply Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans. APB No. 25 does not require options to be expensed when granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value. We intend to continue to apply the provisions of APB No. 25. See Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. A variable interest entity often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. Variable interest entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures. This Interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. We do not expect that this Interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 28 Table of Contents FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks. This Annual Report on Form 10 K also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. Our future results may differ materially from our current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to those set forth below, other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. Our business could continue to be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions. We are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions. Our operating results have been materially adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced information technology spending. If economic and market conditions do not improve, our business, results of operations or financial condition could continue to be materially adversely affected. Our business could continue to be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market. Our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for information storage systems, software and services, particularly in the product segments in which we compete. During 2001 and 2002, we experienced a decrease in demand for information storage products as customers delayed or reduced their information technology expenditures. Further delays or reductions in information technology spending, domestically or internationally, could continue to materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers. There can be no assurance that our existing products will continue to be properly positioned in the market or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis, or at all. We spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time. There can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products or new products will receive customer acceptance. As competition in the storage industry increases, it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits. Risks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage, networking and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products. Risks inherent in the transition to new products include the difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately, the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products, the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced, thereby causing a decline in sales of existing products and an excessive obsolete supply of inventory, and delays in initial shipments of new products. Further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors, competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The markets we serve are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively. We compete with many established companies in the markets we serve and some of these companies (whether independently or by establishing alliances) may have substantially greater financial, marketing and 29 Table of Contents technological resources, larger distribution capabilities, earlier access to customers and greater opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than us. We also compete with many smaller, less established companies who may be able to focus more effectively on specific product segments or markets. Historically, we have competed primarily on the basis of our products features and performance. As product pricing becomes a more important criteria for our customers, we may experience increased competition from certain low price competitors. Companies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us. Our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products, including hardware and software products, and services by our competitors, and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors. In addition, as we increase our software and services businesses, we may face new competitive challenges. We may have difficulty managing operations. In October 2002, we announced a restructuring program to further reduce our cost structure. The restructuring program included a reduction in force of approximately 1,500 employees and the closure of certain facilities. Our future operating results will depend on the success of this restructuring program as well as on our overall ability to manage operations, which includes, among other things: managing our business with fewer employees retaining and hiring, as required, the appropriate number of qualified employees enhancing, as appropriate, our infrastructure, including but not limited to, our information systems accurately forecasting revenues transitioning our sales force to sell more software and services managing inventory levels, including minimizing excess and obsolete inventory, while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet customer demands controlling expenses managing our manufacturing capacity, real estate facilities and other assets executing on our plans An unexpected further decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of our operations could have a further material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Competitive pricing and difficulty managing product costs could materially adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Competitive pricing pressures exist in the information storage market and have had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. There also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide information storage products or services, together with other products or services, at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share. We currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue. To date, we have been able to manage our component and product design costs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs. Further, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in product price and component cost could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 30 Table of Contents If our suppliers are not able to meet our requirements, we could have decreased revenues and earnings. We purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers, including some of our competitors. These components and products include disk drives, high density memory components, power supplies and software developed and maintained by third parties. We have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time sensitive customer orders, be unable to develop or sell certain products cost effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies. The importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies, along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales, intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet our quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism. Terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, customers, partners, suppliers and distributors and resellers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment, including receipt of components and distribution of products. Our business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key or other employees, our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Historically uneven sales patterns could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and earnings. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarters total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter. This pattern makes prediction of revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. We believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including: the significant size of our average product price in relation to our customers budgets, resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval, which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first quarter of the following year seasonal influences Our uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there will be excess 31 Table of Contents inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, the ability to assemble, test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited, which could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings. In addition, our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. This is because: we assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers we generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty Moreover, delays in product shipping, caused by loss of power or telecommunications or similar services, or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses, could intensify the impact of these factors on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition to our direct sales force, we have agreements in place with many distributors, systems integrators, resellers and original equipment manufacturers to market and sell our products and services. We may, from time to time, derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated, if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, as our market opportunities change, we may have an increased reliance on channel partners, which may negatively impact our gross margins. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and market share. Furthermore, the partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce the visibility to our management of potential customers and demand for products and services, thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand. In addition, there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop or market products or services in competition with us in the future. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments. As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business including, among other things: the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies the difficulty of integrating the acquired business the lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the potential impairment of acquired assets These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. To the extent that we issue shares of our Common Stock or other rights to purchase Common Stock in 32 Table of Contents connection with any future acquisition, existing stockholders may experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share. We also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business. Changes in foreign conditions could impair our international sales. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, trade restrictions, import or export licensing requirements, the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries. Undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results. If flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair, replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation. Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances. We have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies. Any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances, certain of which have substantially greater financial, marketing or technological resources than us, will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future, discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors. Our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property. We generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the United States and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. However, there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that, if obtainable, such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost. 33 Table of Contents From time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights. Responding to any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party, and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us. In the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings. Such matters can be time consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. From time to time, we are subject to income tax audits. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed with additional taxes, there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition. Changes in regulations could materially adversely affect us. Our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us or our products are newly implemented or changed. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as: the announcement of new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community In addition, our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and has been negatively affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions. If such conditions continue to deteriorate, our stock price could decline further. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and South East Asia. Despite the relatively small size of our exposure in these markets, the inherent volatility of these economies could negatively impact our financial results. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We employ a variance/covariance model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of December 31, 2002. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $0.3 million as of December 31, 2002 and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2001. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2002 and 2001 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2002 $ 0.4 $ 0.6 $ 0.3 2001 1.8 2.2 1.1 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive 35 Table of Contents income (loss). These instruments are not leveraged, and are not held for trading purposes. A portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk. We employ a variance/covariance model to calculate value at risk for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of December 31, 2002. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $5.5 million as of December 31, 2002 and $9.3 million as of December 31, 2001. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2002 and 2001 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2002 $ 7.3 $ 8.2 $ 5.5 2001 10.6 12.8 9.3 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, short and long term investments and trade and notes receivable. We place our temporary cash investments and short and long term investments in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment in any one issuer. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is minimal due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. 36 Table of Contents
