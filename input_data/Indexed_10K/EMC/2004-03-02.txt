ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS" beginning on page 40. The forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be completed after the date hereof. All dollar amounts in this MD&A are in millions, except per share amounts. INTRODUCTION We generate revenue through the sale, license and lease of products and services for information lifecycle management. The demand for our products is correlated, in general, to the worldwide economy, and more specifically, to the demand for IT infrastructure. We experienced a decline in demand for our products and services in 2001 and 2002 compared to the late 1990s and 2000. Commencing in 2001, we began to implement programs to reduce costs and to focus our efforts on areas we considered strategic in order to return to profitability. As a result of various initiatives, as well as an increase in demand for IT infrastructure, we returned to profitability in 2003. Our financial objective is to achieve profitable growth. Management believes that by providing a combination of systems, software and services to meet customers demand for information lifecycle management, we will be able to further increase revenues and profitability. In 2003, our operating income was 6.4% of revenue. We believe that by increasing revenues and further controlling costs, we will be able to improve operating income as a percentage of revenue. Our efforts in 2004 will be primarily focused on expanding our portfolio of offerings to satisfy our customers information lifecycle management requirements. This will include additional investments in research and development and the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, with a goal of increasing our market share. We will focus on improving our gross margins through a combination of providing a more profitable mix of systems, software and services and further leveraging our existing fixed cost component of cost of sales. Additionally, we will further integrate the operations of LEGATO, Documentum and VMware into EMC to streamline operations and reduce costs. COMPARISON OF FISCAL 2003 AND 2002 The following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total revenues. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost and expenses Cost of sales 54.4 61.0 Research and development 11.5 14.4 Selling, general and administrative 26.6 30.9 Restructuring and other special charges 1.1 2.8 Operating income (loss) 6.4 (9.1 ) Investment income, interest expense and other expense, net 2.7 3.6 Income (loss) before income taxes 9.2 (5.5 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 1.2 (3.3 ) Net income (loss) 8.0 % (2.2 )% 18 Revenues The following table presents revenue by our segments: 2003 2002 $ Change % Change Information storage products $ 4,658.3 $ 4,218.4 $ 439.9 10 % Information storage services 1,371.0 1,078.4 292.6 27 Documentum products and services 30.7 30.7 LEGATO products and services 77.3 77.3 Other businesses 99.5 141.6 (42.1 ) 30 Total revenues $ 6,236.8 $ 5,438.4 $ 798.4 15 % Information storage products revenues include information storage systems and information storage software revenues. Information storage systems revenues were $3,314.7 and $2,985.3 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing an increase of $329.4, or 11%. The increase was due to greater demand for these products attributable to a broadened product portfolio as well as increased demand throughout the year for IT infrastructure, partially offset by price declines. Information storage software revenues were $1,343.6 and $1,233.1 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing an increase of $110.5, or 9%. Information storage software revenue includes platform based software revenue and multi platform storage management and infrastructure software revenue. The increase in information storage software revenue was attributable to an expanded product offering and greater demand for software to manage increasingly complex networked storage environments. Information storage services revenues increased due to increased demand for software and hardware maintenance contracts. Additionally, increased demand for professional services, largely to support and implement automated networked storage solutions, contributed to the increase. Software and hardware maintenance accounted for 54.4% of total information storage services revenues in 2003 compared to 50.0% in 2002. Professional services accounted for 45.6% of total information storage services revenues in 2003 compared to 50.0% in 2002. Our Documentum and LEGATO products and services segments were established as a result of the acquisitions of LEGATO in October 2003 and Documentum in December 2003. Documentum provides enterprise content management software, enabling organizations to organize and manage unstructured data. From the date of acquisition (December 19, 2003) to December 31, 2003, Documentum product and services revenues were $30.7. LEGATO develops, markets and supports software products and services for information protection and recovery, hierarchal storage management, automated availability, e mail and content management. From the date of acquisition (October 21, 2003) to December 31, 2003, LEGATO product and services revenues were $77.3. Other businesses revenues consist of revenues from AViiON maintenance services. These revenues are expected to continue to decline in future years as we have discontinued selling AViiON servers. Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $3,740.7 and $3,225.4 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing an increase of $515.3, or 16%. Revenues on sales into the European, Middle East and African markets were $1,645.1 and $1,327.8 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing an increase of $317.3, or 24%. Revenues on sales into the Asia Pacific markets were $709.4 and $769.8 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing a decrease of $60.4, or 8%. Revenues on sales into the Latin American markets were $141.7 and $115.4 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing an increase of $26.3, or 23%. The increase in revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 in the North American, European, Middle East, African and Latin American markets was attributable to greater demand for our products and services. Also contributing to the increase were new and enhanced distribution channels in all markets, 19 broadened product offerings, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the acquisitions of Documentum and LEGATO. The decrease in revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 in the Asia Pacific markets was due to several large non recurring customer orders received in 2002. Changes in exchange rates in 2003 compared to 2002 positively impacted revenues by approximately 3.7%. The impact was most significant in the European market, primarily Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. At the time of sale, we provide for the potential returns of products as a reduction of revenue. We estimate the amount of returns based upon our historical experience, specific identification of probable returns and current market and economic conditions. In 2003, we reduced our provision for potential sales returns resulting in a benefit of $19.4. Our provision for sales returns was $158.6 in 2002. The decrease in the provision for sales returns in 2003 compared to 2002 was attributable to improved economic conditions, a reduction in the level of actual returns and lower than expected sales returns for 2003 compared to 2002. We expect revenues for 2004 to slightly exceed $7,800; however, our revenues could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy, demand for IT infrastructure and competitive factors. Costs and expenses The following table presents our costs and expenses and net income (loss). Certain columns may not add due to rounding. 2003 2002 $ Change % Change Cost of revenue: Information storage products $ 2,656.2 $ 2,614.1 $ 42.1 2 % Information storage services 671.0 629.1 41.9 7 Documentum products and services 4.3 4.3 * LEGATO products and services 17.3 17.3 * Other businesses 46.0 76.3 (30.3 ) 40 Total cost of revenue 3,394.8 3,319.5 75.3 2 % Gross margins: Information storage products 2,002.1 1,604.3 397.8 25 % Information storage services 700.0 449.3 250.7 56 Documentum products and services 26.4 26.4 * LEGATO products and services 60.0 60.0 * Other businesses 53.5 65.3 (11.8 ) 18 Total gross margin 2,842.1 2,118.8 723.3 34 % Operating expenses: Research and development 718.5 781.5 (63.0 ) 8 Selling, general and administrative 1,656.2 1,680.8 (24.6 ) 2 Restructuring and other special charges 66.3 150.4 (84.1 ) 56 Total operating expenses 2,440.9 2,612.7 (171.7 ) 7 Operating income (loss) 401.2 (493.8 ) 895.0 * Investment income, interest expense and other expenses, net 169.9 197.3 (27.4 ) 14 Income (loss) before income taxes 571.0 (296.5 ) 867.5 * Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 74.9 (177.8 ) 252.7 * Net income (loss) $ 496.1 $ (118.7 ) $ 614.8 * * Not Measurable 20 Gross Margins Information storage products gross margins were 43.0% and 38.0% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2003 compared to 2002 was attributable to increased sales volume and a lower fixed cost component of cost of sales due to cost reduction effects. The gross margin percentage for 2002 was favorably impacted by $61.6, or 1.5%, resulting primarily from the sale of previously identified obsolete inventory for which a reserve was established in 2001. The gross margin percentage for information storage services increased to 51.1% in 2003 compared to 41.7% in 2002. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to a greater proportion of revenues derived from the sale of software and hardware maintenance contracts compared to professional services revenues. Maintenance revenues provide a higher margin than professional services revenues. The gross margin percentage for the Documentum products and services segment was 86.1% in 2003. As a result of this acquisition closing near the end of December 2003, the mix of products and services revenue was not representative of its revenue mix for an entire fiscal year. We expect this segment to achieve gross margins of approximately 70.0% in 2004; however, the percentage will be impacted by the mix of software licenses versus services revenues. The gross margin percentage for the LEGATO products and services segment was 77.7% in 2003. We expect this segment to achieve comparable margins in 2004; however, the percentage will be impacted by the mix of software licenses versus services revenues. The gross margin percentages for other businesses were 53.7% and 46.1% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2003 compared to 2002 resulted from reducing costs in this segment as the volume of maintenance contracts diminished. Our overall gross margin percentage was 45.6% in 2003 compared to 39.0% in 2002. We anticipate our overall gross margin percentage will improve in 2004 compared to 2003, expecting it to slightly exceed 50% at some point prior to the fourth quarter of 2004. However, if sales volumes do not increase, software revenue as a percent of total revenue does not increase or competitive pricing pressures increase, gross margins may be negatively impacted in 2004. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, research and development ("R&D") expenses were 11.5% and 14.4% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, we spent $113.4 and $126.7 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, on software development, which costs were capitalized. The decline in R&D expenses was attributable to our cost cutting initiatives. R&D spending includes enhancements to our software and information storage systems. We expect the amount of R&D spending to be higher in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the R&D spending of LEGATO, Documentum and VMware. For 2004, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenues, to be approximately 12.0%. This percentage may vary, however, depending primarily on our 2004 revenues. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 26.6% and 30.9% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in the percentage was primarily attributable to increased revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to savings associated with our cost cutting initiatives and a reduction in bad debt expense. Partially offsetting these declines were additional costs incurred from the LEGATO and Documentum acquisitions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts and notes receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of our receivables and current market and economic conditions. The provision for bad debts was $1.8 in 2003 and $35.2 in 2002. The decrease 21 in the provision in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to the improvement in our collection experience and expected collection rate of our outstanding accounts and notes receivable balance. Our quarterly average days sales outstanding decreased from 63 days in 2002 to 47 days in 2003. We expect the overall level of SG&A spending to be higher in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the increased salary and related costs associated with LEGATO, Documentum and VMware. For 2004, we expect SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the mid 20% range. This percentage may vary, however, depending primarily on our 2004 revenues. Restructuring and Other Special Charges During 2003, we recorded restructuring and other special charges, primarily related to the acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum. In 2002, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on the highest potential growth areas of our business. The restructuring and other special charges were $66.3 and $100.0 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2003 charge consisted of $61.1, associated primarily with the acquisitions consummated in the year and $35.0 of additional restructuring costs associated with the 2002 restructuring program. Partially offsetting these costs in 2003 was a $29.8 reduction in accruals from prior restructuring programs. The reductions resulted from managements decision to utilize a facility for Documentum, LEGATO and certain of our other operations that we had previously vacated. Additionally, we favorably resolved a previously recognized contractual obligation. The 2002 charges consisted of $149.8 associated with the 2002 restructuring program and $11.8 of additional restructuring costs associated with our 2001 restructuring program. Offsetting these costs in 2002 was a $61.6 benefit resulting primarily from the sale of previously identified obsolete inventory for which a reserve was established in 2001. The restructuring and other special charges have been classified within our statement of operations according to their related category. These categories are as follows: 2003 2002 Cost of sales $ $ (61.6 ) Restructuring and other special charges 66.3 150.4 SG&A expenses 2.3 Other expense, net 8.9 Total $ 66.3 $ 100.0 The detail on each of the charges and activity for 2003 and 2002 is explained in the following sections. 2003 Restructuring Program In 2003, we recognized restructuring and other special charges of $61.1, primarily relating to the acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum. Included in the charges are employee termination benefits, write off of a duplicative software project and consolidation of excess facilities, which aggregated $31.9. The 2003 restructuring program impacted our information storage products and information storage services segments. The expected cash impact of the charge is $20.8, of which $3.9 was paid in 2003. The restructuring and other special charges also included in process R&D ("IPR&D") charges of $19.6 and $9.5 associated with the acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum, respectively. 22 The amounts charged against the provision established in 2003 are as follows: 2003 Category Initial Provision Utilization During 2003 Ending Balance Non Cash Portion of the Provision Workforce reduction $ 18.6 $ (3.9 ) $ 14.7 $ Asset impairment 10.5 (10.5 ) 10.5 Elimination of excess facilities 2.8 (0.5 ) 2.3 0.6 Total $ 31.9 $ (14.9 ) $ 17.0 $ 11.1 Worldwide Reduction in Force. The 2003 restructuring program included a reduction in force of approximately 200 employees across our major business functions and all major geographic regions. Approximately 48% of such employees were based in North America and the remainder are or were based in Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 125 employees had been terminated. Asset impairment. As a result of the LEGATO acquisition, we recognized an impairment charge of $10.5 for a duplicative EMC software project. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded the present value of its estimated discounted cash flows. The impaired asset is classified within our information storage products segment. Elimination of excess facilities. The 2003 restructuring program included a charge of $2.8 for the elimination of excess office space in the United Kingdom. 2002 Restructuring Program In the fourth quarter of 2002, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure. As a result of the program, we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $140.9. The restructuring charge included employee termination benefits, consolidation of excess facilities, impairment of long lived assets and contractual and other obligations for which we no longer derive an economic benefit. In addition, we recognized a charge of $8.9 related to disposal of certain fixed assets which is classified within other expense, net, in our statement of operations. The amounts charged and adjusted against the provisions established in 2002 are as follows: 2003 Category Beginning Balance Additions to the Provision During 2003 Utilization During 2003 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 22.1 $ 24.1 $ (39.6 ) $ 6.6 Consolidation of excess facilities 52.6 6.1 (21.5 ) 37.2 Contractual and other obligations 15.3 1.3 (11.7 ) 4.9 Total $ 90.0 $ 31.5 $ (72.8 ) $ 48.7 2002 Category Initial Provision Utilization During 2002 Ending Balance Non Cash Portion of the Provision Workforce reduction $ 44.5 $ (22.4 ) $ 22.1 $ Consolidation of excess facilities 58.0 (5.4 ) 52.6 5.1 Asset impairment 21.5 (21.5 ) 21.5 Contractual and other obligations 16.9 (1.6 ) 15.3 Total $ 140.9 $ (50.9 ) $ 90.0 $ 26.6 23 The $24.1 addition to the provision in 2003 for workforce reduction was primarily attributable to finalizing severance packages for employees in foreign jurisdictions. The $6.1 addition to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities represents the charges for facilities being vacated, offset by the reversal of reserves related to the reactivation of a facility that had previously been vacated. The $1.3 addition to the provision for contractual and other obligations represents incremental costs associated with previously established obligations. 2001 Restructuring Program In the third quarter of 2001, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure. As a result of the program, we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $825.1. The restructuring charges consisted of $111.5 for employee termination benefits, $104.5 related to the impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and other long lived assets, $158.1 to consolidate excess facilities and $34.5 for other contractual obligations for which we will no longer derive an economic benefit. The other special charges included a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $310.0 and an other than temporary decline in certain equity investments of $106.6. The amounts charged and adjusted against the provisions established in 2001 are as follows: 2003 Category Beginning Balance Adjustment to the Provision During 2003 Utilization During 2003 Ending Balance Other contractual obligations $ 3.1 $ $ (2.3 ) $ 0.8 Consolidation of excess facilities 97.3 (10.2 ) (26.7 ) 60.4 Total $ 100.4 $ (10.2 ) $ (29.0 ) $ 61.2 2002 Category Beginning Balance Adjustment to the Provision During 2002 Utilization During 2002 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 48.2 $ 19.3 $ (67.5 ) $ Other contractual obligations 23.7 (7.3 ) (13.3 ) 3.1 Consolidation of excess facilities 127.4 (0.2 ) (29.9 ) 97.3 Total $ 199.3 $ 11.8 $ (110.7 ) $ 100.4 The adjustment to the consolidation of excess facilities in 2003 related to the reactivation of a previously vacated facility. The adjustment to the provision for the workforce reduction in 2002 was primarily attributable to the finalization of severance payments associated with reductions in force in foreign jurisdictions. The adjustment to the provision for other contractual obligations in 2002 resulted from favorable settlements. 2001 Inventory Provision. The amounts charged and adjusted against the 2001 established provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are set forth below. The activity is reflected within cost of sales in our statement of operations. 24 Reduction in Cost of Sales Inventory Scrapped and Charged Against the Reserve 2003 Category Beginning Balance Inventory Sold Favorable Vendor Settlements Ending Balance Excess and obsolete EMC owned inventory $ 6.3 $ (5.4 ) $ $ $ 0.9 Reduction in Cost of Sales Inventory Scrapped and Charged Against the Reserve 2002 Category Beginning Balance Inventory Sold Favorable Vendor Settlements Ending Balance Excess and obsolete EMC owned inventory $ 226.2 $ (182.9 ) $ (37.0 ) $ $ 6.3 Excess and obsolete purchase obligations 29.3 (4.8 ) (20.9 ) (3.6 ) Total $ 255.5 $ (187.7 ) $ (57.9 ) $ (3.6 ) $ 6.3 Impact of the 2002 and 2001 Restructuring Programs. The 2002 and 2001 restructuring programs have been completed, although our ability to sell and sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions. The expected cash impact of the charges is $402.1, of which $101.9 was paid in 2003 and an aggregate of $190.3 was paid in 2002 and 2001. The remaining accrual balances primarily relate to the consolidation of facilities that will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012. Other Restructuring Programs During 1999, we recorded a charge of $223.6 relating to restructuring, merger and other special charges primarily associated with our acquisition of Data General. In 1998, we recorded a charge of $135.0 related to a Data General restructuring program and certain asset write downs resulting from the program. During 2003, the Data General restructuring accrual was reduced by $16.1. The reduction resulted from managements decision to utilize a facility for Documentum, LEGATO and certain of our other operations that we had previously vacated. Additionally, we favorably resolved a previously recognized contractual obligation. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining accrued obligations associated with the 1999 and 1998 charges are $12.3. The amount relates to remaining lease obligations for vacated facilities that will be paid through 2015 and executive severance obligations attributable to the acquisition of Data General. Cost Savings from the Restructuring Programs The 2003, 2002 and 2001 restructuring programs have reduced costs in all areas of our operations, favorably impacting cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. As of December 31, 2003, the annualized costs savings, compared to the cost structure in place as of the end of the second quarter of 2001, is in excess of $1,275.0. Investment Income Investment income was $187.8 and $256.2 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents, short and long term investments and sales type leases. Investment income decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 because of lower yields on outstanding investment balances and reduced realized gains from the sale of investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains, was 2.7% and 3.5% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Realized gains were $30.5 and $63.0 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. As a result of declining interest rates, we expect our investment income to be lower in 2004 compared to 2003. Other Expense, Net Other expenses, net were $14.9 and $47.4 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other expenses, net decreased due to a reduction in losses on disposal of assets. 25 Provision for Income Taxes In 2003, we reported pre tax income of $571.0 resulting in a provision for income taxes of $74.9. In 2002, we reported a pre tax loss of $296.5 resulting in income tax benefits of $177.8. In 2003, the effective income tax rate was 13.1%. The rate of benefit was 60.0% in 2002. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income (loss) for the year, the composition of the income (loss) in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of tax audits. For 2003, the effective tax rate varied from the statutory tax rate primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of a series of tax matters which aggregated $80.9 and the mix of income attributable to foreign versus domestic jurisdictions. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the United States. Partially offsetting this benefit were non deductible IPR&D charges of $29.1 incurred in connection with the acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum. We did not derive a tax benefit from these charges. For 2002, the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the overall favorable resolution of international tax matters, which aggregated $67.7. Additionally, a reduction in the valuation allowance resulting from the realization of capital loss carryforwards contributed to the favorable rate. We expect our income tax rate to be approximately 30.0% in 2004; however, the rate may vary depending upon the income for the year, the composition of the income (loss) in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of audits. COMPARISON OF FISCAL 2002 AND 2001 The following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total revenues. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost and expenses Cost of sales 61.0 59.9 Research and development 14.4 13.1 Selling, general and administrative 30.9 31.2 Restructuring and other special charges 2.8 5.6 Operating loss (9.1 ) (9.8 ) Investment income, interest expense and other expense, net 3.6 1.7 Loss before income taxes (5.5 ) (8.1 ) Benefit from income taxes (3.3 ) (0.9 ) Net loss (2.2 )% (7.2 )% Revenue The following table presents revenue by our segments: 2002 2001 $ Change % Change Information storage products $ 4,218.4 $ 5,867.2 $ (1,648.8 ) 28 % Information storage services 1,078.4 972.3 106.1 11 Other businesses 141.6 251.1 (109.5 ) 44 Total revenues $ 5,438.4 $ 7,090.6 $ (1,652.2 ) 23 % 26 Information storage systems revenues were $2,985.3 and $4,307.2 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,321.9, or 31%. This decrease was primarily due to declining sales volume and increased levels of competition. The global economic slowdown, which commenced in 2001 and continued throughout 2002, led to a reduction in information technology spending. Competitive pricing pressures also had an adverse effect on revenues. Information storage software revenues were $1,233.1 and $1,560.0 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing a decrease of $326.9, or 21%. The decrease was also primarily due to declining sales volume caused by the global economic slowdown and increased levels of competition. Information storage services revenues increased due to a greater volume of professional services, largely to support and implement automated networked storage solutions. Additionally, the increase was due to a growth in maintenance revenues associated with a greater volume of both software and hardware maintenance contracts. Other businesses revenues consist of revenues from AViiON server products and related services. Included in the 2001 amount was revenue from AViiON server products of $48.4. In the third quarter of 2001, we stopped selling AViiON server products. Accordingly, other businesses revenues for the last quarter of 2001 and all of 2002 were comprised only of AViiON services revenues. Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $3,225.4 and $4,185.4 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing a decrease of $960.0, or 23%. Revenues on sales into the European, Middle East and African markets were $1,327.8 and $1,774.9 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing a decrease of $447.1, or 25%. Revenues on sales into the Asia Pacific markets were $769.8 and $893.4 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing a decrease of $123.6, or 14%. Revenues on sales into the Latin American markets were $115.4 and $237.0 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing a decrease of $121.6, or 51%. The decline in revenues in all markets in 2002 was attributable to the global economic slowdown that began in 2001 and continued throughout 2002, which led to a reduction in information technology spending. Increased levels of competition, including competitive pricing pressures, also had an adverse effect on revenues. The decline in the Latin American markets in 2002 was further impacted by the regions political and currency instability. Changes in exchange rates in 2002 compared to 2001 did not have a material effect on revenues. At the time of sale, we provide for the potential returns of systems as a reduction of revenue. Our provision for sales returns was $158.6 in 2002 and $635.9 in 2001. We estimate the amount of returns based upon our historical experience, specific identification of probable returns and current market and economic conditions. The decrease in the provision for sales returns in 2002 compared to 2001 was attributable to a decline in revenue, a reduction in the level of actual returns and lower than expected sales returns for 2002 compared to 2001. 27  Costs and expenses The following table presents our costs and expenses and net loss. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. 2002 2001 $ Change % Change Cost of revenue: Information storage products $ 2,614.1 $ 3,489.4 $ (875.3 ) 25 % Information storage services 629.1 599.0 30.1 5 Other businesses 76.3 158.7 (82.4 ) 52 Total cost of revenue 3,319.5 4,247.0 (927.5 ) 22 Gross margins: Information storage products $ 1,604.3 $ 2,377.8 $ (773.5 ) 33 Information storage services 449.3 373.3 76.0 20 Other businesses 65.3 92.4 (27.1 ) 29 Total gross margin 2,118.8 2,843.6 (724.8 ) 26 Operating expenses: Research and development 781.5 928.7 (147.2 ) 16 Selling, general and administrative 1,680.8 2,214.2 (533.4 ) 24 Restructuring and other special charges 150.4 398.5 (248.1 ) 62 Total operating expenses 2,612.7 3,541.4 (928.7 ) 26 Operating loss (493.8 ) (697.8 ) 204.0 29 Investment income, interest expense and other expenses, net 197.3 120.8 76.5 63 Loss before income taxes (296.5 ) (577.0 ) 280.5 49 Benefit from income taxes (177.8 ) (69.3 ) (108.5 ) 157 Net loss $ (118.7 ) $ (507.7 ) $ 389.0 77 % In 2001, included in our costs and expenses was goodwill amortization of $52.4. As a result of implementing Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized. Gross Margins The gross margin percentages for information storage products were 38.0% and 40.5% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The gross margin percentage for 2001 was negatively impacted by $320.1, or 5.5%, for a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and impaired capitalized software. The gross margin percentage for 2002 was favorably impacted by $61.6, or 1.5%, resulting primarily from the sale of previously identified obsolete inventory for which a full reserve had been established. The decline in the gross margin percentage in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues resulting from lower sales volume, which caused fixed overhead costs to be absorbed over a lower sales base. In addition, lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing contributed to the decline. Partially offsetting this decline were reductions in our fixed overhead costs resulting from measures we took to reduce costs which were initiated in the second half of 2001. Additionally, the 2002 gross margin percentage was favorably impacted as a result of implementing FAS No. 142. The gross margin percentage for information storage services increased to 41.7% in 2002 compared to 38.4% in 2001. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to greater productivity of our customer service and professional services personnel. 28 The gross margin percentages for other businesses were 46.1% and 36.8% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage resulted primarily from this segment consisting only of services revenue in 2002 compared to both systems and services revenue in 2001. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 14.4% and 13.1% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, we spent $126.7 and $120.7 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, on software development, which costs were capitalized. R&D spending levels reflect our efforts to continue to improve our long term competitive position, offset in part by our continued cost cutting. R&D spending includes enhancements to information storage software and information storage systems, including networked information storage systems. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 30.9% and 31.2% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in SG&A in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to measures we took to reduce costs, which were initiated in the second half of 2001 and continued in 2002, enabling us to begin to achieve a cost structure commensurate with reduced revenue levels. Additionally, lower commission expense due to lower revenues reduced SG&A expenses. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts and notes receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of our receivables and current market and economic conditions. The provision for bad debts was $35.2 in 2002 and $32.7 in 2001. The increase in the provision in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to the general economic decline experienced worldwide. Restructuring and Other Special Charges During 2002 and 2001, we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on the highest potential growth areas of our business. In 2002 and 2001, we recognized restructuring and other special charges of $100.0 and $825.1, respectively. The 2002 charges consisted of $140.9 associated with the 2002 restructuring program, an $8.9 loss on assets associated with the 2002 restructuring program and $11.8 of additional restructuring costs associated with the 2001 restructuring program. Offsetting these costs in 2002 was a $61.6 benefit resulting primarily from the sale of previously identified obsolete inventory for which a reserve was established in 2001. The restructuring and other special charges have been classified within our statement of operations according to their related category. These categories are as follows: 2002 2001 Cost of sales $ (61.6 ) $ 320.0 Restructuring and other special charges 150.4 398.5 SG&A expenses 2.3 Other expense, net 8.9 106.6 Total $ 100.0 $ 825.1 The activity for 2002 and 2001 is explained in the following sections. 29 2002 Restructuring Program A summary of the costs for the 2002 restructuring program is outlined as follows: 2002 Category Initial Provision Utilization During 2002 Ending Balance Non Cash Portion of the Provision Workforce reduction $ 44.5 $ (22.4 ) $ 22.1 $ Consolidation of excess facilities 58.0 (5.4 ) 52.6 5.1 Asset impairment 21.5 (21.5 ) 21.5 Contractual and other obligations 16.9 (1.6 ) 15.3 Total $ 140.9 $ (50.9 ) $ 90.0 $ 26.6 2001 Restructuring Program The amounts charged and adjusted against the provisions established in 2001 are as follows: 2002 Category Beginning Balance Adjustment to the Provision During 2002 Utilization During 2002 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 48.2 $ 19.3 $ (67.5 ) $ Other contractual obligations 23.7 (7.3 ) (13.3 ) 3.1 Consolidation of excess facilities 127.4 (0.2 ) (29.9 ) 97.3 Total $ 199.3 $ 11.8 $ (110.7 ) $ 100.4 2001 Category Initial Provision Adjustment to the Provision During 2001 Utilization During 2001 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 111.5 $ (18.3 ) $ (45.0 ) $ 48.2 Impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and other long lived assets 104.5 (104.5 ) Other contractual obligations 34.5 (8.0 ) (2.8 ) 23.7 Consolidation of excess facilities 158.1 26.3 (57.0 ) 127.4 Total $ 408.6 $ $ (209.3 ) $ 199.3 The adjustment to the provision for workforce reduction in 2002 was primarily attributable to the finalization of severance payments associated with reductions in force in certain foreign jurisdictions. The adjustment to the provision for other contractual obligations in 2002 resulted from favorable settlements. The adjustment to the provision for the workforce reduction in 2001 primarily related to voluntary employee resignations. The adjustment to the provision for other contractual obligations in 2001 primarily related to a favorable settlement of an estimated liability for the closure of an information storage services business. The adjustment to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in 2001 primarily related to additional leased facilities being vacated. 30 2001 Inventory Provision. The amounts charged and adjusted against the 2001 established provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are set forth below. The activity is reflected within cost of sales in our statement of operations. Reduction in Cost of Sales Inventory Scrapped and Charged Against the Reserve 2002 Category Beginning Balance Inventory Sold Favorable Vendor Settlements Ending Balance Excess and obsolete EMC owned inventory $ 226.2 $ (182.9 ) $ (37.0 ) $ $ 6.3 Excess and obsolete purchase obligations 29.3 (4.8 ) (20.9 ) (3.6 ) Total $ 255.5 $ (187.7 ) $ (57.9 ) $ (3.6 ) $ 6.3 Reduction in Cost of Sales Inventory Scrapped and Charged Against the Reserve 2001 Category Initial Provision Inventory Sold Favorable Vendor Settlements Ending Balance Excess and obsolete EMC owned inventory $ 280.5 $ (54.3 ) $ $ $ 226.2 Excess and obsolete purchase obligations 29.5 (0.2 ) 29.3 Total $ 310.0 $ (54.5 ) $ $ $ 255.5 Other Charges. In 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of $106.6 for other than temporary declines in equity investments. These investments were in privately held companies, primarily in the storage industry, many of which were in the start up or development stage. These investments were carried at cost, subject to adjustment for impairment. Due to the continued global economic slowdown in 2001, as well as the downturn in the storage industry, we determined that the decline in these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss. Investment Income Investment income was $256.2 and $265.3 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents, short and long term investments and sales type leases. Investment income decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 because of lower yields on outstanding investment balances, partially offset by greater realized gains on the sale of investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains, was 3.5% and 4.8% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Realized gains were $63.0 and $45.4 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other Expense, Net Other expenses, net were $47.4 and $133.1 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other expense, net in 2002 was comprised primarily of losses on asset disposals and foreign currency exchange losses. Included in the 2001 amount was a $106.6 non cash charge for other than temporary declines in equity investments. These investments were carried at cost, subject to impairment. Due to the continued global economic slowdown in 2001, as well as the downturn in the storage industry, we determined that the decline in value of these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss. Provision for Income Taxes In 2002 and 2001, we reported pre tax losses resulting in income tax benefits of $177.8 and $69.3, respectively. The rates of benefit were 60.0% in 2002 compared to 12.0% in 2001. The effective income tax rate is based upon the loss for the year, the composition of the income (loss) in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of tax audits. For 2002, the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the overall 31 favorable resolution of international tax matters, which aggregated $67.7. Additionally, a reduction in the valuation allowance resulting from the realization of capital loss carryforwards contributed to the favorable rate. For 2001, the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate due to the mix of income and losses in foreign countries and the establishment of provisions associated with the impact of foreign tax audits, partially offset by a $133.2 tax benefit realized from a prior acquisition. The valuation allowance decreased by $31.1 in 2002 and $25.4 in 2001. Financial Condition Comparison of Fiscal 2003 to 2002 Cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were $6,907.6 and $5,685.6 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, an increase of $1,222.0. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,521.2 in 2003 compared to $1,445.7 in 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to improved profitability in our business, an increase in deferred revenues associated with a greater volume of software and hardware maintenance contracts and professional services engagements and $152.3 in income tax refunds, net of payments. Such increase was partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our Symmetrix product transition and a $107.4 contribution to fund a portion of the Data General pension plan liability. Cash used for investing activities was $1,313.2 and $1,576.4 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital additions were $368.5 and $391.1 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in capital additions resulted from our cost containment measures. The reduction in capital additions contributed to a decline in depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense declined from $653.7 in 2002, to $520.7 for 2003. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2004, primarily as a result of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of LEGATO, Documentum and VMware. Capitalized software development costs were $113.4 and $126.7 in 2003 and 2002. Net purchases and maturities of investments, consisting of debt securities, were $1,093.4 and $1,011.6 in 2003 and 2002. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of LEGATO and Documentum, our cash position increased by $323.9. Cash used for financing activities was $40.1 in 2003 compared to $311.2 in 2002. In 2003, we repurchased 11.5 million shares of our common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at a cost of $127.0. In 2002, we repurchased 49.5 million shares of our Common Stock at a cost of $363.9. As of December 31, 2003, we had repurchased 62.1 million shares of the 300.0 million shares of Common Stock authorized for repurchase by our Board of Directors. From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b 5 1 plans to facilitate our share repurchases. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was the generation of $112.6 and $80.9 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, from the exercise of stock options. In December 2003, we assumed, through our acquisition of Documentum, $125.0 in senior convertible notes that mature on April 1, 2007 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. Holders of the Notes are entitled to convert the Notes, at any time before the close of business on April 1, 2007, subject to prior redemption or repurchase of the Notes, into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $13.80 per share. The Notes may be redeemed by us on or after April 5, 2005 at a price of 101.8% through April 1, 2006 and at a price of 100.9% from April 2, 2006 through March 31, 2007. The Notes will effectively rank behind all other secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing those debts. The Notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants. The Notes have been recorded at the fair market value as of the date of the acquisition of Documentum, with a portion allocated to the conversion component. The fair market value of the debt component of $130.0 will be adjusted to the debts face value of $125.0 using the effective interest method through April 1, 2007. The fair market value of the conversion component of $26.3 has been allocated to additional paid in capital. 32 In January 2004, we purchased all the outstanding shares of preferred and common stock of VMware for $625.0. In addition, we issued 6.3 million options to purchase shares of our Common Stock in exchange for all outstanding options to purchase shares of VMware common stock. We have available for use credit lines of $50.0 in the United States and $50.0 in Brazil. The Brazilian line requires us to borrow in Brazilian currency. As of December 31, 2003, we had $1.2 outstanding on the Brazilian line of credit and there were no borrowings outstanding on the U.S. line of credit. The Brazilian credit line bears interest at the rate quoted by the lender (18.8% at December 31, 2003) and requires us to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses and maintaining minimum levels of cash and investments. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with the covenants. The Brazilian line of credit is denominated in local currency and as such, bears an interest rate commensurate with local currency short term interest rates. We derive revenues from both selling and leasing activity. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any estimated exposure. We also lend certain fixed income securities to generate investment income. We have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2003, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that the combination of funds currently available, funds to be generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the next twelve months. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. Comparison of Fiscal 2002 to 2001 Cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were $5,685.6 and $5,083.6 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $602.0. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,445.7 in 2002 compared to $1,631.3 in 2001. The decline was primarily attributable to a lower level of cash generated from working capital in 2002 compared to 2001. The 2002 reduction in working capital was driven by a reduction in cash generated from collecting accounts and notes receivable due to lower revenue levels in 2002 compared to 2001. Partially offsetting this reduction were increases in deferred revenue attributable to increased sales of maintenance contracts. Cash used for investing activities was $1,576.4 and $1,513.6 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital additions were $391.1 and $889.3 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in capital additions resulted from measures we took to reduce costs, which were initiated in the second half of 2001. Capitalized software development costs were $126.7 and $120.7 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net purchases and maturities of investments, consisting of debt securities, were $1,011.6 and $409.4 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash used for financing activities was $311.2 in 2002 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $33.4 in 2001. In 2002, we repurchased 49.5 million shares of our Common Stock a cost of $363.9. As of December 31, 2002, we had repurchased 50.6 million shares of the 300.0 million shares of Common Stock authorized for repurchase by our Board of Directors. In 2001, we distributed our ownership interest in McDATA Corporation. As a result of the distribution, McDATAs net assets are 33 no longer consolidated with our assets, which resulted in a $142.0 reduction in cash. The majority of the remaining cash generated in 2002 and 2001 was from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years* 3 5 years** More than 5 years Capital leases $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ $ $ Operating leases 589.1 176.0 205.4 101.9 105.8 Long term convertible debt 130.0 130.0 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations 86.5 6.1 31.8 10.4 38.2 Purchase orders 880.6 846.8 33.8 Total $ 1,687.2 $ 1,029.9 $ 271.0 $ 242.3 $ 144.0 *Includes payments from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006. **Includes payments from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The long term convertible debt pertains to debt issued by Documentum. The other long term obligations, including notes payable and the current portion of long term obligations, consist primarily of $34.7 of obligations associated with the Data General pension and post retirement medical plans and $27.9 of long term lease obligations for excess facilities. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $32.7 as of December 31, 2003. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. We have also agreed to guarantee our Brazilian subsidiarys $50.0 line of credit. As of December 31, 2003, we had $1.2 outstanding on this line of credit. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent or copyright. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. 34 We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for certain matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under certain of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. We have agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers of EMC Corporation and our subsidiaries to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. In connection with certain dispositions, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain matters, such as breaches of representations and warranties. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2003, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2003 is not material. Notes and Accounts Receivable We derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. From time to time, we may also sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial. Litigation On September 30, 2002, Hewlett Packard Company ("HP") filed a complaint against us in the United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe seven HP patents. HP seeks a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. We believe that HPs claims are without merit. On July 21, 2003, we answered the complaint and filed counterclaims alleging that certain HP products infringe six EMC patents. EMC seeks a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. On September 30, 2002, EMC filed a complaint against HP in the United States Federal District Court in Worcester, Massachusetts. The complaint alleged that certain HP products infringe six EMC patents. The suit sought a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. On June 20, 2003, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the suit without prejudice, and thereafter, the suit was dismissed by the court. We are a party (either as plaintiff or defendant) to various other patent litigation matters, including certain matters which we assumed in connection with our acquisitions of LEGATO and VMware. We are a party to other litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 35 Pension and Post Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plans We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the United States. Certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. All of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for these defined benefit plans are invested primarily in common stock, bonds and cash equivalent securities. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 8.2%. This rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2003. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2003 was 8.5%. Based upon current market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2004 will be 8.3%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately an $0.8 impact on the 2004 pension expense. As of December 31, 2003, the pension plans had a $106.1 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the discount rate was 6.5%. This rate represents the average of the discount rates for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by plan liabilities as of December 31, 2003. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For the U.S. plan, this rate is based on Moodys AA Corporate Bond Index. For international plans, the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.8 impact on the 2004 pension expense for all plans (international and U.S.). We also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the Data General acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. The plans assets are invested primarily in common stock, bonds and cash equivalent securities. The market related value of the plans assets is equal to the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on the plans assets for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 8.3%. Based on current capital market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2004 will remain at 8.3%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense. As of December 31, 2003, the plan had a $1.2 unrecognized actuarial gain that will be recognized over anticipated remaining years of service for participants. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the discount rate was 6.5%. The discount rate is based on Moodys AA Corporate Bond Index. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB"), No. 104, "Revenue Recognition"; Emerging Issues Task Force, No. 00 21,"Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"; Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition"; FAS No. 48, "Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists"; FAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases"; and SOP No. 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts," among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level. The analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates. The estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated losses on the sale of real estate, employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions and negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. 37 Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued FASB Interpretations ("FIN") No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51." FIN No. 46 provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights called "variable interest entities" or "VIEs" and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the "primary beneficiary"). This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either (1) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN No. 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a VIE make additional disclosures. The adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In February 2003, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21 ("EITF 00 21"), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." EITF 00 21 requires revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting. If the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria, arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values. Applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each unit. The guidance in EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." In general, this Statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of FAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This Statement establishes standards for an issuer to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument that meets certain characteristics as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of FAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 38  In December 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," that improves financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans. The change replaces existing FAS No. 132 disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits and revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement of recognition of those plans required by FAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" or FAS No. 88, "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits." FAS No. 132 revised retains the disclosure requirements contained in the original FAS No. 132, but requires additional disclosures about the plan assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. FAS No. 132 revised is effective for annual and interim periods with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. We have adopted the revised disclosure provisions. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 104 rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No. 101 related to multiple element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 39 FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, about our business and prospects. The forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be completed after the date hereof. Our future results may differ materially from our past results and from those projected in the forward looking statements due to various uncertainties and risks, including but not limited to those set forth below, one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements contained herein after the date of this Annual Report. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions. We are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions. Our operating results were materially adversely affected in 2001 and 2002 as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market. Our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our products and services. Our operating results were materially adversely affected in 2001 and 2002 as a result of reduced IT spending. Recently, we have experienced an increase in demand for our products and services; however, delays or reductions in IT spending, domestically or internationally, could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments. As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These acquisitions, including our acquisitions of LEGATO in October 2003, Documentum in December 2003 and VMware in January 2004, are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business, which may include, among other things: the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies the failure of the acquisition to result in expected benefits, which may include benefits relating to enhanced revenues, technology, human resources, costs savings, operating efficiencies and other synergies the difficulty and cost of integrating the acquired business, including costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and costs and delays caused by communication difficulties or geographic distances between the two companies sites the assumption of liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related liabilities the potential impairment of acquired assets the lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns 40 the impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the acquired business or our customers or suppliers the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the potential incompatibility of business cultures These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. To the extent that we issue shares of our Common Stock or other rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any future acquisition, existing stockholders may experience dilution and our earnings per share may decrease. In addition to the risks commonly encountered in the acquisition of a business as described above, we may also experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction. Further, the risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing the acquisitions of multiple acquisitions at the same time. We also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business. Competitive pricing, component costs and sales volume could materially adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and earnings. Competitive pricing pressures exist in the information storage market. There also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide storage related products or services, together with other IT products or services, at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share. We currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue. To date, we have been able to manage our component and product design costs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs. Moreover, certain competitors may have advantages due to vertical integration of their supply chain, which may include disk drives, microprocessors, memory components and servers. Our gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors, including competitive pricing, component and product design costs as well as the volume and relative mixture of product and services revenues. Increased pricing pressures, increased component costs, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in product price and component costs, changes in product and services revenue mixture or decreased volume could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, gross margins or earnings. If our suppliers are not able to meet our requirements, we could have decreased revenues and earnings. We purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers, including some of our competitors. These components and products include disk drives, high density memory components, power supplies and software developed and maintained by third parties. We have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time sensitive customer orders, be unable to develop or sell certain products cost effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies. The importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies, along with 41 our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales, intensifies the risk that the failure of a supplier to meet our quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers. There can be no assurance that our existing products will be properly positioned in the market or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis, or at all. We spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time. There can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products or new products will receive customer acceptance. As competition in the IT industry increases, it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits. Risks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage, networking and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products. Risks inherent in the transition to new products include: the difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced, thereby causing a decline in sales of existing products and an excessive, obsolete supply of inventory delays in initial shipments of new products. Further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors, competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The markets we serve are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively. We compete with many companies in the markets we serve, certain of which offer a broad spectrum of IT products and services and others which offer specific information storage or management products or services. Some of these companies (whether independently or by establishing alliances) may have substantially greater financial, marketing and technological resources, larger distribution capabilities, earlier access to customers and greater opportunity to address customers various IT requirements than us. We compete on the basis of our products features, performance and price as well as our services. Our failure to compete on any of these bases could affect demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Companies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us. Our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products, including hardware and software products, and services by our competitors, and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors. In addition, as we continue to increase our software and services businesses, we may face new competitive challenges. 42 We may have difficulty managing operations. Our future operating results will depend on our overall ability to manage operations, which includes, among other things: retaining and hiring, as required, the appropriate number of qualified employees enhancing, as appropriate, our infrastructure, including but not limited to, our information systems accurately forecasting revenues training our sales force to sell more software and services successfully integrating new acquisitions managing inventory levels, including minimizing excess and obsolete inventory, while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet customer demands controlling expenses managing our manufacturing capacity, real estate facilities and other assets executing on our plans An unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism. Terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, customers, partners, suppliers and distributors and resellers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment, including receipt of components and distribution of products. Our business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key or other employees, our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Historically uneven sales patterns could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and earnings. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarters total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter. This pattern makes prediction of revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. We believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including: the size of our product and services prices in relation to our customers budgets, resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval, which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business 43 the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first quarter of the following year seasonal influences Our uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there will be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, the ability to assemble, test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited, which could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings. In addition, our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. This is because: we assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers we generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty Loss of infrastructure, due to factors such as an information systems failure, loss of public utilities or extreme weather conditions, could impact our ability to ship products in a timely manner. Delays in product shipping or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses, could intensify the impact of these factors on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition to our direct sales force, we have agreements in place with many distributors, systems integrators, resellers and original equipment manufacturers to market and sell our products and services. We may, from time to time, derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated, if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, as our market opportunities change, we may have an increased reliance on channel partners, which may negatively impact our gross margins. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and market share. Furthermore, the partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce the visibility to our management of potential customers and demand for products and services, thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand. In addition, there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop, market or sell products or services in competition with us in the future. Changes in foreign conditions could impair our international operations. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, trade restrictions, import or export licensing requirements, the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries. 44 Undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results. If flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair, replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation. Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances. We have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies. Any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances, certain of which have substantially greater financial, marketing or technological resources than us, will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future, discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors. Our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property. We generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the United States and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. However, there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that, if obtainable, such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights. Responding to any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party, and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us. In the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings. Such matters can be time consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 45 We may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. From time to time, we are subject to income tax audits. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed with additional taxes, there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition. Changes in regulations could materially adversely affect us. Our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us or our products are newly implemented or changed. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as: the announcement of acquisitions, new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community In addition, our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and has been negatively affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions. If such conditions deteriorate, our stock price could decline. 46  ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Asset and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Brazil real, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and South East Asia. Despite the relatively small size of our exposure in these markets, the inherent volatility of these economies could negatively impact our financial results. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We employ a variance/covariance model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of December 31, 2003. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $0.5 million as of December 31, 2003 and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2002. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2003 and 2002 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2003 $ 0.6 $ 1.3 $ 0.3 2002 0.4 0.6 0.3 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. 47 Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. A portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk. We employ a variance/covariance model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of December 31, 2003. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $6.0 million as of December 31, 2003 and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2002. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2003 and 2002 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2003 $ 6.7 $ 7.7 $ 6.0 2002 7.3 8.2 5.5 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, short and long term investments and trade and notes receivable. We place our temporary cash investments and short and long term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment in any one issuer. During 2003, we purchased bank loans with credit ratings below investment grade. The bank loans have a senior position to other debt and have floating rate coupons, which significantly reduces interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2003, bank loans represent 6% of our temporary cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments. We believe this investment strategy more effectively manages our exposure to interest rate risk and diversifies our investment portfolio across different risk factors. We employ a variance/covariance model to calculate value at risk for changes in credit conditions for our bank loan portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the bank loan portfolios was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2003. The average, high and low value at risk amount for 2003 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2003 $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $39.5 million and $50.6 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. 48
