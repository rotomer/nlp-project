ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS beginning on page 33. The forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be completed after the date hereof. All dollar amounts in this MD&A are in millions, except per share amounts INTRODUCTION Our financial objective is to achieve profitable growth. Management believes that by providing a combination of systems, software, services and solutions to meet customers needs, we will be able to further increase revenues. Our operating income as a percentage of revenues increased from 6.4% for 2003 to 12.7% for 2004. Our efforts in 2003 and 2004 have been primarily focused on improving operating margins by increasing gross margins and reducing operating expenses. Additionally, we have been expanding our portfolio of offerings to satisfy our customers requirements. Our gross margins have increased from 39.0% in 2002 to 51.2% in 2004. We have increased our overall investment in R&D from $781.5 in 2002 to $847.9 in 2004. These R&D expenditures have enabled us to introduce new and enhanced product and service offerings. Our selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, have decreased from 30.9% in 2002 to 27.5% in 2004. Our R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, have decreased from 14.4% in 2002 to 10.3% in 2004. We plan to continue to focus our efforts in 2005 on improving our operating and gross margins and expanding our product offerings. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total revenues. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. 2004 2003 2002 Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost and expenses Cost of sales 48.8 54.4 61.0 Gross margin 51.2 45.6 39.0 Research and development 10.3 11.5 14.4 Selling, general and administrative 27.5 26.6 30.9 Restructuring and other special charges 0.7 1.1 2.8 Operating income (loss) 12.7 6.4 (9.1 ) Investment income, interest expense and other expense, net 1.7 2.7 3.6 Income (loss) before income taxes 14.4 9.2 (5.5 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 3.8 1.2 (3.3 ) Net income (loss) 10.6 % 8.0 % (2.2 )% 16 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenue by our segments: Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 vs 2003 2003 vs 2002 Information storage products $ 4,979.9 $ 4,206.4 $ 3,762.0 18 % 12 % Information storage and management services 1,530.4 1,262.5 1,000.0 21 26 EMC Software Group products and services 1,437.4 668.4 534.8 115 25 VMware products and services 218.2 * Other businesses 63.6 99.5 141.6 (36 ) (30 ) Total revenues $ 8,229.5 $ 6,236.8 $ 5,438.4 32 % 15 % * Not Measurable Information storage products revenues include information storage systems and information storage software revenues. Information storage systems revenues were $3,871.0, $3,314.7 and $2,985.3 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing increases of 17% in 2004 and 11% in 2003. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were due to greater demand for these products attributable to wider acceptance of information lifecycle management based solutions, a broadened product portfolio, increased demand for IT infrastructure and new and enhanced distribution channels. Information storage software revenues were $1,108.9, $891.7 and $776.7 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing increases of 24% in 2004 and 15% in 2003. Information storage software revenues consist of revenues from platform based software whose operation generally controls and enables functions that take place within an EMC storage system. The increases in 2004 and 2003 in information storage software revenues were attributable to an expanded product offering, a greater demand for software to manage increasingly complex high end and midrange networked storage environments and new and enhanced distribution channels. Information storage and management services revenues include software and hardware maintenance and professional services revenues. Software and hardware maintenance accounted for 51.1%, 50.5% and 46.2% of total information storage and management services revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Professional services accounted for 48.9%, 49.5% and 53.8% of total information storage and management services revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Information storage and management services revenues increased in 2004 and 2003 due to greater demand for both software and hardware maintenance contracts associated with increases in sales of information storage products. Additionally, increased demand for professional services, largely to support and implement information lifecycle management based solutions, contributed to the increases in 2004 and 2003. The EMC Software Group products and services segment was established in July 2004. The EMC Software Group products and services revenues include LEGATO products and services revenues and Documentum products and services revenues that were historically presented in separate segments. The EMC Software Group products and services revenues also include EMC multi platform software licenses and related software maintenance revenues that were historically included in our information storage products and information storage and management services segments. The 2004 and 2003 increases in the EMC Software Group products and services revenues were primarily attributable to the incremental revenue related to the acquisitions of Documentum and LEGATO as well as greater demand for EMC multi platform software products. The VMware products and services segment was established as a result of the acquisition of VMware in January 2004. VMwares technology enables multiple operating systems to run simultaneously and independently on the same Intel based server or workstation and move live applications across systems without any business disruption. From the date of acquisition (January 9, 2004) through December 31, 2004, VMware products and services revenues were $218.2. 17 Table of Contents Other businesses revenues consist of revenues from AViiON maintenance services. These revenues are expected to continue to decline in future years as we have discontinued selling AViiON servers. Revenues by geography were as follows: Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 vs 2003 2003 vs 2002 North America, excluding Mexico $ 4,755.8 $ 3,740.7 $ 3,225.4 27 % 16 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 2,355.9 1,645.0 1,327.8 43 24 Asia Pacific 926.0 709.4 769.8 31 (8 ) Latin America and Mexico 191.8 141.7 115.4 35 23 Revenue increased in 2004 and 2003 in these markets due to greater demand for our products and services. Also contributing to the increases were revenues generated from the acquisitions of Documentum, LEGATO and VMware, new and enhanced distribution channels, broadened product offerings and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 in the Asia Pacific markets was due to several large non recurring customer orders received in 2002. Changes in exchange rates favorably impacted revenue growth by 3.7% in each of 2004 and 2003. The impact of the change in rates in 2004 and 2003 was most significant in the European market, primarily Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. At the time of sale, we provide for the potential returns of products as a reduction of revenue. We estimate the amount of returns based upon our historical experience, specific identification of probable returns and current market and economic conditions. In 2004 and 2003, we decreased our provision for potential sales returns by $5.7 and $19.4, respectively. The reductions in the provisions were attributable to improved economic conditions and a favorable experience in the level of actual returns compared to our expectations. We expect our revenues for 2005 to grow at approximately twice the rate of the storage and information management IT markets, which we estimate will grow around 7% to 8%. Additionally, we expect that our revenues will be positively impacted by the acquisition of Systems Management Arts Incorporated (Smarts), which was completed in February 2005. However, our revenues could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy, demand for IT infrastructure, product availability, competitive factors and changes in exchange rates. 18 Table of Contents Costs and expenses The following table presents our costs and expenses and net income. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 vs 2003 2003 vs 2002 Cost of revenue: Information storage products $ 2,876.4 $ 2,594.8 $2,541.0 11 % 2 % Information storage and management services 748.4 638.5 601.3 17 6 EMC Software Group products and services 315.7 115.5 101.0 173 14 VMware products and services 44.7 * Other businesses 29.7 46.0 76.3 (35 ) (40 ) Total cost of revenue 4,014.9 3,394.8 3,319.5 18 2 Gross margins: Information storage products 2,103.5 1,611.6 1,221.0 31 32 Information storage and management services 782.0 624.0 398.7 25 57 EMC Software Group products and services 1,121.7 553.0 433.8 103 27 VMware products and services 173.5 * Other businesses 33.9 53.5 65.3 (37 ) (18 ) Total gross margin 4,214.6 2,842.1 2,118.8 48 34 Operating expenses: Research and development 847.9 718.5 781.5 18 (8 ) Selling, general and administrative 2,266.7 1,656.2 1,680.8 37 (1 ) Restructuring and other special charges 56.1 66.3 150.4 (15 ) (56 ) Total operating expenses 3,170.6 2,440.9 2,612.7 30 (7 ) Operating income (loss) 1,043.9 401.2 (493.8 ) 160 * Investment income, interest expense and other expenses, net 141.0 169.9 197.3 (17 ) (14 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (benefit) 1,185.0 571.0 (296.5 ) 108 * Provision (benefit) for income taxes 313.8 74.9 (177.8 ) 319 * Net income (loss) $ 871.1 $ 496.1 $(118.7 ) 76 % * * Not Measurable Gross Margins Our overall gross margin percentages were 51.2% in 2004, 45.6% in 2003 and 39.0% in 2002. Information storage products gross margin percentages were 42.2%, 38.3% and 32.5% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage for both 2004 and 2003 was attributable to achieving higher sales volumes while at the same time improving our operating cost structure. Partially offsetting the improvements in the gross margin percentages in 2004 and 2003 were increased provisions for product warranties which were $146.5 in 2004 and $90.4 in 2003. The increases in the provisions for both 2004 and 2003 were attributable to a greater number of systems sold and a longer average warranty period provided to customers compared to prior years. The gross margin percentage for 2002 was favorably impacted by $61.6, or 1.6%, resulting primarily from the sale of previously identified obsolete inventory for which a reserve was established in 2001. 19 Table of Contents The gross margin percentages for information storage and management services were 51.1%, 49.4% and 39.9% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The improvements in both 2004 and 2003 were driven by a shift in the mix of our services offerings with a greater proportion of revenues being derived from software and hardware maintenance contracts compared to professional services revenues. Maintenance revenues provide a higher gross margin than professional services revenues. Additionally, the increases in the gross margin percentages in both 2004 and 2003 were attributable to improvements in the gross margins earned from professional services. The gross margin percentages for the EMC Software Group products and services segment were 78.0%, 82.7% and 81.1% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to intangible amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum. The decrease in the gross margin percentage was also attributable to a change in the revenue mix. In 2004, software maintenance and professional services accounted for a greater proportion of total revenue as compared to 2003. Software license revenues have a higher gross margin than software maintenance and professional services revenues. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum, both of which were consummated in the fourth quarter of 2003. The gross margin percentage for the VMware products and services segment was 79.5% in 2004. The gross margin percentages for other businesses were 53.4%, 53.7% and 46.1% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted from declining revenues in this segment as the volume of maintenance contracts decreased. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2003 compared to 2002 resulted from reducing costs in this segment as we discontinued selling servers. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses were 10.3%, 11.5% and 14.4% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, we spent $166.3, $113.4 and $126.7 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, on software development, which costs were capitalized. R&D spending includes enhancements to our software and information storage systems. The increase in R&D expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the increased salaries and related costs from the LEGATO, Documentum and VMware acquisitions. The decrease in R&D expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 was attributable to our cost cutting initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 27.5%, 26.6% and 30.9% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars spent in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the increased salaries and related costs from the LEGATO, Documentum and VMware acquisitions. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the acquisitions of LEGATO, Documentum and VMware. These operations have a higher selling cost as a percentage of revenue than EMC has historically incurred. The decrease in absolute dollars spent in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to savings associated with our cost cutting initiatives and a reduction in bad debt expense. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to an increase in revenues while decreasing our operating costs. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts and notes receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of our receivables and current market and economic conditions. The provision for bad debts was $10.1 in 2004, $1.8 in 2003 and $35.2 in 2002. The increase in the provision in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to our increased sales. The decrease in the provision in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to the improvement in our collection experience and expected collection 20 Table of Contents rate of our outstanding accounts and notes receivable balance. Our quarterly average days sales outstanding were 45 days in 2004, 47 days in 2003 and 63 days in 2002. Restructuring and Other Special Charges In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $56.1, $66.3 and $150.4. The 2004 charge consisted of $17.4 of in process R&D (IPR&D) charges associated with acquisitions ($15.2 related to VMware) and $38.7 of restructuring charges. The 2004 restructuring programs consisted of $24.5 of employee termination benefits associated with reductions in force and $2.1 of costs associated with vacating excess facilities. The remaining $12.1 of charges was associated with prior restructuring programs, primarily relating to additional rent expense for vacated facilities. The additional rent expense was attributable to a revised estimate of the time needed to sublet the facilities. The 2003 charge consisted of $29.1 of IPR&D charges associated with the LEGATO and Documentum acquisitions, $18.6 of employee termination benefits associated with reductions in force, $2.8 associated with vacating excess facilities, $10.5 pertaining to an asset impairment and $5.3 associated with prior restructuring programs. The 2002 charge consisted of $44.5 of employee termination benefits associated with reductions in force, $58.0 associated with vacating excess facilities, $21.5 pertaining to asset impairments, $16.9 associated with contractual and other obligations for which we no longer derive an economic benefit and $11.8 associated with a prior restructuring program. For purposes of presentation, $2.3 of the charge was classified within selling, general and administrative expenses within the statement of operations. The activity for each charge is explained in the following sections. 2004 Restructuring Programs The activity for the 2004 restructuring programs for the year ended December 31, 2004 is presented below: Adjustments 2004 to the Initial Provision Utilization Category Provision During 2004 During 2004 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 26.8 $ (2.4 ) $ (8.1 ) $ 16.3 Elimination of excess facilities 2.2 (0.5 ) 1.7 Total $ 29.0 $ (2.4 ) $ (8.6 ) $ 18.0 The 2004 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one which commenced in the first quarter of 2004 and the second which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2004, aggregating approximately 400 employees across our major business functions and all major geographic regions. Approximately 72% of the affected employees are or were based in North America, excluding Mexico, and 28% are or were based in Europe, Latin America, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 180 employees have been terminated. The 2004 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2005, with the remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2006. Amounts relating to the elimination of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2005. The expected cash impact of the 2004 restructuring charge is $26.6, of which $8.6 was paid in 2004. The $2.4 reversal to the provision for workforce reduction was attributable to a decrease in the number of individuals included in the reduction in force which commenced in the first quarter of 2004. 21 Table of Contents The 2004 restructuring programs impacted our information storage products, information storage and management services and EMC Software Group products and services segments. 2003 Restructuring Program The activity for the 2003 restructuring program for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is presented below: 2004 Adjustments to Beginning the Provision Utilization Category Balance During 2004 During 2004 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 14.7 $ (4.8 ) $ (8.6 ) $ 1.3 Elimination of excess facilities 2.3 7.9 (4.7 ) 5.5 Total $ 17.0 $ 3.1 $ (13.3 ) $ 6.8 2003 Non Cash Initial Utilization Ending Portion of the Category Provision During 2003 Balance Provision Workforce reduction $ 18.6 $ (3.9 ) $ 14.7 $ Asset impairment 10.5 (10.5 ) 10.5 Elimination of excess facilities 2.8 (0.5 ) 2.3 0.6 Total $ 31.9 $ (14.9 ) $ 17.0 $ 11.1 The $4.8 reversal of the provision for workforce reduction in 2004 was attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for reduction. The $7.9 addition to the provision for elimination of excess facilities in 2004 related to additional charges for facilities being vacated. In 2003, as a result of the LEGATO acquisition, we recognized an impairment charge of $10.5 for a duplicative EMC software project. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded its fair value, measured as the present value of its estimated discounted cash flows. The impaired asset is classified within our EMC Software Group products and services segment. The workforce reduction impacted approximately 200 employees across our major business functions and all our major geographic regions. The 2003 restructuring program impacted our information storage products, information storage and management services and EMC Software Group products and services segments. 2002 Restructuring Program The activity for the 2002 restructuring program for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented below: Adjustments 2004 to the Beginning Provision Utilization Ending Category Balance During 2004 During 2004 Balance Workforce reduction $ 6.6 $ (2.1 ) $ (3.3 ) $ 1.2 Consolidation of excess facilities 37.2 (0.6 ) (12.1 ) 24.5 Contractual and other obligations 4.9 (3.0 ) 1.9 Total $ 48.7 $ (2.7 ) $ (18.4 ) $ 27.6 22 Table of Contents Adjustments 2003 to the Beginning Provision Utilization Ending Category Balance During 2003 During 2003 Balance Workforce reduction $ 22.1 $ 24.1 $ (39.6 ) $ 6.6 Consolidation of excess facilities 52.6 6.1 (21.5 ) 37.2 Contractual and other obligations 15.3 1.3 (11.7 ) 4.9 Total $ 90.0 $ 31.5 $ (72.8 ) $ 48.7 2002 Non Cash Initial Utilization Ending Portion of the Category Provision During 2002 Balance Provision Workforce reduction $ 44.5 $ (22.4 ) $ 22.1 $ Consolidation of excess facilities 58.0 (5.4 ) 52.6 5.1 Asset impairments 21.5 (21.5 ) 21.5 Contractual and other obligations 16.9 (1.6 ) 15.3 Total $ 140.9 $ (50.9 ) $ 90.0 $ 26.6 The $24.1 addition to the provision for workforce reduction in 2003 was primarily attributable to finalizing severance packages for employees in foreign jurisdictions. The $6.1 addition to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in 2003 represents the charges for facilities being vacated, offset by the reversal of reserves related to the reactivation of facilities that had previously been vacated. The asset impairment charges in 2002 resulted from consolidating the locations of and modifications made to our Internet hosting business and the write down of assets within one of our Data Generals services business which we put up for sale. The impairment charge relating to the Internet hosting business was equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded their fair value, measured as the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows. The impairment charge relating to the assets used within our Data Generals services business were determined by comparing the expected sales proceeds to the assets carrying value. The impaired assets were classified within the information storage and management services and other businesses segments. The 2002 restructuring program impacted our information storage products, information storage and management services, EMC Software Group products and services and other businesses segments. In addition to these restructuring programs, we have remaining liabilities aggregating $62.8 associated with prior years restructuring programs. All restructuring programs, with the exception of the 2004 restructuring programs, are complete although our ability to sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions. The total liability for all of our restructuring programs was $115.3 as of December 31, 2004. The remaining balance relates primarily to consolidation of facilities and employee termination benefits. These amounts are expected to be paid out through 2015. The 2004, 2003 and 2002 restructuring programs have reduced costs in all areas of our operations, favorably impacting cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. As of December 31, 2004, the annualized cost savings expected from these programs was approximately $180.0. As of December 31, 2004, we had a goodwill balance of $3,284.4. At least annually, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of December 31, 2004, none of the reporting units had any indications that goodwill was likely to be impaired. As we continue to refine our business model, we will reassess our cost structure and asset deployment to assess whether additional reductions are necessary. Should we determine that additional reductions will benefit our business, we may incur additional restructuring and other special charges. If customer demand for products change or we acquire complimentary products, we may be required to write down the value of assets. Additionally, changes in our business model could cause goodwill or other assets to be impaired. 23 Table of Contents Investment Income Investment income was $156.7, $187.8 and $256.2 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash and cash equivalents, short and long term investments and sales type leases. Investment income decreased in both 2004 and 2003 from the previous years due to lower yields on outstanding investment balances and reduced realized gains from the sale of investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains, was 2.6%, 2.7% and 3.5% in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Realized gains (losses) were $(11.7), $30.5 and $63.0 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We lend certain fixed income securities to generate investment income. We have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net were $8.2, $14.9 and $47.4 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to gains from selling strategic investments, partially offset by increased foreign currency exchange losses. The decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to a reduction in losses on disposal of assets. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 26.5%, 13.1% and 60.0% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004 and 2003, we reported pre tax income, whereas in 2002, we reported a pre tax loss. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income (loss) for the year, the composition of the income (loss) in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of tax audits. For 2004 and 2003, the effective tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the mix of income attributable to foreign versus domestic jurisdictions. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the United States. For 2004, the effective income tax rate also varied from the statutory tax rate as a result of a $20.0 reduction in our estimated income tax exposure pertaining to certain of our international tax liabilities. Partially offsetting these benefits were non deductible IPR&D charges of $17.4 incurred in connection with acquisitions. We did not derive a tax benefit from these charges. For 2003, the effective tax rate also varied from the statutory tax rate as a result of the favorable resolution of a series of tax matters which aggregated $80.9. The tax matters included the resolution of certain merger related contingencies. Partially offsetting these benefits were non deductible IPR&D charges of $29.1 in 2003 incurred in connection with acquisitions. We did not derive a tax benefit from these charges. For 2002, the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the overall favorable resolution of international tax matters, which aggregated $67.7. Additionally, a reduction in the valuation allowance resulting from the realization of capital loss carryforwards contributed to the favorable rate. Financial Condition Cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were $7,440.8, $6,907.6 and $5,685.6 at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We invest our excess cash in U.S. government and agency obligations, U.S. corporate debt securities, asset and mortgage backed securities, bank loans, auction rate securities and foreign debt securities. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our short and long term investments was $5,964.0 compared to an amortized cost basis of $5,992.7. Included in our portfolio are securities where the amortized cost basis exceeded the fair value by $38.5. Management regularly reviews the portfolio to evaluate whether any impairments are other than temporary. Management considers the type of securities held, market conditions, the length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the 24 Table of Contents investment to maturity to make its evaluation. As of December 31, 2004, management did not consider any impairments to be other than temporary. Cash provided by operating activities was $2,102.3 in 2004, $1,521.2 in 2003 and $1,445.7 in 2002. Cash received from customers was $8,329.4, $6,693.8 and $6,145.9 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The annual increases were attributable to higher sales volume, improved accounts receivable turnover and greater cash proceeds from the sale of maintenance contracts. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $6,299.1, $5,507.7 and $5,060.2 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The annual increases were partially attributable to higher headcount. Total headcount was approximately 22,700, 20,000 and 17,400 at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The acquisitions of LEGATO and Documentum in 2003, VMware in 2004 and general growth of the business accounted for the headcount increases. Additionally, greater levels of component purchases to meet customer demand for information storage systems in 2004 and 2003 contributed to the increased amounts of payments to suppliers. Cash received from dividends and interest was $162.4, $185.9 and $252.0 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The annual declines were due to lower rates of return received on our cash, cash equivalents and short and long term investments. In 2004, we paid $84.0 in income taxes. In 2003 and 2002, we received $152.3 and $119.7, respectively, in net tax refunds. In 2001 and 2002, we filed carryback claims associated with prior years federal income tax payments. We received those payments in 2003 and 2002. The payments in 2004 represent our net payouts of international, federal and state income tax liabilities. Cash used for investing activities was $2,064.7, $1,059.4, and $1,380.3 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, we acquired all the outstanding shares of VMware for $539.4. Capital additions were $371.4, $368.5 and $391.1 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was $616.4, $520.7 and $653.7 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to intangible amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of Documentum, LEGATO and VMware. The decrease in the expense in 2003 compared to 2002 was attributable to the reduction in capital additions. Capitalized software development costs were $166.3, $113.4 and $126.7 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in the amount capitalized in 2004 was attributable to the Documentum, LEGATO and VMware acquisitions. Net purchases and maturities of investments, were $858.1, $839.6 and $815.5 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash used for financing activities was $323.8, $40.1 and $311.2 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our principal financing activity has been the repurchase of our common stock in the open market. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of 300.0 million shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2004, we have repurchased 108.6 million shares, spending $545.7, $127.0 and $363.9 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We anticipate we will purchase additional shares of our common stock during 2005, however the number of shares purchased and timing of our purchases will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the price of our stock, market conditions, our cash position and alternative demands for our cash resources. We generated $230.0, $112.6 and $80.9 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, from the exercise of stock options. In December 2003, we assumed, through our acquisition of Documentum, $125.0 in senior convertible notes that mature on April 1, 2007 (the Notes). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. Holders of the Notes are entitled to convert the Notes, at any time before the close of business on April 1, 2007, subject to prior redemption or repurchase of the Notes, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $13.80 per share. The Notes may be redeemed by us on or after April 5, 2005 at a price of 101.8% of the face value through April 1, 2006 and at a price of 100.9% of the face value from April 2, 2006 through March 31, 2007. The Notes will effectively rank behind all other secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing those debts. The Notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants. The Notes have been recorded at the fair market value as of the date of the acquisition of Documentum, with a portion allocated to the conversion component. The fair market value of the debt component as of the acquisition date of $130.0 is being adjusted to the debts face value of $125.0 using the effective interest method through April 1, 2007. The fair market value of the conversion component of $26.3 has been allocated to additional paid in capital. 25 Table of Contents We have a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. At December 31, 2004, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the banks base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with the covenants. We derive revenues from both selling and leasing activity. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any estimated exposure. Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that the combination of funds currently available, funds to be generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months. In February 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Smarts for approximately $260.0 in cash, subject to certain post closing adjustments. Smarts software products automatically locate root cause problems, calculate their impacts across technology domains, and present the logical action plan required to keep business services up and running. While we expect our revenues to be positively impacted by the acquisition, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our revenues or expenses in 2005. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period Less than 3 5 More than Total 1 Year 1 3 years* years ** 5 Years Operating leases $ 486.1 $ 149.8 $ 161.6 $ 86.9 $ 87.8 Long term convertible debt 128.5 128.5 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations 110.1 0.2 55.8 10.6 43.5 Purchase orders 1,067.0 1,024.3 42.7 Total $ 1,791.7 $ 1,174.3 $ 388.6 $ 97.5 $ 131.3 * Includes payments from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007. ** Includes payments from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The long term convertible debt pertains to debt assumed in our acquisition of Documentum. The other long term obligations, including notes payable and the current portion of long term obligations, consist primarily of $70.8 of post retirement benefit obligations and $30.9 of long term lease obligations for excess facilities. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. 26 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $64.3 as of December 31, 2004. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and or other intellectual property rights. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. We have agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers of EMC and our subsidiaries to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. In connection with certain dispositions, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain matters, such as breaches of representations and warranties. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2004, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2004 are not material. Notes and Accounts Receivable We derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. From time to time, we may also sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial. Litigation On September 30, 2002, Hewlett Packard Company (HP) filed a complaint against us in the United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe seven HP patents (the First HP Lawsuit). HP seeks a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. We believe that HPs claims are without merit. On July 21, 2003, we answered the complaint and filed counterclaims alleging that certain HP products 27 Table of Contents infringe six EMC patents. We seek a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. On February 16, 2005, summary judgment motions were heard. The courts ruling on such motions is currently pending. On October 27, 2004, a second complaint was filed by HP against us in the same court based on six of the seven patents asserted in the First HP Lawsuit (the Second HP Lawsuit). The Second HP Lawsuit was filed shortly after the court had denied HPs motion for leave to amend its infringement contentions in the First HP Lawsuit to add certain EMC products. In the Second HP Lawsuit, HP alleges patent infringement by the same EMC products that they attempted to add to the First HP Lawsuit. On February 3, 2005, the court stayed the Second HP Lawsuit. We are a party (either as plaintiff or defendant) to various other patent litigation matters, including certain matters which we assumed in connection with our acquisitions of LEGATO and VMware. We are a party to other litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Pension and Post Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plans We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the United States. Certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. All of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for these defined benefit plans are invested in common stocks and bonds. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 8.2%. This rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2004. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2004 was 9.5%. Based upon current market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2005 will be 8.3%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a $0.9 impact on the 2005 pension expense. As of December 31, 2004, the pension plans had a $117.6 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 5.7%. This rate represents the average of the discount rates for all defined benefit plans (international and U.S.) weighted by plan liabilities as of December 31, 2004. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For the U.S. plan, this rate is based on Moodys AA Corporate Bond Index. For international plans, the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.7 impact on the 2005 pension expense for all plans (international and U.S.). We also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the Data General acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. The plans assets are invested in common stocks and bonds. The market related value of the plans assets is equal to the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on the plans assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 8.3%. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2004 was 9.5%. Based on current capital market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2005 will remain at 8.3%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense. As of December 31, 2004, the plan had a $1.1 unrecognized actuarial gain that will be recognized over the anticipated remaining years of service for participants. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 5.7%. The discount rate is based on Moodys AA Corporate Bond Index. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB), No. 104, Revenue Recognition; Emerging Issues Task Force, No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables; Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition; FAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists; FAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases; and SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level. The analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates. The estimates are based upon 29 Table of Contents our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2004, 2003, 2002 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated losses on the sale of real estate, employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions and negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. Accounting for Stock Options We recognize stock option costs pursuant to APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and have elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, in the notes to our financial statements. Effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, we will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. Both FAS No. 123 and 123R require management to make assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options, including the expected life of the stock options and the volatility of the stock options. Changes to the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the stock options, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved the consensus reached on the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (EITF) No. 03 01, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03 01 provides guidance on determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. EITF 03 01 also provides new disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments on debt and equity investments. In September 2004, the FASB delayed until further notice the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance contained in EITF 03 01, however the disclosure requirements of EITF 03 01 are currently effective. The adoption of EITF 03 01 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after November 23, 2004. 30 Table of Contents The provisions of Statement No. 151 should be applied prospectively. The adoption of FAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. The statement replaces FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions. The adoption of the statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees in the basic financial statements. Previously, we elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements. See Accounting for Stock Based Compensation in Note A to the financial statements. The statement is effective for the quarters commencing after June 15, 2005. The statement applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified, repurchased, or canceled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date. The compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under Statement No. 123. Changes to the grant date fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded. The compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of this statement using the attribution method that was used under Statement No. 123, except that the method of recognizing forfeitures only as they occur shall not be continued. Any unearned or deferred compensation (contra equity accounts) related to those earlier awards shall be eliminated against the appropriate equity accounts. Additionally, common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option. The statement also allows for a modified version of retrospective application to periods before the effective date. Modified retrospective application may be applied either (a) to all prior years for which Statement No. 123 was effective or (b) only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption. An entity that chooses to apply the modified retrospective method to all prior years for which Statement No. 123 was effective shall adjust financial statements for prior periods to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards granted, modified, or settled in cash in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by Statement No. 123. Accordingly, compensation cost and the related tax effects will be recognized in those financial statements as though they had been accounted for under Statement No. 123. Changes to amounts as originally measured on a pro forma basis are precluded. The adoption of FAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our results of operations, increasing cost of sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses. The future results will be impacted by the number and value of additional stock option grants as well as the value of existing unvested stock options. We have utilized the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the value of our stock options. We estimated volatility to be 46.4%, 55.0% and 55.0% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in volatility in 2004 compared to the prior two years was due to our recent volatility experience. We estimated the expected life of stock options that were issued to be 4.2 years, 5.0 years and 5.0 years in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in the expected life in 2004 compared to the prior two years was due to a change in current exercise patterns. For more information on the impact of expensing stock options on the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, see Accounting for Stock Based Compensation in Note A to the financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets, which is an amendment to APB Opinion No. 29. The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This statement amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the 31 Table of Contents exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The adoption of FAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) was passed. The AJCA provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. In return, the AJCA also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the European Union. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109 1 treats the deduction as a special deduction as described in FAS No. 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the same period in which the deduction is claimed in our tax return. We are currently evaluating the impact the AJCA will have on our results of operations and financial position. The AJCA also creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations. We are currently evaluating the AJCA and are not yet in a position to decide whether, or to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S.; however, upon finalization of our assessment, it is reasonably possible that we will repatriate some amount given that our total unremitted earnings as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $3,200. The amount of income tax we would incur should we repatriate some level of earnings cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We expect to finalize our assessment sometime in 2005. 32 Table of Contents FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, about our business and prospects. The forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be completed after the date hereof. Our future results may differ materially from our past results and from those projected in the forward looking statements due to various uncertainties and risks, including but not limited to those set forth below, one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements contained herein after the date of this Annual Report. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions. We are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions. If these conditions deteriorate, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market. Our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending, domestically or internationally, could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings. Component costs, competitive pricing, and sales volume and mix could materially adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and earnings. Our gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors, including competitive pricing, component and product design costs as well as the volume and relative mixture of product and services revenues. Increased component costs, increased pricing pressures, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product price, changes in product and services revenue mixture or decreased volume could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, gross margins or earnings. The costs of third party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs. While we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs, we may have difficulty managing such costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase. We currently expect that the availability of certain disk drives will be limited in the first half of 2005 so we may experience an increase in our component costs. An increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and earnings. Moreover, certain competitors may have advantages due to vertical integration of their supply chain, which may include disk drives, microprocessors, memory components and servers. The markets in which we do business are highly competitive and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally. There also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide storage related products or services, together with other IT products or services, at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share. Such price competition may result in pressure on our product prices and reductions in product prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, gross margins and earnings. We currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue. 33 Table of Contents If our suppliers are not able to meet our requirements, we could have decreased revenues and earnings. We purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers, including some of our competitors. These components and products include disk drives, high density memory components, power supplies and software developed and maintained by third parties. We have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time sensitive customer orders, be unable to develop or sell certain products cost effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies. The importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies, along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales, intensifies the risk that the failure of a supplier to meet our quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments. As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business, which may include, among other things: the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies the failure of the acquisition to result in expected benefits, which may include benefits relating to enhanced revenues, technology, human resources, costs savings, operating efficiencies and other synergies the difficulty and cost of integrating the acquired business, including costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and costs and delays caused by communication difficulties or geographic distances between the two companies sites the assumption of liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related liabilities the potential impairment of acquired assets the lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the acquired business or our customers or suppliers the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the potential incompatibility of business cultures These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. To the extent that we issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase our common stock in connection with any future acquisition, existing stockholders may experience dilution and our earnings per share may decrease. In addition to the risks commonly encountered in the acquisition of a business as described above, we may also experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction. Further, the risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing multiple acquisitions at the same time. 34 Table of Contents We also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers. There can be no assurance that our existing products will be properly positioned in the market or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis, or at all. We spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time. There can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products and solutions or new products and solutions will receive customer acceptance. As competition in the IT industry increases, it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits. Risks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage, networking and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products. Risks inherent in the transition to new products include: the difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced, thereby causing a decline in sales of existing products and an excessive, obsolete supply of inventory delays in initial shipments of new products Further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors, competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The markets we serve are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively. We compete with many companies in the markets we serve, certain of which offer a broad spectrum of IT products and services and others which offer specific information storage, management or virtualization products or services. Some of these companies (whether independently or by establishing alliances) may have substantially greater financial, marketing and technological resources, larger distribution capabilities, earlier access to customers and greater opportunity to address customers various IT requirements than us. In addition, as the IT industry consolidates, companies may improve their competitive position and ability to compete against us. We compete on the basis of our products features, performance and price as well as our services. Our failure to compete on any of these bases could affect demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Companies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us. Our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products, including hardware and software products and services by our competitors, and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors. The material adverse effect to our business could include a decrease in demand for our products and services and an increase in the length of our sales cycle due to customers taking longer to compare products and services and to complete their purchases. 35 Table of Contents We may have difficulty managing operations. Our future operating results will depend on our overall ability to manage operations, which includes, among other things: retaining and hiring, as required, the appropriate number of qualified employees managing, protecting and enhancing, as appropriate, our infrastructure, including but not limited to, our information systems accurately forecasting revenues training our sales force to sell more software and services successfully integrating new acquisitions managing inventory levels, including minimizing excess and obsolete inventory, while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet customer demands controlling expenses managing our manufacturing capacity, real estate facilities and other assets executing on our plans An unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism. Terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, customers, partners, suppliers, distributors and resellers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment, including receipt of components and distribution of products. Our business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key or other employees, our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our quarterly revenues and earnings could be materially adversely affected by uneven sales patterns and changing purchasing behaviors. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarters total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter. This pattern makes prediction of revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. We believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including: the relative dollar amount of our product and services offerings in relation to many of our customers budgets, resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval, which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business 36 Table of Contents the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first six months of the following year seasonal influences Our uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there will be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, the ability to assemble, test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited, which could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings. In addition, our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. This is because: we assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers we generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty Loss of infrastructure, due to factors such as an information systems failure, loss of public utilities or extreme weather conditions, could impact our ability to ship products in a timely manner. Delays in product shipping or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses, could intensify the impact of these factors on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, unanticipated changes in our customers purchasing behaviors such as customers taking longer to negotiate and complete their purchases or making smaller, incremental purchases based on their current needs, also make the prediction of revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period difficult and uncertain and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Risks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition to our direct sales force, we have agreements in place with many distributors, systems integrators, resellers and original equipment manufacturers to market and sell our products and services. We may, from time to time, derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated, if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, as our market opportunities change, we may have an increased reliance on channel partners, which may negatively impact our gross margins. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and market share. Furthermore, the partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce the visibility to our management of potential customers and demand for products and services, thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand. In addition, there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop, market or sell products or services in competition with us in the future. In addition, as we focus on new market opportunities and additional customers through our various distribution channels, including small to medium sized businesses, we may be required to provide different levels of service and support than we typically provided in the past. We may have difficulty managing directly or indirectly through our channels these different service and support requirements and may be required to incur substantial costs to provide such services which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 37 Table of Contents Changes in foreign conditions could impair our international operations. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, trade restrictions, import or export licensing requirements, the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries. Undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results. If flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair, replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation. Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances. We have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies. Any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances, certain of which have substantially greater financial, marketing or technological resources than us, will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future, discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors. Our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property. We generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the United States and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. However, there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that, if obtainable, such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights. Responding to any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party, and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 38 Table of Contents We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us. From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. From time to time, we are subject to income tax audits. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed with additional taxes, there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition. Changes in regulations could materially adversely affect us. Our business, results of operations or financial conditions could be materially adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us or our products are newly implemented or changed. In addition, our compliance with existing regulations, such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, may have a material adverse impact on us. Under Sarbanes Oxley, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Compliance with this legislation may divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expense. Should we or our independent auditors determine that we have material weaknesses in our internal controls, our results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected or our stock price may decline. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as: the announcement of acquisitions, new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community In addition, our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and has been negatively affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions. If such conditions deteriorate, our stock price could decline. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Brazil real. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and South East Asia. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by BearMeasurisk as of December 31, 2004. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $0.7 million as of December 31, 2004 and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2003. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2004 $ 0.6 $ 0.7 $ 0.5 2003 $ 0.6 $ 1.3 $ 0.3 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. 40 Table of Contents A portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the BearMeasurisk dataset as of December 31, 2004. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $6.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and $6.0 million as of December 31, 2003. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2004 $ 7.5 $ 9.6 $ 5.8 2003 $ 6.7 $ 7.7 $ 6.0 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, short and long term investments, accounts and notes receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We place our temporary cash investments and short and long term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer. We purchased bank loans with credit ratings below investment grade. The bank loans have a senior position to other debt and have floating rate coupons, which significantly reduces interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2004, bank loans represent 7% of our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments. We believe this investment strategy more effectively manages our exposure to interest rate risk and diversifies our investment portfolio. We have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of the contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in credit conditions for our bank loan portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among credit spreads, market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the BearMeasurisk dataset as of December 31, 2004. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the bank loan portfolios was $1.0 million as of December 31, 2004 and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2003. The average, high and low value at risk amount for 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2004 $ 0.9 $ 1.3 $ 0.5 2003 $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 41 Table of Contents The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $41.7 million and $42.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. 42 Table of Contents
