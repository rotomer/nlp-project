ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. The forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, securities offerings or business combinations that may be announced or consummated after the date hereof. All dollar amounts in this MD&A are in millions, except per share amounts. Certain tables may not add due to rounding. INTRODUCTION Our financial objective is to achieve profitable growth. Management believes that by providing a combination of systems, software, services and solutions to meet customers needs, we will be able to further profitably increase revenues. Our efforts over the past few years have been primarily focused on growing revenues by enhancing and expanding our portfolio of offerings to satisfy our customers information infrastructure requirements. We have increased our overall investment in research and development (R&D) from $847.9 in 2004 to $1,254.2 in 2006. These R&D expenditures have enabled us to introduce new and enhanced offerings. We have also made acquisitions over the past three years to expand our offerings. Additionally, as further discussed below, in 2006 we implemented an integration plan for EMC and most of the acquisitions we have made over the past three years. The objectives of the plan are to improve efficiencies across our business and reduce costs, while helping us to present a more unified One EMC appearance to our customers. Through a combination of increasing our revenues and controlling the level of cost increases, our objective is to increase our overall level of profitability. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues In the fourth quarter of 2006, we realigned our business into four segments: Information storage, Content management and archiving, VMware virtual infrastructure and RSA information security. We have conformed our prior period presentations to be consistent with our current segments. The following table presents revenue by our segments: Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs 2005 2005 vs 2004 Information storage $ 9,608.6 $ 8,792.2 $ 7,615.0 9.3 % 15.5 % Content management and archiving 685.8 484.3 396.3 41.6 22.2 VMware virtual infrastructure 709.0 387.5 218.2 83.0 77.6 RSA information security 151.7 NM NM Total revenues $ 11,155.1 $ 9,664.0 $ 8,229.5 15.4 % 17.4 % NM not measurable The Information storage segment revenues include systems, software license and services revenues. Systems revenues were $5,124.8, $4,486.9 and $3,871.0 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 14.2% in 2006 and 15.9% in 2005. The increases in 2006 and 2005 were due to greater demand for these products attributable to wider acceptance of information lifecycle management based solutions, a broadened product portfolio, increased demand for IT infrastructure and new and enhanced distribution channels. Software license revenues were $2,015.3, $2,005.9 and $1,813.1 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 0.5% in 2006 and 10.6% in 2005. Software license revenues increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher demand for our resource management software and backup and recovery software. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in platform based software revenues due to a change in the mix of mid range information storage systems sold resulting in more lower end units with a decreased software content. Additionally, within our high end storage system product line, we sold a greater proportion of larger systems in 2006 compared to 2005 which resulted in less platform based software revenues. The increase in 2005 software license revenues compared to 2004 was attributable to higher platform based 19 Table of Contents software revenues due to an expanded product offering, a greater demand for software to manage increasingly complex high end and midrange networked storage environments and new and enhanced distribution channels. Services revenues were $2,468.5, $2,299.4 and $1,930.9 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 7.4% in 2006 and 19.1% in 2005. Services revenues consist of software and hardware maintenance and professional services revenues. Services revenues increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to greater demand for our software support. Additionally, increased demand for professional services, largely to support and implement information lifecycle management based solutions, contributed to the increase. The increase in 2005 services revenues was also impacted by greater demand for hardware maintenance contracts associated with increased sales of information storage systems. Partially offsetting the increases in services revenues in 2006 and 2005 was a decrease in AViiON maintenance services revenues. These revenues are expected to continue to decline in future years, as we have discontinued selling AViiON servers. The Content management and archiving segment revenues include software license and services revenues. Software license revenues were $323.6, $228.7 and $192.7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 41.5% in 2006 and 18.7% in 2005. Software license revenue increased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to greater demand for content management software. Software license revenues for 2006 were favorably impacted by $63.7 from the Captiva acquisition which was completed in December 2005. Services revenues were $353.6, $255.5 and $203.6 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 38.4% in 2006 and 25.5% in 2005. The increase in services revenues in 2006 and 2005 was primarily attributable to higher software maintenance revenues and higher professional services revenues. Services revenues for 2006 were favorably impacted by $38.1 from the Captiva acquisition. The VMware virtual infrastructure segment revenues include software license and services revenues. Software license revenues were $494.6, $287.5 and $178.3 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 72.0% in 2006 and 61.2% in 2005. The software license revenue increases in 2006 and 2005 were attributable to increased demand for virtual infrastructure software and the introduction of new product offerings. Services revenues were $214.4, $99.9 and $39.9 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 114.6% in 2006 and 150.4% in 2005. The increases in 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to higher software maintenance revenues associated with the growth in sales of virtualization software product offerings. The RSA information security segment was created during the third quarter of 2006 as a result of our acquisitions of RSA and Network Intelligence. The RSA information security segment provides technologies to secure information no matter where it resides or travels inside or outside of an organization and throughout its lifecycle and includes systems, software license, software maintenance and other services revenues. Total revenues for the period from the dates of acquisition through December 31, 2006 were $151.7. Revenues by geography were as follows: Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs 2005 2005 vs 2004 United States $ 6,319.7 $ 5,468.6 $ 4,631.3 15.6 % 18.1 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 3,232.6 2,743.8 2,355.9 17.8 16.5 Asia Pacific 1,126.2 1,061.2 926.0 6.1 14.6 Latin America, Mexico and Canada 476.6 390.3 316.3 22.1 23.4 Revenue increased in 2006 and 2005 in all of our markets due to greater demand for our products and services. The lower growth rate in the Asia Pacific markets in 2006 was primarily attributable to lower levels of demand in Japan. Changes in exchange rates adversely impacted revenue growth by 0.2% in 2006 and positively impacted revenue growth by 0.8% in 2005 and 3.7% in 2004. The impact of the change in rates in 2006 was most significant in the Asia Pacific market, primarily Japan. In 2005 and 2004, the impact of the change in rates was most significant in the European market, primarily Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Costs and expenses Our results of operations were impacted by a significant increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment (FAS No. 123R) for 2006, as described further below. We selected the modified prospective transition method of adoption, which does not result in the restatement of results from prior periods, and accordingly, our gross and operating margins as a percentage of total revenue declined during 2006 compared to 2005. We do not expect a similar type of decline to occur in 2007 because both the 2006 and 2007 results will include the effect of accounting for stock based compensation under FAS No. 123R. 20 Table of Contents FAS No. 123R requires recognizing compensation costs for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based upon the awards estimated grant date fair value. The standard covers employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Additionally, we applied the provisions of the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 on Share Based Payment to our adoption of FAS No. 123R. Previously, we elected to account for these share based payment awards under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and elected to only disclose the pro forma impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements. Total after tax stock based compensation expense, which consists of expense from employee stock options, ESPP and restricted stock awards, was $317.3 in 2006. For periods prior to our adoption of FAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, stock based compensation expense consisted of expense from restricted stock awards and the amortization of deferred compensation costs associated with stock options issued as consideration in various acquisitions. Accordingly, our financial results in 2006 were not prepared on a comparative basis to our financial results in 2005 and 2004. Total after tax stock based compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 was $52.1 and $40.3, respectively. We elected to estimate the fair value of employee stock option awards and ESPP purchases using the Black Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include the expected term of the awards, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk free interest rate associated with the expected term of the awards and the expected dividends. In 2006, our Black Scholes option model included the following weighted average assumptions for our employee stock options and ESPP: Stock Options ESPP Dividend yield None None Expected volatility 35.2% 27.6% Risk free interest rate 4.80% 4.82% Expected life (in years) 4.0 0.5 Weighted average fair value at grant date $ 3.80 $ 2.89 To determine an expected volatility assumption required in the Black Scholes option pricing model, we used a combination of implied volatility for six month and two year traded options on our stock as well as our historical stock price volatility. The expected term assumption is based upon actual historical exercises and cancellations of EMC stock options. We are using the same methodology to calculate expected volatility and expected term that was used prior to our adoption of FAS No. 123R. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of our employee stock options and ESPP. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts. Stock based compensation expense recognized within a given reporting period is based on awards that are expected to vest in current or future periods. Accordingly, recognized stock based compensation expense from stock options and ESPP is reduced for expected forfeitures. FAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our implementation of FAS No. 123R. 21 Table of Contents The following table presents our costs and expenses, other income and net income.

Incremental stock based compensation expense recognized within cost of product sales and cost of services as a result of adopting FAS No. 123R was $53.9 in 2006, negatively impacting our overall gross margin by 0.5%. Additionally, our overall gross margin in 2006 was negatively impacted 1.3% by the Information storage segment and 0.2% by increases in intangible amortization expense associated with acquisitions. Our overall gross margin in 2006 was favorably impacted 0.8% by the VMware virtual infrastructure segment, 0.2% by the Content management and archiving segment and 0.3% by the incremental margin generated from the RSA information security segment as a result of the acquisitions of RSA and Network Intelligence during the third quarter of 2006. Our overall gross margin in 2005 was favorably impacted 1.9% by the Information storage segment and 0.6% by the VMware virtual infrastructure segment. The Content management and archiving segment had a neutral impact on our overall gross margin in 2005 compared to 2004. For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation and acquisition related intangible asset amortization are recognized as corporate expenses and are not allocated among our various operating segments. Stock based compensation expense and acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense was $160.6, $77.7 and $80.6 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense was $94.3, $72.5 and $75.7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of Captiva in December 2005 and RSA in September 2006. Stock based compensation expense was $66.3, $5.2 and $4.9 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The stock based compensation expense increase in 2006 was primarily due to the adoption of FAS No. 123R. 22 Table of Contents Gross margin percentages for the Information storage segment were 51.0%, 52.2% and 50.0% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2006 was attributable to a reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues, to 21.0% in 2006 from 22.8% in 2005. Software license revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than systems revenues and services revenues. Additionally, margins generated on both our maintenance and professional services businesses decreased due to increased labor and third party maintenance costs. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2005 was attributable to achieving higher sales volumes while at the same time improving our manufacturing cost structure. Provisions for product warranties, which reduce storage gross margins, were $127.4 in 2005 and $146.5 in 2004. In 2005, as a result of cost control efforts, we were able to reduce the cost of fulfilling our service obligations. These efforts reduced the provision as a percentage of systems revenues to 2.8% in 2005 compared to 3.8% in 2004. The gross margin percentage in 2005 was also favorably impacted by improvements in the gross margin percentages earned from professional services which resulted primarily from reducing our services cost structure and an increase in the mix of software maintenance revenues as a percentage of total services revenue. Software maintenance revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than other services revenues. The gross margin percentages for the Content management and archiving segment were 67.1%, 69.1% and 72.5% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in gross margin percentage in 2006 was primarily attributable to lower margins generated on our professional services businesses due to increased labor costs as well as higher amortization expense from increased capitalized software development costs. Partially offsetting the decrease in gross margin percentage was a 1.7% favorable impact due to the Captiva acquisition which was completed in December 2005. The decrease in gross margin percentage in 2005 was primarily due to a reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues declined to 47.2% in 2005 from 48.6% in 2004. Software license revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than services revenues. Additionally, higher amortization expense associated with increased capitalized software development costs contributed to the decrease in gross margin percentage. The gross margin percentage for the VMware virtual infrastructure segment was 84.9% in 2006, 88.3% in 2005 and 91.7% for 2004. The decrease in the gross margin percentages in both 2006 and 2005 was attributable to a reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues declined to 69.8% in 2006 from 74.2% in 2005 and 81.7% in 2004. Software license revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than services revenues. The gross margin percentage for the RSA information security segment was 75.2% in 2006. The RSA information security segment was created during the third quarter of 2006 as a result of our acquisitions of RSA and Network Intelligence. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 11.2%, 10.4% and 10.3% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, we incurred $215.6, $167.1 and $166.3 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, on software development costs which were capitalized. Software development costs increased from 2005 to 2006 due to increased development efforts across all of our segments. Incremental stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting FAS No. 123R was $52.5 in 2006, increasing R&D as a percentage of revenue by 0.5% compared to 2005. R&D spending includes research and development on new product offerings and enhancements to our software and information storage systems. In addition to incremental stock based compensation expense, R&D expenses increased in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2005 compared to 2004 due to increased investments to support new product development and incremental R&D efforts resulting from the acquisitions of RSA in 2006 and Smarts and Captiva in 2005. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 29.2%, 27.0% and 27.5% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Incremental stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting FAS No. 123R was $131.9 in 2006, negatively impacting SG&A as a percentage of revenues by 1.2% compared to 2005. In addition to incremental stock based compensation expense, the majority of the increase in SG&A expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 consisted of increases to support our newly acquired higher growth businesses. The expense increases were primarily incremental selling costs and salaries and benefits associated with personnel for these businesses. SG&A expenses increased in absolute dollars in 2005 compared to 2004 but decreased as a percentage of revenue as we achieved higher sales volumes while controlling our cost structure. 23 Table of Contents In process Research and Development In process research and development (IPR&D) was $35.4, $17.4 and $17.4 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in IPR&D in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in both the number of acquisitions and the R&D levels of businesses acquired. Restructuring Charges In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred restructuring charges of $162.6, $84.2 and $38.6, respectively. The 2006 charge consisted of $129.4 for employee termination benefits associated with a reduction in workforce plans, a $29.7 charge associated with abandoned assets for which we will no longer derive a benefit, a $5.7 charge associated with vacating excess facilities and a $10.9 charge for other contract terminations. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $13.1 associated with prior years restructuring programs. The 2005 charge consisted of $84.1 for employee termination benefits associated with workforce rebalancing and reductions in force efforts and $0.4 of costs associated with vacating excess facilities. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $0.3 associated with prior years restructuring programs. The 2004 charge consisted of $24.5 of employee termination benefits associated with reductions in force and $2.1 associated with vacating excess facilities. The remaining $12.0 of charges was associated with prior restructuring programs, primarily relating to additional rent expense for vacated facilities. The additional rent expense was attributable to a revised estimate of the time needed to sublet facilities. The activity for each charge is explained in the following sections. 2006 Restructuring Programs The activity for the 2006 restructuring programs for the year ended December 31, 2006 is presented below: Category InitialProvision UtilizationDuring 2006 EndingBalance Non CashPortion of theProvision Workforce reductions $ 129.4 $ (1.5 ) $ 127.8 $ 10.7 Asset impairment 29.7 (29.7 ) 29.7 Consolidation of excess facilities 5.7 (0.2 ) 5.5 Contractual and other obligations 10.9 (6.1 ) 4.8 Total $ 175.7 $ (37.5 ) $ 138.2 $ 40.4 The 2006 restructuring programs included a workforce reduction that was finalized on December 29, 2006 and covers approximately 1,350 employees worldwide. The workforce reductions objective is to further integrate EMC and the majority of the businesses we have acquired over the past three years. These actions impacted our major business functions and major geographic regions. Approximately 70% of the affected employees are or were based in North America, excluding Mexico, and 30% are or were based in Europe, Latin America, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 100 employees have been terminated. The asset impairment charge of $29.7 consists primarily of internal infrastructure projects that management decided to no longer pursue. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded its fair value, measured as the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows. The restructuring programs impacted the Information storage and Content management and archiving segments. The workforce reductions include $10.7 of non cash stock based compensation expense. The 2006 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2007 with the remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2008. The expected cash impact of the 2006 restructuring charges is $135.3, of which $7.8 was paid in 2006. 24 Table of Contents 2005 Restructuring Programs The activity for the 2005 restructuring programs for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is presented below: 2006 Category BeginningBalance Adjustmentsto theProvisionDuring 2006 UtilizationDuring 2006 Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 79.8 $ (2.3 ) $ (59.4 ) $ 18.0 Consolidation of excess facilities 0.1 0.1 Total $ 79.8 $ (2.2 ) $ (59.4 ) $ 18.2 2005 Category InitialProvision Adjustmentsto theProvisionDuring 2005 UtilizationDuring 2005 Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 84.1 $ $ (4.4 ) $ 79.8 Consolidation of excess facilities 0.4 (0.4 ) Total $ 84.6 $ $ (4.8 ) $ 79.8 The 2005 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one that commenced in the first quarter of 2005 and a second that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005, aggregating approximately 1,060 employees. These actions impacted our major business functions and major geographic regions. Approximately 67% of the affected employees were based in North America, excluding Mexico, and 33% were based in Europe, Latin America, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2006, the restructuring programs had been substantially completed. The restructuring programs impacted the Information storage and Content management and archiving segments. The adjustment to the provision in 2006 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for termination and lower than expected severance benefits. The remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction are expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2007. The expected cash impact of the 2005 restructuring charges is $78.3, of which $4.8 was paid in 2005 and $55.3 was paid in 2006. 2004 Restructuring Programs The activity for the 2004 restructuring programs for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below: 2006 Category BeginningBalance Adjustmentsto theProvisionDuring 2006 UtilizationDuring 2006 Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 5.7 $ (2.2 ) $ (3.1 ) $ 0.5 Consolidation of excess facilities 0.1 (0.1 ) Total $ 5.8 $ (2.3 ) $ (3.1 ) $ 0.5 2005 Category BeginningBalance Adjustmentsto theProvisionDuring 2005 UtilizationDuring 2005 Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 16.4 $ (1.1 ) $ (9.6 ) $ 5.7 Consolidation of excess facilities 1.7 (0.5 ) (1.1 ) 0.1 Total $ 18.0 $ (1.5 ) $ (10.7 ) $ 5.8 2004 Category InitialProvision Adjustmentsto theProvisionDuring 2004 UtilizationDuring 2004 Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 26.8 $ (2.4 ) $ (8.1 ) $ 16.4 Consolidation of excess facilities 2.2 (0.1 ) (0.5 ) 1.7 Total $ 29.0 $ (2.4 ) $ (8.6 ) $ 18.0 25 Table of Contents The 2004 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one that commenced in the first quarter of 2004 and a second that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2004, aggregating approximately 400 employees across our major business functions and all major geographic regions. As of December 31, 2006, substantially all of the employees have been terminated. The remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction are expected to be paid by the end of 2007. The expected cash impact of the 2004 restructuring charge is $22.9, of which $8.6 was paid in 2004, $10.7 was paid in 2005 and $3.1 was paid in 2006. The reversal to the provision for workforce reduction in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for termination and lower than expected severance benefits. The 2004 restructuring programs impacted the Information storage and Content management and archiving segments. Prior Year Restructuring Programs Prior to 2004, we had instituted several restructuring programs. The activity for these programs for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below: 2006 Category BeginningBalance Adjustments tothe ProvisionDuring 2006 UtilizationDuring 2006 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 1.3 $ (0.5 ) $ (0.1 ) $ 0.7 Consolidation of excess facilities 65.3 (8.4 ) (16.8 ) 40.1 Other contractual obligations 2.4 0.3 (0.7 ) 1.9 Total $ 69.0 $ (8.6 ) $ (17.7 ) $ 42.7 2005 Category BeginningBalance Adjustments tothe ProvisionDuring 2005 UtilizationDuring 2005 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 3.3 $ (0.7 ) $ (1.3 ) $ 1.3 Consolidation of excess facilities 91.3 2.1 (28.1 ) 65.3 Other contractual obligations 2.6 (0.2 ) 2.4 Total $ 97.2 $ 1.2 $ (29.4 ) $ 69.0 2004 Category BeginningBalance Adjustments tothe ProvisionDuring 2004 UtilizationDuring 2004 Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 27.1 $ (11.7 ) $ (12.1 ) $ 3.3 Consolidation of excess facilities 106.3 23.7 (38.7 ) 91.3 Other contractual obligations 5.7 (3.1 ) 2.6 Total $ 139.1 $ 12.0 $ (53.9 ) $ 97.2 The reductions to the provisions in 2006 for excess facilities were a result of higher than anticipated sublease income from facilities associated with our 2001 restructuring program. The net additions to the provisions in 2005 and 2004 were the result of higher than anticipated costs associated with vacating facilities associated with our 2001 restructuring program. These additions were partially offset by a reduction in the number of individuals originally identified for termination. The prior year restructuring programs impacted the Information storage and Content management and archiving segments. All restructuring programs, with the exception of the 2006 programs are substantially complete, although our ability to sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions. The remaining liability for the consolidation of excess facilities is expected to be paid through 2015. As we continue to refine our business model, we will reassess our cost structure and asset deployment to assess whether additional changes are necessary. Should we determine that additional restructuring programs will benefit our business, we may incur additional charges. If customer demand for products changes, we may be required to write down the value of assets. Additionally, changes in our business model or market conditions could cause goodwill or other assets to be impaired. 26 Table of Contents Investment Income Investment income was $224.9, $190.4 and $156.7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment income increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to greater yields on investments and decreased realized losses on investments, partially offset by lower average outstanding cash and investment balances due to a significant increase in repurchases of our common stock in the open market. Investment income increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher outstanding cash and investment balances and greater yields on investments and was partially offset by increased realized losses on investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized losses, was 4.2%, 3.4% and 2.6% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net realized losses were $27.8, $58.9 and $11.7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense was $34.1, $8.0 and $7.5 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher debt balances. In September 2006, we borrowed $2,200.0 under a six month unsecured credit facility to finance the acquisition of RSA. In November 2006, we completed the issuance of our $1,725.0 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and our $1,725.0 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes and, together with the 2011 Notes, the Notes). A portion of the proceeds from the Notes was used to repay in full the $2,200.0 of outstanding indebtedness under the aforementioned unsecured credit facility. Interest expense in 2005 and 2004 was primarily attributable to interest associated with our $125.0 4.5% Senior Convertible Notes due April 1, 2007, which were assumed in connection with the Documentum (the Documentum Notes) acquisition. The Documentum Notes were redeemed in April 2006. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $8.6, $10.6 and $8.2 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in other expense in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 11.7%, 31.4% and 26.5% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits, resolutions of tax audits or other tax contingencies. For 2006, 2005 and 2004 the effective tax rate varied from the statutory rate as a result of the mix of income attributable to foreign versus domestic jurisdictions. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the United States. Additionally, in 2006, we recognized an income tax benefit of $171.8 from the favorable resolution of income tax audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. Partially offsetting these benefits were non deductible IPR&D charges of $35.4 from acquisitions and $73.3 in non deductible stock based compensation expense for options issued as incentive stock options and shares issued under EMCs ESPP. In 2005, we repatriated approximately $3,000.0 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). The repatriation resulted in an incremental income tax expense of $180.2. Also in 2005, we incurred $17.4 of non deductible IPR&D charges from acquisitions. These unfavorable increases to our effective tax rate were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $163.9 from the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. For 2004, as a result of tax audits, we recognized a $20.0 reduction in our estimated income tax exposure pertaining to our international tax liabilities. Partially offsetting these benefits were non deductible IPR&D charges of $17.4 from acquisitions. Financial Condition Cash provided by operating activities was $2,140.4 in 2006, $2,216.3 in 2005 and $2,102.3 in 2004. Cash received from customers was $11,167.2, $9,732.8 and $8,329.4 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The annual increases were attributable to higher sales volume and greater cash proceeds from the sale of maintenance contracts. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $8,666.6, $7,539.9 and $6,299.1 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The annual increases were partially attributable to higher headcount. Total headcount was approximately 31,100, 26,500 and 22,700 at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The majority of the headcount increases was due to the general growth of the business, as well as increased acquisition activity including the acquisitions of Smarts and Captiva in 2005 and RSA in 2006. Greater levels of inventory purchases to support the transition to our next generation storage systems also contributed to the increased amounts of payments to suppliers. Inventory increased from $724.8 at December 31, 2005 to $834.8 at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory levels for new products to support the overall growth of the business. Cash received from dividends and interest was $258.6, $249.2 and $162.4 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The annual increases were due to higher rates of return received on our cash, cash equivalents and short and long term investments. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we paid $592.1, $216.7 and $84.0, 27 Table of Contents respectively, in income taxes. The cash paid for income taxes in 2006 includes $125.9 associated with the repatriation of funds under the AJCA. The annual increases were due to a combination of higher pre tax income and a reduction in the amount of net operating losses available to reduce our taxable income. Cash used for investing activities was $2,296.7, $611.7 and $2,064.7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $2,618.4, $683.7 and $590.4, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital additions were $718.1, $601.1 and $371.4 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increases in capital spending in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable to various IT initiatives to further integrate our acquisitions, to enable us to more effectively service our growing customer base and to support the overall growth of the business. Capitalized software development costs were $192.9, $167.1 and $166.3 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Software development costs increased from 2005 to 2006 due to increased development efforts across all of our segments. Net sales (purchases) and maturities of investments were $1,253.6, $868.4 and $(858.1) in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This activity varies from year to year based upon our cash collections, cash requirements and maturity dates of our investments. Cash used for financing activities was $392.0, $743.6 and $323.8 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of 500.0 million shares of our common stock. In 2006, we repurchased 227.3 million shares of our common stock. Of the 500.0 million shares authorized for repurchase, we have cumulatively repurchased 359.8 million shares at a total cost of $4,389.0, leaving a remaining balance of 140.2 million shares authorized for future repurchases. In 2006, the Board also authorized a one time repurchase of up to 100.0 million shares in conjunction with our issuance of the Notes. Of this amount, 75.0 million shares were repurchased using $945.8 of the net proceeds from the Notes. We spent $3,655.4, $1,003.4 and $545.7 on such repurchases in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We plan to spend at least $1,000.0 on common stock repurchases during 2007; however, the number of shares purchased and timing of our purchases will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the price of our stock, market conditions, our cash position and alternative demands for our cash resources. We generated $257.8, $263.3 and $230.0 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from the exercise of stock options. Proceeds from short and long term obligations were $5,654.0, $0.2 and $0.1 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In September 2006, we borrowed $2,200.0 under a six month unsecured credit facility to finance the acquisition of RSA. In November 2006, we also closed the sale of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes for an aggregate amount of $3,450.0. Total payments of short and long term obligations were $2,331.6, $3.7 and $8.2 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in total payments in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 was primarily attributable to $2,200.0 to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under our six month unsecured credit facility which was used to finance the acquisition of RSA and $126.1 paid to redeem the outstanding principal balance of the Documentum Notes. In November 2006, we issued our 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes for total gross proceeds of $3,450.0. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate amount of liabilities of our subsidiaries was approximately $2,200.0, excluding intercompany liabilities. Holders may convert their Notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding (i) September 1, 2011, with respect to the 2011 Notes, and (ii) September 1, 2013, with respect to the 2013 Notes, in each case only under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the price per Note of the applicable series for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Notes. Additionally, the Notes will become convertible during the last three months prior to the respective maturities of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the Notes converted. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes converted, we have the option to settle the excess with cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value, determined in accordance with the indenture, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 day observation period. The initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 62.1978 shares of our common stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which represents a 27.5 percent conversion premium from the date the Notes were issued and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.08 per share of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events as set forth in the indenture. In addition, if a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of Notes that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such fundamental change. 28 Table of Contents Subject to certain exceptions, if we undergo a designated event (as defined in the indenture) including a fundamental change, holders of the Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes. The designated event repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued interest up to but excluding the relevant repurchase date. We will pay cash for all Notes so repurchased. We may not redeem the Notes prior to maturity. In connection with the sale of the Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, on February 2, 2007 we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of the Notes and our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. We also have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earliest of (i) the date when all securities covered by the registration statement have been sold; (ii) the expiration of the applicable holding period with respect to the Notes and our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act of 1933, or any successor provision; and (iii) the date that is two years after the effective date of the registration statement. We may suspend the use of the registration statement to resell Notes or shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of Notes for reasons relating to pending corporate developments, public filings or other events. Subject to certain limitations, we will be required to pay the holders of the Notes special interest on the Notes if we fail to keep such registration statement effective during specified time periods. The Notes pay interest in cash at a rate of 1.75% semi annually in arrears on December 1 and June 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2007. Aggregate debt issuance costs of approximately $58.9 are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. A total of $2,200.0 of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes was used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our six month unsecured credit facility which was used to finance the acquisition of RSA. In connection with the sale of the Notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock (the Purchased Options). The Purchased Options allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to holders of the Notes upon conversion. The Purchased Options will cover, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of our common stock. Half of the Purchased Options expire on December 1, 2011 and the remaining half of the Purchased Options expire on December 1, 2013. We paid an aggregate amount of $669.1 of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the Purchased Options. We also entered into separate transactions in which we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of our common stock (the Sold Warrants) at an exercise price of approximately $19.55 per share of our common stock. Half of the Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 15, 2012 and March 15, 2012 and the remaining half of the Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 18, 2014 and March 18, 2014. We received aggregate proceeds of $391.1 from the sale of the Sold Warrants. The Purchased Options and Sold Warrants will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately $19.55 per share of our common stock, representing an approximate 55 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per share of our common stock on November 13, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense was $764.2, $640.0 and $616.4 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in each year was primarily attributable to intangible amortization expense associated with increased acquisition activity including the acquisitions of Smarts and Captiva in 2005 and RSA in 2006. Higher amortization expense associated with an increase in capitalized software development costs also contributed to the increase. A general growth in our property, plant and equipment balances in each year also resulted in greater depreciation expense. We have available for use a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. As of December 31, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the banks base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the covenants. We derive revenues from both selling and leasing activity. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any estimated exposure. Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that the combination of funds currently available, funds to be generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. 29 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years* 3 5 years** More than 5 years Operating leases $ 752.1 $ 193.4 $ 270.4 $ 127.7 $ 160.6 Long term convertible debt 3,450.0 1,725.0 1,725.0 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations 129.3 77.7 6.0 2.3 43.3 Purchase orders 1,478.2 882.7 595.5 Total $ 5,809.6 $ 1,153.8 $ 871.9 $ 1,855.0 $ 1,928.9 *Includes payments from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. **Includes payments from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space in most cases is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The long term convertible debt pertains to the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $57.7 as of December 31, 2006. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and or copyright. Most of these agreements in which we license our trademarks to another party require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time, we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. We have agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers of EMC and our subsidiaries to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. These indemnities vary in length of time. 30 Table of Contents Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2006, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2006 is not material. Notes and Accounts Receivable We derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. Litigation We are a party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Pension and Post Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plans We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans which were assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which cover substantially all former Data General employees located in the U.S. and Canada (the Pension Plans). The Pension Plans were frozen in 1999, resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for the Pension Plans are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 8.25%. This rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for the Pension Plans weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2006. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2006 was 7.05%. Based upon current market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2007 will remain at 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a $1.0 impact on the 2007 pension expense. As of December 31, 2006, the Pension Plans had a $100.5 accumulated actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 5.9%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated Aa or higher from a reputable rating agency. This rate represents the average of the discount rates for the Pension Plans weighted by plan liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.7 impact on the 2007 pension expense for the Pension Plans. Additionally, certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries and one of our foreign subsidiaries in Japan have defined benefit pension plans. These foreign pension plans are excluded from this discussion because they do not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the Data General acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. The plans assets are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plans assets is equal to the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on the plans assets for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 8.25%. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2006 was 7.05%. Based on current capital market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2007 will remain at 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense. As of December 31, 2006, the plan had $0.4 accumulated actuarial loss that will be recognized over the anticipated remaining years of service for participants. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 5.9%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated Aa or higher from a reputable rating agency. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition; Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables; Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition; FAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists; FAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases; and SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. We estimate systems warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific identification of system requirements. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. To the extent that our actual systems warranty costs differed from our estimates by 5 percent, consolidated pre tax income would have increased/decreased by approximately $10.0 in 2006. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level. The analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates. The estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2006, 2005, 2004 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated losses on the sale of real estate, employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions and negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. 32 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS No. 123R, which requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based upon the awards estimated grant date fair value. Previously, we elected to account for these share based payment awards under APB No. 25 and elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FAS No. 123R requires management to make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options and restricted stock awards, including the vesting or accelerated vesting for restricted stock awards containing performance based vesting features, the expected life of stock options and an estimate of future forfeitures. Changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of stock based compensation expense recognized, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Total pre tax stock based compensation expense recognized in 2006 was $409.4. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We are required to adopt FIN No. 48 effective as of January 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the effect FIN No. 48 will have on our financial statements. We do not expect the impact will be material. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157), which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. FAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and should be applied prospectively, except in the case of a limited number of financial instruments that require retrospective application. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of FAS No. 157 on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FAS 115 (FAS No. 159). The new statement allows entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that items fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. FAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of FAS No. 159 on our financial position and results of operations. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by BearMeasurisk as of December 31, 2006. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $0.5 million as of December 31, 2006 and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2005. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2006 and 2005 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2006 $ 0.7 $ 1.0 $ 0.5 2005 $ 0.7 $ 1.1 $ 0.2 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. A portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the BearMeasurisk dataset as of December 31, 2006. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $1.9 million as of December 31, 2006 and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2005. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2006 and 2005 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2006 $ 1.9 $ 2.3 $ 1.5 2005 $ 3.9 $ 6.3 $ 2.1 34 Table of Contents The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short and long term investments, accounts and notes receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer. We have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of the contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $41.5 million and $39.9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. 35 Table of Contents
