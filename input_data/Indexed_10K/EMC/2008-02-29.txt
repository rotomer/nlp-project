INTRODUCTION We manage our business in two broad categories: EMC Information Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure ("VMware"). Our EMC Information Infrastructure business consists of three of our segments: Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security. Our objective for our EMC Information Infrastructure business is to grow faster than the markets we serve by investing in the business for sustainable advantage while driving strong and expanding operating margins. Management believes that by providing a combination of systems, software, services and solutions to meet customers needs, we will be able to further profitably increase revenues. Our efforts over the past few years have been primarily focused on growing revenues by enhancing and expanding our portfolio of offerings to satisfy our customers information infrastructure requirements. We have enhanced and expanded our portfolio of offerings through both internal research and development ("R&D") and through acquisitions. We have increased our overall annual investment in R&D from $1,051.8 in 2005 to $1,339.7 in 2007. Additionally, we invested $3,862.8 on acquisitions collectively in 2005, 2006 and 2007. These R&D expenditures and acquisitions have enabled us to introduce new and enhanced offerings. We plan to continue our R&D efforts to enable further innovation so we can continue to introduce new and enhanced offerings and will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions. Revenue from new and enhanced product offerings introduced in the respective fiscal year, including all product revenues from companies acquired during that year, contributed $2,758.7 and $3,001.3 of revenue to 2007 and 2006, respectively. Concurrent with our objective of growing revenues, we are focused on controlling our costs. Beginning in 2006 and continuing throughout 2007, we continued our implementation of an integration plan for the EMC Information Infrastructure business including most of the acquisitions we had made over the prior three years. The objectives of the plan are to improve efficiencies across our EMC Information Infrastructure business and reduce costs, while helping us to present a more unified "One EMC" to our customers. The plan includes a workforce reduction of approximately 1,350 employees worldwide, consolidation of facilities, termination of contracts and abandoning of assets from which we will no longer derive a benefit. Once fully implemented, we believe the annualized recurring pre tax savings we will achieve from this plan is approximately $132.2, favorably impacting the three segments within our Information Infrastructure business. VMwares primary source of revenue is the licensing of virtualization software and related support and services through a variety of distribution channels for use by businesses and organizations of all sizes and across numerous industries in their information technology infrastructure. VMwares virtualization solutions run on industry standard desktops and servers and support a wide range of operating system and application environments, as well as networking and storage infrastructure. They have developed a multi channel distribution model to expand their presence and reach various segments of the market. In each of 2007, 2006 and 2005, VMware derived over 75% of revenues from channel partners, which include distributors, resellers, x86 systems vendors and system integrators. They have also developed a network of nearly 10,000 indirect channel partners who fulfill orders through direct channel partners. A majority of their revenue results from contracts that include both perpetual software licenses and ongoing software maintenance contracts. VMware has achieved significant revenue growth to date and is focused on extending growth by broadening their product portfolio, enabling choice for customers and driving standards, expanding their network of technology and distribution partners, increasing market awareness and promoting the adoption of virtualization. In addition to selling to new customers, VMware is also focused on expanding the use of their products within their existing customer base, as much of their license revenue is based on a per desktop or per server arrangement. VMware believes it is important that as they grow sales, they continue to invest in corporate infrastructure, including customer support, information technology and general and administrative functions. VMware expects spending in research and development to increase as they add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees 21 involved in product development and maintenance and continue to enable choice for customers and drive standards. VMware believes that equity incentives tied directly to the performance of VMware will help them compete for top level engineering and other talent. They also intend to continue to invest in hardware, networking and software tools to increase the efficiency of research and development efforts. VMwares current financial focus is on sustaining growth in revenue to generate cash flow to expand their market segment share and virtualization solutions. Although VMware is currently the leading provider of virtualization solutions, VMware believes the use of virtualization solutions is at very early stages by customers and expects to face competitive threats to their leadership from a number of companies, some of whom may have significantly greater resources than they do. As a result, they believe it is important to continue to invest in research and product development, sales and marketing and the support function to maintain or expand their leadership in the virtualization solutions market. This investment could result in contracting operating margins as VMware invests in their future. VMware believes that they will be able to continue to fund product development through operating cash flows as they continue to sell existing products and services. VMware believes this is the right priority for the long term health of their business. Our management is also focused on enhancing EMCs capital structure. In 2006, we issued $3,450.0 of long term senior unsecured obligations. We utilized $2,200.0 of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding indebtedness under a six month unsecured credit facility which was used to finance our acquisition of RSA. We utilized the majority of the remaining proceeds to purchase approximately 75.0 million shares of our common stock. From 2005 through 2007, we purchased 465.6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $6,112.5. During this time frame, we decreased our total outstanding shares by 12.6%. We plan to spend approximately $550.0 to purchase additional shares of our common stock during the first quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2007, we further enhanced our capital structure through the initial public offering ("IPO") of 37.95 million shares, or approximately 11%, of the capital stock of VMware. Also in the third quarter, VMware sold 9.5 million shares of its capital stock to Intel Capital Corporation. Net proceeds to VMware from these transactions were $1,253.5. EMC also sold 6.0 million shares of VMware Class A common stock held by us to Cisco Systems, Inc., resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $150.0. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues The following table presents revenue by our segments: Percentage Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs 2006 2006 vs 2005 Information Storage $ 10,610.9 $ 9,608.6 $ 8,792.2 10.4 % 9.3 % Content Management and Archiving 773.2 685.8 484.3 12.7 41.6 RSA Information Security 525.3 151.7 246.3 NM VMware Virtual Infrastructure 1,320.8 709.0 387.5 86.3 83.0 Total revenues $ 13,230.2 $ 11,155.1 $ 9,664.0 18.6 % 15.4 % NM not measurable The Information Storage segment revenues include systems, software license and services revenues. Systems revenues were $5,737.6, $5,124.8 and $4,486.9 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing increases of 12.0% in 2007 and 14.2% in 2006. The increases in systems revenues were due to greater demand for these products attributable to increased demand for our Information Technology ("IT") infrastructure offerings and a broadened product portfolio. Revenue from new and enhanced product offerings introduced in the respective fiscal year, including all product revenue from companies acquired during that year, contributed $2,262.5 and $2,720.0 of revenue to 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, revenue growth was driven by higher sales volumes from our channel partners. Our channel partners accounted for 57.8% and 106.5% of the revenue growth in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Software license revenues were $2,075.8, $2,015.3 and $2,005.9 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing increases of 3.0% in 2007 and 0.5% in 2006. Software license revenues increased in 2007 and 2006 when compared to the prior comparable period primarily due to higher demand for our backup recovery software and platform based software. The slower rate of software 22 license revenue growth compared to our systems growth is attributable to customers migrating to higher end systems but continuing to utilize their existing software licenses and increased lower end systems sales which utilize less software. Services revenues were $2,797.5, $2,468.5 and $2,299.4 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing increases of 13.3% in 2007 and 7.4% in 2006. Services revenues consist of software and hardware maintenance and professional services revenues. Services revenues increased in both 2007 and 2006 due to greater demand for our professional services as well as software and systems maintenance. Professional services accounted for 64.5% and 37.9% of the increase in services revenue for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Software and systems maintenance accounted for 35.5% and 62.1% of the increases in services revenues for 2007 and 2006, respectively. While professional services accounted for a larger proportion of the services revenue increase in 2007, a portion of this increase was attributable to acquisitions consummated in 2007 and 2006. Excluding the impact of 2007 and 2006 acquisitions, professional services accounted for 48.6% of the increase. The Content Management and Archiving segment revenues primarily include software license and services revenues. Software license revenues were $332.1, $323.6 and $228.7 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing increases of 2.6% in 2007 and 41.5% in 2006. The increase in software license revenues in 2007 and 2006 was attributable to greater demand for our content management offerings. The growth rate in 2007 was lower than 2006 primarily due to a consolidation of IT vendors who provide enterprise content management solutions. We believe this consolidation resulted in a short term pause in customer purchases. Additionally, we realigned our go to market model in the second quarter of 2007 which we also believe unfavorably impacted our revenues for the year. Software license revenues for 2006 were favorably impacted by $63.7 from the Captiva acquisition which was completed in December 2005. Revenue from new and enhanced product offerings introduced in the respective fiscal year, including all product revenues from companies acquired during that year, contributed $137.9 and $129.6 of revenue to 2007 and 2006, respectively. Services revenues were $435.8, $353.6 and $255.5 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing increases of 23.2% in 2007 and 38.4% in 2006. The increases in services revenues were attributable to greater demand for our professional services and higher software maintenance revenues. Professional services accounted for 58.4% and 37.8% of the increase in services revenues for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Software maintenance accounted for 41.6% and 62.2% of the increase in services revenues for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The RSA Information Security segment was created during the third quarter of 2006 as a result of our acquisitions of RSA and Network Intelligence Corporation in September 2006. Total revenues for 2007 and 2006 were $525.3 and $151.7, respectively, representing an increase of 246.3% for 2007. Revenue from new and enhanced product offerings introduced in the respective fiscal year, including all product revenues from companies acquired during that year, contributed $358.3 and $151.7 of revenue to 2007 and 2006, respectively. Because this segment was formed during the third quarter of 2006, the growth rate is not representative of future growth rates. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment includes software license and services revenues. Total revenues were $1,320.8, $709.0 and $387.5 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing an increase of 86.3% in 2007 and 83.0% in 2006. VMware sells its products through a network of direct channel partners, which includes distributors, resellers, x86 system vendors and systems integrators. More than 70% of the orders for each of the three years presented were generated through the 15 largest direct channel partners, including one distributor which represented 23%, 29% and 30% of revenue in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, another distributor and a channel partner accounted for 12% and 11% of revenues in 2007, respectively. As VMware expands geographically, they may add additional direct channel partners; however, approximately 90% of the increases in orders in 2007 and 2006 resulted from increased sales volumes through existing direct channel partners. VMware software license revenues were $903.2, $494.6 and $287.5 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing an increase of 82.6% in 2007 and 72.0% in 2006. The increases in software license revenues were the result of increased sales volume, driven largely by greater demand for virtualization product offerings attributable to wider market acceptance of virtualization as part of organizations IT infrastructure, a broadened product portfolio and expansion of VMwares network of indirect channel partners. Although VMware expects license revenue to continue to grow throughout 2008, VMware expects the rate of growth to decelerate due primarily to the size and scale of the business. VMware had nearly 10,000 indirect channel partners as of December 31, 2007, an increase of nearly 6,000 from December 31, 2006. Over 1,500 and 1,000 new indirect channel partners were added during 2006 and 2005, respectively. These indirect channel partners obtain software licenses and services from distributors and x86 system vendors and market and sell them to end user customers. In addition, VMware has a direct sales force that complements these efforts. The VMware sales force works with channel partners to introduce them to customers and new sales opportunities. These channel partners also introduce VMware sales force to their customers. 23 The percentage of orders greater than fifty thousand dollars in 2007, compared to 2006, increased modestly, while VMware experienced an increase in the percentage of orders greater than fifty thousand dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005. License orders from distributors and end user customers which were greater than fifty thousand dollars were approximately 32% of license revenues in 2007, approximately 30% of license revenues in 2006 and approximately 23% of license revenues in 2005. Although VMware remains a high volume transaction business, VMware believes an increase in the number of orders greater than fifty thousand dollars in the comparative periods is a result of broader acceptance of virtualization solutions for organizations IT infrastructure, a trend toward end user customers using VMware products broadly across their organizations, and a result of more customers entering into multi year enterprise license agreements. VMware anticipates this trend will continue. VMwares services revenues were $417.6, $214.4 and $99.9, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing an increase of 94.8% in 2007 and 114.6% in 2006. This growth reflects the increase in VMwares license revenues and renewals to customer contracts. Professional services revenues increased due to growing demand for design and implementation services and training programs, as end user organizations deployed virtualization across their organizations. Given the reasons cited above including the increased number of multi year enterprise license agreements, VMware expects that service revenue will comprise a larger proportion of their revenue mix and revenue growth in 2008. Revenues by geography were as follows: Percentage Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs 2006 2006 vs 2005 United States $ 7,343.0 $ 6,319.7 $ 5,468.6 16.2 % 15.6 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 3,921.1 3,232.6 2,743.8 21.3 17.8 Asia Pacific 1,400.0 1,126.2 1,061.2 24.3 6.1 Latin America, Mexico and Canada 566.1 476.6 390.3 18.8 22.1 Revenues increased in 2007 and 2006 in all of our markets due to greater demand for our products and services. Also contributing to the increases were revenues generated from the acquisitions consummated over the past three years. The lower growth rate in the Asia Pacific markets in 2006 was primarily attributable to lower levels of demand in Japan. Changes in exchange rates favorably impacted revenue growth by 2.3% in 2007 and adversely impacted revenue growth by 0.2% in 2006. The impact of the change in rates in 2007 was most significant in Europe, the Middle East and Africa market. The impact of the exchange in rates in 2006 was most significant in the Asia Pacific market, primarily Japan. Costs and expenses The 2007 and 2006 results include the effect of accounting for stock based compensation under Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 123R, "Shared Based Payment" ("FAS No. 123R"). As a result of this new standard, our 2007 and 2006 results of operations as compared to 2005 were impacted by a significant increase in stock based compensation expense. FAS No. 123R requires recognizing compensation costs for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based upon the awards estimated grant date fair value. The standard covers employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"). Additionally, we applied the provisions of the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107 on Share Based Payment to our adoption of FAS No. 123R. Previously, we elected to account for these share based payment awards under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"), and elected to only disclose the pro forma impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements. Total after tax stock based compensation expense, which consists of expense from employee stock options, ESPP, restricted stock awards and units, was $282.4 and $317.3 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. For periods prior to our adoption of FAS No. 123R, stock based compensation expense consisted of expense from restricted stock awards and the amortization of deferred compensation costs associated with stock options issued as consideration in various acquisitions. Accordingly, our financial results in 2005 were not prepared on a comparative basis to our financial results in 2007 and 2006. Total after tax stock based compensation expense in 2005 was $52.1. 24 The following table presents our costs and expenses, other income and net income. For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, and the capitalization and amortization of capitalized software development costs are considered corporate reconciling items and are not allocated among our various operating segments in preparing the segment operating performance measures utilized by our chief operating decision maker.

NM not measurable 25  Gross Margins Our overall gross margin percentages were 54.5% in 2007, 53.0% in 2006 and 53.7% in 2005. The improvement in the gross margin percentage in 2007 from 2006 was attributable to the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment which contributed 173 basis points, the RSA Information Security segment which contributed 56 basis points and the Content Management and Archiving segment which contributed 5 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by reductions in the Information Storage segment gross margin which decreased by 48 basis points. Corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and amortization of capitalized software development costs also decreased the consolidated gross margin by 36 basis points. The improvement in the gross margin percentage in 2006 from 2005 was attributable to the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment which contributed 102 basis points, the RSA Information Security segment which contributed 32 basis points and the Content Management and Archiving segment which contributed 22 basis points. The Information Storage segment negatively impacted gross margins by 119 basis points and corporate reconciling items decreased the gross margin by 109 basis points. For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and amortization of capitalized software development costs are recognized as corporate expenses and are not allocated among our various operating segments. The increase of $42.9 in corporate reconciling items in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to a $25.6 increase in intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions and a $26.4 increase in amortization of software development costs, offset by a $9.1 decrease in stock based compensation expense. The decrease in stock based compensation expense was due to higher valued options becoming fully vested in 2006. The increase in intangible asset amortization was driven by a $41.6 increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the RSA acquisition offset primarily by a $14.5 decrease in intangible asset amortization associated with the VMware, LEGATO and Documentum acquisitions. The increase in amortization of software development costs was due to an increase in the amount of unamortized software development costs which increased by $45.4 in 2007 and $48.7 in 2006 due to an increase in R&D activity which qualified for capitalization. The increase in corporate reconciling items of $114.2 in 2006 compared to 2005 is attributable to a $61.2 increase in stock based compensation, including $66.3 associated with the adoption of FAS No. 123R, greater amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs which increased by $31.3 and a $21.8 increase in intangible asset amortization associated with acquisitions. The gross margin percentages for the Information Storage segment were 51.8%, 52.2% and 53.5% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2007 was primarily attributable to the reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues to 19.6% in 2007 from 21.0% in 2006. Software license revenues provide a higher margin percentage than systems and services revenues. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2006 was primarily attributable to a reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues to 21.0% in 2006 from 22.8% in 2005. The gross margin percentages in the Content Management and Archiving segment were 67.6%, 68.6% and 70.1% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2007 was primarily attributable to a reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Software license revenues provide a higher gross margin percentage than services revenue. Software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues declined to 42.9% in 2007 from 47.2% in 2006. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2006 was primarily attributable to lower margins generated on our professional services business. Partially offsetting the decrease in the gross margin percentage was a 1.7% favorable impact from the Captiva acquisition which was completed in December 2005. The gross margin percentages for the RSA Information Security segment were 72.9% and 75.2% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Because the segment was formed in the last month of the third quarter of 2006, the change in the gross margin percentages is not meaningful. The VMware gross margin percentages were 88.3%, 88.6% and 90.4% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentages in all years was attributable to a reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Software license revenues provide a higher gross margin percentage than services revenues. Software license revenues were 68.4%, 69.8% and 74.2% of total segment revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 11.5%, 11.2% and 10.4% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. R&D expense increased $272.7 in 2007 and $249.4 in 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs, including salaries, benefits, recruiting, contract labor and consulting costs to support new product development and increased facility costs. Personnel related costs increased by $246.6 and $229.1 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Facility costs increased by $21.9 and $26.6 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. 26 Corporate reconciling items within R&D consist of stock based compensation, intangible asset amortization and the capitalization of software development costs. The benefit to R&D from the corporate reconciling items increased $43.4 in 2007 when compared to 2006 and decreased $51.4 in 2006 when compared to 2005. Stock based compensation increased $0.6 and $76.7 for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Intangible asset amortization decreased $1.2 in 2007 and increased $0.2 in 2006. The capitalization of software development costs increased by $42.8 and $25.5 for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2007 increase in stock based compensation expense consisted of a $15.9 decrease within EMCs Information Infrastructure business offset by a $16.5 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business. The decrease in stock based compensation within EMCs Information Infrastructure business in 2007 was primarily attributable to higher valued options that became fully vested in 2006. The increase in stock based compensation within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business was primarily attributable to grants of equity based compensation made in conjunction with VMwares initial public offering. The stock based compensation increase in 2006 consisted of a $65.0 increase within EMCs Information Infrastructure business plus an $11.7 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business. The 2006 increase in stock based compensation within both the EMC Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure businesses is largely attributable to incremental stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting FAS No. 123R which was $52.5. The change in intangible asset amortization in 2007 and 2006 was primarily attributable to the mix of intangible assets and their respective useful lives. The increase in capitalized software development costs in 2007 and 2006 resulted from the timing of projects reaching technological feasibility and the costs incurred subsequent to reaching technological feasibility. For segment reporting purposes, corporate reconciling items are not allocated to our various operating segments. R&D expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percent of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 11.2% in 2007 and 11.3% in each of 2006 and 2005. R&D expenses increased by $162.9 in 2007 and $125.0 in 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs and higher costs of facilities to support new product development. Personnel related costs increased by $148.0 and $97.1 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Costs of facilities, including depreciation increased by $15.9 and $12.1 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. R&D expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 22.9%, 21.1% and 19.8% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. R&D expenses increased by $153.2 in 2007 and $72.9 in 2006 primarily due to increased salaries, benefits, and consulting resulting from the deployment of additional resources to support new product development and other costs, including travel, facilities, expensed equipment and depreciation. Salaries, benefits and consulting expenses increased by $98.2 and $50.9 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The other costs increased by $31.4 and $10.4 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 29.6%, 29.2% and 27.0% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. SG&A expense increased $659.4 in 2007 and $647.3 in 2006 primarily due to increased personnel related costs, commissions, depreciation, travel and facilities costs to support the overall growth of the business. Personnel related costs, including commissions increased by $420.5 and $474.6, depreciation increased by $59.5 and $43.4, travel increased by $57.1 and $31.8 and facilities increased by $28.9 and $2.2 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, when compared to the comparable prior year. Corporate reconciling items within SG&A, which consist of stock based compensation and intangible asset amortization increased $4.6 and $197.9 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock based compensation decreased $22.8 in 2007 when compared to 2006 and increased $179.3 in 2006 when compared to 2005. Intangible asset amortization increased $27.4 and $18.6 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in stock based compensation expense in 2007 consisted of a $43.0 decrease within EMCs Information Infrastructure business offset by a $20.2 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business. The decrease in stock based compensation within EMCs Information Infrastructure business in 2007 was primarily attributable to higher valued options that became fully vested in 2006. The increase in stock based compensation within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business was primarily attributable to grants of equity based compensation made in conjunction with VMwares initial public offering. The increase in stock based compensation expense of $179.3 in 2006 within both EMC Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure was largely attributable to incremental stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting FAS No. 123R which was $131.9. The increase in intangible asset amortization was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets associated with the RSA acquisition by EMCs Information Infrastructure business in the third quarter of 2006. For segment reporting purposes, corporate reconciling items are not allocated to our various operating segments. SG&A expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues were 26.0%, 25.9% and 25.8% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. SG&A expenses increased by $389.8 and $312.8 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, depreciation and travel costs to support the 27 overall growth of the business. Personnel related costs increased by $262.7 and $217.8, depreciation increased by $51.8 and $37.4 and travel increased by $37.5 and $23.1 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, when compared to the comparable prior year. SG&A expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 41.1%, 39.3% and 36.6% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. SG&A expenses increased by $265.0 and $136.6 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, when compared to the comparable prior year primarily due to increase in sales, marketing and administrative personnel costs to support the growth of the business resulting from increased sales volume. Salaries and benefit costs increased $155.4 and $60.8 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Administrative costs, including travel, expensed equipment, facilities and depreciation increased $51.8 and $19.0 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, marketing programs increased by $12.9 in 2007 and $15.1 in 2006, respectively. In process Research and Development In process research and development ("IPR&D") was $1.2, $35.4 and $17.4 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The change in IPR&D in 2007 and 2006 as compared to the prior comparable year is attributable to the levels of in process R&D of acquisitions consummated during the respective periods. Restructuring Charges In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurred restructuring charges of $31.3, $162.6, and $84.2, respectively. The 2007 charge consists primarily of $21.5 to increase the severance expenses associated with the 2006 restructuring program and a $13.3 charge for employee termination benefits associated with a 2007 rebalancing program that is underway and will be completed in early 2008. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $3.2 associated with prior years restructuring programs. The 2006 charge consisted of $129.4 for employee termination benefits associated with a reduction in workforce, a $29.7 charge associated with abandoned assets for which we will no longer derive a benefit, a $5.7 charge associated with vacating excess facilities and a $10.9 charge for other contract terminations. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $13.1 associated with prior years restructuring programs. The 2005 charge consisted of $84.1 for employee termination benefits associated with workforce rebalancing and reductions in force efforts and $0.4 of costs associated with vacating excess facilities. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $0.3 associated with prior years restructuring programs. The activity for each charge is explained in the following sections. 2007 Restructuring Program The activity for the 2007 restructuring program is presented below: 2007 Category Initial Provision Utilization Ending Balance Non Cash Portion of the Provision Workforce reductions $ 13.3 $ (0.8 ) $ 12.4 $ 0.9 Total $ 13.3 $ (0.8 ) $ 12.4 $ 0.9 The 2007 restructuring program commenced in the fourth quarter of 2007 and included approximately 450 employees, of which approximately 185 employees remain to be terminated. These actions impacted the Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security segments. Approximately 72% of the affected employees were based in North America, excluding Mexico and 28% are or were based in Europe, Latin America, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region. 28 2006 Restructuring Programs The activity for the 2006 restructuring programs for 2007 and 2006 is presented below: 2007 Category Beginning Balance Adjustment to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 127.8 $ 21.5 $ (66.2 ) $ 83.2 Consolidation of excess facilities 5.5 (0.3 ) (2.7 ) 2.6 Contractual and other obligations 4.8 (4.8 ) Total $ 138.2 $ 21.2 $ (73.7 ) $ 85.7 2006 Category Initial Provision Utilization Ending Balance Non Cash Portion of the Provision Workforce reductions $ 129.4 $ (1.5 ) $ 127.8 $ 10.7 Asset impairment 29.7 (29.7 ) 29.7 Consolidation of excess facilities 5.7 (0.2 ) 5.5 Contractual and other obligations 10.9 (6.1 ) 4.8 Total $ 175.7 $ (37.5 ) $ 138.2 $ 40.4 The 2006 restructuring programs included a workforce reduction and covers approximately 1,350 employees worldwide. The workforce reductions objective is to further integrate EMC and the majority of the businesses we have acquired over the prior three years. These actions impacted the Information Storage and Content Management and Archiving segments across all major geographic regions. The adjustment to the provision in 2007 includes changes for finalizing severance agreements, particularly in international locations and estimated changes in severance amounts for employees yet to be terminated. The workforce reductions include $10.7 of non cash stock based compensation expense. The asset impairment charge of $29.7 consisted primarily of internal infrastructure projects that management decided to no longer pursue. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded its fair value, measured as the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows. Approximately 190 employees remain to be terminated. Substantially all actions are expected to be completed by March 31, 2008. The remaining cash portion owed for the 2006 restructuring is $76.5. The cash expenditures relating to workforce reductions are expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2008. The cash expenditures relating to consolidation of excess facilities are expected to be paid out through 2018. 2005 Restructuring Programs The activity for the 2005 restructuring programs for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is presented below: 2007 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 18.0 $ $ (17.6 ) $ 0.5 Consolidation of excess facilities 0.1 (0.1 ) Total $ 18.2 $ (0.1 ) $ (17.6 ) $ 0.5 2006 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 79.8 $ (2.3 ) $ (59.4 ) $ 18.0 Consolidation of excess facilities 0.1 0.1 Total $ 79.8 $ (2.2 ) $ (59.4 ) $ 18.2 29 2005 Category Initial Provision Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reductions $ 84.1 $ $ (4.4 ) $ 79.8 Consolidation of excess facilities 0.4 (0.4 ) Total $ 84.6 $ $ (4.8 ) $ 79.8 The 2005 restructuring programs included two separate reductions in force, one that commenced in the first quarter of 2005 and a second that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005, aggregating approximately 1,060 employees. These actions impacted the Information Storage and Content Management and Archiving segments across all major geographic regions. As of December 31, 2006, the restructuring programs had been substantially completed. The adjustment to the provision in 2006 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the original number of individuals identified for termination and lower than expected severance benefits. Prior Year Restructuring Programs Prior to 2005, we had instituted several restructuring programs. The activity for these programs for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 is presented below: 2007 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 1.2 $ $ (0.3 ) $ 0.8 Consolidation of excess facilities 40.1 (3.1 ) (11.2 ) 25.7 Other contractual obligations 1.9 0.2 (1.2 ) 0.8 Total $ 43.2 $ (3.0 ) $ (12.8 ) $ 27.3 2006 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 7.0 $ (2.7 ) $ (3.2 ) $ 1.2 Consolidation of excess facilities 65.4 (8.5 ) (16.8 ) 40.1 Other contractual obligations 2.4 0.3 (0.7 ) 1.9 Total $ 74.8 $ (10.9 ) $ (20.8 ) $ 43.2 2005 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 19.7 $ (1.7 ) $ (10.9 ) $ 7.0 Consolidation of excess facilities 92.9 1.6 (29.2 ) 65.4 Other contractual obligations 2.6 (0.2 ) 2.4 Total $ 115.3 $ (0.3 ) $ (40.1 ) $ 74.8 The reductions to the provisions in 2007 and 2006 for excess facilities were a result of lower than expected costs associated with vacating leased facilities. The prior year restructuring programs impacted the Information Storage and Content Management and Archiving segments. The remaining liability for the consolidation of excess facilities is expected to be paid through 2015. As we continue to refine our business model, we will reassess our cost structure and asset deployment to assess whether additional changes are necessary. Should we determine that additional restructuring programs will benefit our business, we may incur additional charges. If customer demand for products changes, we may be required to write down the value of assets. Additionally, changes in our business model or market conditions could cause goodwill or other assets to be impaired. 30  Gain on Sale of VMware Stock to Cisco The gain on sale of VMware stock for the year ended December 31, 2007 consists of a $148.6 gain on the sale of 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock of VMware held by EMC sold to Cisco for proceeds of approximately $150.0. Investment Income Investment income was $249.3, $224.9 and $190.4 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Investment income increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher average outstanding cash and investment balances and lower realized losses on investments. Investment income increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to greater yields on investments and lower realized losses on investments, partially offset by lower average outstanding cash and investment balances due to a significant increase in repurchases of our common stock in the open market when compared to 2005. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains and losses, was 4.3%, 4.2% and 3.4% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net realized losses were $10.1, $27.8 and $58.9 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense was $72.9, $34.1 and $8.0 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual increases in interest expense were primarily due to higher debt balances. In September 2006, we borrowed $2,200.0 under a six month unsecured credit facility to finance the acquisition of RSA. In November 2006, we completed the issuance of our $1,725.0 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes") and our $1,725.0 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes" and, together with the 2011 Notes, the "Notes"). A portion of the proceeds from the Notes was used to repay in full the $2,200.0 of outstanding indebtedness under the aforementioned unsecured credit facility. Interest expense in 2005 was primarily attributable to interest associated with our $125.0 4.5% Senior Convertible Notes due April 1, 2007, which were assumed in connection with the Documentum (the "Documentum Notes") acquisition. The Documentum Notes were redeemed in April 2006. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $4.7, $8.6 and $10.6 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in other expense in both 2007 and 2006 as compared to the comparable prior period was primarily attributable to reductions in foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 18.4%, 11.7% and 31.4% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the United States. In 2007, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 14.5 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. We had a reduction in our valuation allowance which principally arose from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards towards the capital gain on the sale of VMware stock to Cisco, resulting in a benefit to our effective tax rate of 1.5 percentage points. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 1.2 percentage points. The net effect of non deductible permanent differences, state taxes, tax credits and other items was an increase to the rate of 0.6 percentage points. In 2006, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 13.9 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 12.4 percentage points. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances collectively had a negative impact on the rate of 3.0 percentage points, driven principally by non deductible permanent differences. In 2005, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 8.3 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax 31 rate by an additional 9.9 percentage points. Our income tax rate was increased by 10.9 percentage points resulting from repatriating approximately $3,000 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"). The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances collectively had a negative impact on the rate of 3.7 percentage points, driven principally by non deductible permanent differences. Minority Interest in VMware, net of taxes As a result of VMwares IPO in the third quarter of 2007, VMware is no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of EMC. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized minority interest expense of $15.5. On December 31, 2007, the minority interest was approximately 15%. Financial Condition Cash provided by operating activities was $3,126.6 in 2007, $2,140.4 in 2006 and $2,216.3 in 2005. Cash received from customers was $13,333.5, $11,167.2 and $9,732.8 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual increases were attributable to higher sales volume and greater cash proceeds from the sale of maintenance contracts. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $10,182.6, $8,666.6 and $7,539.9 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual increases were partially attributable to higher headcount. Total headcount was approximately 37,700, 31,100 and 26,500 at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The headcount increases were due to general growth of the business, as well as acquisition activity in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Inventory increased from $834.8 at December 31, 2006 to $877.2 at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory levels for new products to support the overall growth of the business. Cash received from dividends and interest was $254.1, $258.6 and $249.2 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash paid for interest was $76.0, $26.8 and $9.1 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual increases were primarily attributable to interest payments made on the Notes. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid $202.3, $592.1 and $216.7, respectively, in income taxes. These payments are comprised of estimated taxes for the current year, extension payments for the prior year and refunds or payments associated with income tax filings and tax audits. Despite higher pre tax income, cash paid for income taxes decreased from 2006 to 2007, principally due to increased deductions for stock based compensation, increased Federal R&D credits arising from a change in law and increased utilization of acquired net operating losses. The increase from 2005 to 2006 was principally due to a combination of higher pre tax income, the repatriation of funds under the AJCA and a reduction in the amount of net operating losses and tax credits available to reduce our taxable income. Cash used for investing activities was $1,162.9, $2,296.7 and $611.7 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $692.0, $2,618.4 and $683.7, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital additions were $699.0, $718.1 and $601.1 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in capital spending in 2006 when compared to 2005 was attributable to various IT initiatives to further integrate our acquisitions to enable us to more effectively service our growing customer base and to support the overall growth of the business. Capitalized software development costs were $232.0, $192.9 and $167.1 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual increases in software development costs were due to increased development efforts across all of our segments. Net sales (purchases) and maturities of investments were $322.4, $1,253.6 and $868.4 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This activity varies from year to year based upon our cash collections, cash requirements and maturity dates of our investments. During 2007, we received $150.0 in net proceeds from the sale to Cisco of 6.0 million shares of VMwares Class A common stock held by us. Cash provided (used) for financing activities was $679.5, ($392.0) and ($743.6) in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our Board of Directors has currently authorized the repurchase of 250 million shares of our common stock. In 2007, we repurchased 89.4 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $1,453.7. Of the 250 million shares authorized for repurchase, we have cumulatively repurchased 199.2 million shares at a total cost of $2,660.8, leaving a remaining balance of 50.8 million shares authorized for future repurchases. Additionally, in 2006, the Board also authorized a one time repurchase of shares in conjunction with our issuance of the Notes of which 75.0 million shares were repurchased using $945.8 of the net proceeds from the Notes. In total we spent $1,453.7, $3,655.4 and $1,003.4 on repurchases in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We plan to spend approximately $550.0 on common stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2008; however, the number of shares purchased and timing of our purchases will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the price of our stock, market conditions, our cash position and alternative demands for our cash resources. Proceeds from the sale of VMwares Class A common stock in its IPO and to Intel were $1,253.5. We generated $782.4, $257.8 and $263.3 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from the exercise of stock options. Proceeds from short and long term obligations were $19.8, $5,654.0 and $0.2 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In September 2006, we borrowed $2,200.0 under a six month unsecured credit facility to finance the acquisition of RSA. In November 2006, we also closed the sale of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes for an aggregate amount of $3,450.0. Total payments of short and long term obligations were $17.2, $2,331.6 and $3.7 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, we repaid $2,200.0 32 to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under our six month unsecured credit facility which was used to finance the acquisition of RSA and $126.1 paid to redeem the outstanding principal balance of the Documentum Notes. In November 2006, we issued our 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes for total gross proceeds of $3,450.0. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of liabilities of our subsidiaries was approximately $2.5 billion, excluding intercompany liabilities. Holders may convert their Notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding (i) September 1, 2011, with respect to the 2011 Notes, and (ii) September 1, 2013, with respect to the 2013 Notes, in each case only under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the price per Note of the applicable series for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day or at least $20.90 per share; (2) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter or (3) upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Notes. Additionally, the Notes will become convertible during the last three months prior to the respective maturities of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the Notes converted. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes converted, we have the option to settle the excess with cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value, determined in accordance with the indenture, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 day observation period. The initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 62.1978 shares of our common stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which represents a 27.5 percent conversion premium from the date the Notes were issued and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.08 per share of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events as set forth in the indenture. In addition, if a "fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of Notes that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such fundamental change. Subject to certain exceptions, if we undergo a "designated event" (as defined in the indenture) including a "fundamental change," holders of the Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes. The designated event repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus any accrued interest up to but excluding the relevant repurchase date. We will pay cash for all Notes so repurchased. We may not redeem the Notes prior to maturity. In connection with the sale of the Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, on February 2, 2007 we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of the Notes and our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. We also have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earliest of (i) the date when all securities covered by the registration statement have been sold; (ii) the expiration of the applicable holding period with respect to the Notes and our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act of 1933, or any successor provision; and (iii) the date that is two years after the effective date of the registration statement. We may suspend the use of the registration statement to resell Notes or shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of Notes for reasons relating to pending corporate developments, public filings or other events. Subject to certain limitations, we will be required to pay the holders of the Notes special interest on the Notes if we fail to keep such registration statement effective during specified time periods. The Notes pay interest in cash at a rate of 1.75% semi annually in arrears on December 1 and June 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2007. Aggregate debt issuance costs of approximately $58.9 are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. A total of $2,200.0 of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes was used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under a six month unsecured credit facility which was used to finance the acquisition of RSA. In connection with the sale of the Notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock (the "Purchased Options"). The Purchased Options allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to holders of the Notes upon conversion. The Purchased Options will cover, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of our common stock. Half of the 33 Purchased Options expire on December 1, 2011 and the remaining half of the Purchased Options expire on December 1, 2013. We paid an aggregate amount of $669.1 of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the Purchased Options. We also entered into separate transactions in which we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of our common stock (the "Sold Warrants") at an exercise price of approximately $19.55 per share of our common stock. Half of the Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 15, 2012 and March 15, 2012 and the remaining half of the Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 18, 2014 and March 18, 2014. We received aggregate proceeds of $391.1 from the sale of the Sold Warrants. The Purchased Options and Sold Warrants will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately $19.55 per share of our common stock, representing an approximate 55 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per share of our common stock on November 13, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense was $917.3, $764.2 and $640.0 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in each year was primarily attributable to intangible asset amortization expense which increased by $51.8 and $40.2 in 2007 and 2006, respectively associated with increased acquisition activity. Higher amortization expense associated with an increase in capitalized software development costs contributed $26.4 and $31.2 in 2007 and 2006, respectively to the increase. A general growth in our property, plant and equipment balances in each year also resulted in greater depreciation expense of $74.9 and $52.7 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, our total cash, cash equivalents, and short term and long term investments were $7,952. This balance includes $1,231.2 held by VMware and $2,628.0 held by EMC in overseas entities. We held approximately $972.5 of auction rate securities at December 31, 2007. We believe none of these investments has been impaired during the recent sub prime mortgage market crisis. Our investments in auction rate securities consist of municipal debt obligations. None of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed or collateralized debt obligations. Since year end, we have liquidated approximately $605.0 of these securities and received the principal we invested. We have attempted to liquidate an additional portion of these investments but have not been able to do so due to a lack of liquidity in the market for such securities. The continued uncertainty in the credit markets has prevented us and other investors from liquidating our holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of orders. In the event that we need to monetize these investments in the future, we may not be able to do so until a future auction is successful, the issuer redeems the outstanding securities or the securities mature. For all of our auction rate securities, the underlying maturity date is in excess of one year. If an issuer of the securities is unable to successfully close future auctions and its credit rating deteriorates or adverse developments occur in the bond insurance market, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our auction rate securities through a future impairment charge. Based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments, our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or working capital. We have available for use a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. As of December 31, 2007, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the banks base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants. We derive revenues from both selling and leasing activity. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any estimated exposure. Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that the combination of funds currently available, funds to be generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. 34 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years* 3 5 years** More than 5 years Operating leases $ 1,103.7 $ 214.5 $ 323.8 $ 157.3 $ 408.1 Long term convertible debt 3,450.0 1,725.0 1,725.0 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations 127.6 77.4 3.5 1.5 45.2 Purchase orders 1,515.1 1,465.3 49.8 Uncertain tax positions 1.2 1.2 Total $ 6,197.6 $ 1,758.4 $ 2,102.1 $ 1,883.8 $ 453.3 *Includes payments from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011. **Includes payments from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2007, EMC had $206.7 of non current liabilities for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48. We do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space in most cases is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The long term convertible debt pertains to the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $65.3 as of December 31, 2007. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and or copyright. Most of these agreements in which we license our trademarks to another party require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time, we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. 35 We have agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers of EMC and our subsidiaries to the extent legally permissible against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2007, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2007 is not material. Notes and Accounts Receivable We derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any estimated exposure. Litigation We are a party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Pension and Post Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plans We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans which were assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which cover substantially all former Data General employees located in the U.S. and Canada (the "Pension Plans"). The Pension Plans were frozen in 1999, resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for the Pension Plans are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 8.25%. This rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for the Pension Plans weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2007. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2007 was 6.0%. Based upon current market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2008 will remain at 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a $1.0 impact on the 2008 pension expense. As of December 31, 2007, the Pension Plans had a $72.7 accumulated actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 6.55%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated Aa or higher from a reputable rating agency. This rate represents the average of the discount rates for the Pension Plans weighted by plan liabilities as of December 31, 2007. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.8 impact on the 2008 pension expense for the Pension Plans. Additionally, certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries and one of our foreign subsidiaries in Japan have defined benefit pension plans. These foreign pension plans are excluded from this discussion because they do not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the Data General acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. The plans assets are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plans assets is equal to the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on the plans assets for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 8.25%. The actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2007 was 6.0%. Based on current capital market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2008 will remain at 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense. As of December 31, 2007, the plan had $0.2 accumulated actuarial loss that will be recognized over the anticipated remaining years of service for participants. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 6.55%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated Aa or higher from a reputable rating agency. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense. 36  In December 2007, we settled the liability associated with the retiree life insurance plan by transferring the liability to a third party. The impact of this settlement on our results of operations was not material. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including SAB No. 104, "Revenue Recognition"; Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"; Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition"; FAS No. 48, "Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists"; FAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases"; and SOP No. 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts," among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. We estimate systems warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific identification of system requirements. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. To the extent that our actual systems warranty costs differed from our estimates by 5 percent, consolidated pre tax income would have increased/decreased by approximately $11.6 in 2007. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The market value of our short and long term investments is based upon the listed price of the security. In the event the security is not listed, our investment advisors assess a variety of factors to determine the market value, including market values from recent transactions at which the security traded, the value of similar securities and pricing models. We perform independent verifications of all of our holdings throughout the year. In the event this value differs significantly from the value determined by our investment advisors, we assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. In the event the fair market values that we determine are not accurate or we are unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner, we may not realize the recorded value of our investments. We may hold investments whose market value is below our cost. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in 37 judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. The valuation of goodwill is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level. The analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates. The estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2007, 2006, 2005 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated losses on the sale of real estate, employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions and negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. Accounting for Stock based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS No. 123R, which requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based upon the awards estimated grant date fair value. Previously, we elected to account for these share based payment awards under APB No. 25 and elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FAS No. 123R requires management to make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options and restricted stock awards, including the vesting or accelerated vesting for restricted stock awards containing performance based vesting features, the expected life of stock options and an estimate of future forfeitures. Changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of stock based compensation expense recognized, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS No. 157"), which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. FAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and should be applied prospectively, except in the case of a limited number of financial instruments that require retrospective application. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the implementation of FAS No. 157 for certain non financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of FAS No. 157 on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FAS 115" ("FAS No. 159"). The new statement allows entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that items fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. FAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of FAS No. 159 on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("FAS No. 141R"). This statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination (i) recognizes and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, and 38 (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of FAS No. 141R on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51" ("FAS No. 160"). The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and therefore deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of FAS No. 160 on our financial position and results of operations. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by BearMeasurisk as of December 31, 2007. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $1.0 million as of December 31, 2007 and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2006. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2007 and 2006 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2007 $ 0.8 $ 1.0 $ 0.6 2006 $ 0.7 $ 1.0 $ 0.5 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. 39 Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. A portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the BearMeasurisk dataset as of December 31, 2007. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $2.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2006. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2007 and 2006 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2007 $ 0.7 $ 2.4 $ (0.5 ) 2006 $ 1.9 $ 2.3 $ 1.5 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short and long term investments, accounts and notes receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer. We have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis. Under these securities lending agreements, the value of the collateral is equal to 102% of the fair market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is generally cash, U.S. government backed securities or letters of credit. At December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding securities lending transactions. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of the contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $35.9 million and $41.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. 40
