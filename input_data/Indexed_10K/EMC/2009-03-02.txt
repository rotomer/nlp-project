The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. The forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, securities offerings or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof.  All dollar amounts expressed numerically in this MD&A are in millions, except per share amounts. Certain tables may not add due to rounding. INTRODUCTION We manage our business in two broad categories: EMC Information Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure. EMC Information Infrastructure Our EMC Information Infrastructure business consists of three of our segments: Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security. Our objective for our EMC Information Infrastructure business is to grow faster than the markets we serve by investing in the business for sustainable advantage. To further improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global business in response to a challenging global economy, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we implemented a restructuring program to further streamline the costs related to our Information Infrastructure business. We expect the program to reduce costs from our 2008 rate by approximately $350 in 2009, increasing to approximately $500 in 2010. The programs focus is to consolidate back office functions, field and campus offices, rebalance investments towards higher growth products and markets, reduce management layers, and further reduce indirect spend on contractors, third party services and travel. The restructuring program will reduce our global Information Infrastructure workforce by approximately 2,400 positions. The program is expected to favorably impact our cost of sales, selling, general & administrative ("SG&A") and research & development ("R&D") expenses. For 2009, we estimate that approximately a third of these reductions will be to our cost of sales and the remaining two thirds will be to our other operating expenses. The programs expected savings will come from both cost reductions and the transformation of several areas of our operational cost structure. As part of the program, we are undertaking several initiatives to transform the structural efficiency of our operations worldwide. These initiatives will include the consolidation and movement of various facilities and processes beginning in 2009 and to be completed by the end of 2010. As part of these transformation efforts, we expect to incur additional non recurring costs of approximately $75 to $100 over this period. These investments are necessary to implement the new, more efficient capabilities ahead of transitioning from the existing cost structure. As a result of the program, we recognized a restructuring charge of $247.9 in the fourth quarter of 2008. We expect to record additional restructuring charges of approximately $100 to $125 across 2009 and 2010. We expect the global economic situation to have a negative impact on IT spending in 2009. Our best estimate is that 2009 global IT spending will decline as a percentage in the mid to high single digits compared with 2008. We expect the markets that we address will perform slightly better than the overall IT market. We also expect that a higher than usual percentage of the full year IT spending will take place in the second half of the year. VMware Virtual Infrastructure Our VMware Virtual Infrastructure business has achieved significant revenue growth to date by focusing on delivering new virtual infrastructure software solutions technology and products, expanding its network of technology and distribution partners, increasing product awareness, promoting the adoption of virtualization and building long term relationships with its customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements. 22 Table of Contents The current financial focus of VMware is on revenue growth to generate cash flows to fund its expansion of industry segment share and development of virtualization based products for data centers, desktops and cloud computing. VMware expects to continue its revenue growth by broadening its virtual infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio. Although VMware is currently the leading provider of virtual infrastructure solutions, management believes the use of virtual infrastructure solutions is at early stages by customers. The business faces competitive threats to its leadership from a number of companies, some of which have significantly greater resources, which could result in increased pressure to reduce prices on its offerings. As a result, management believes it is important to continue to invest in strategic initiatives related to product research and development, market expansion and associated support functions to expand industry leadership. These investments could result in contracting operating margins as VMware invests in its future. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues The following table presents revenue by our segments: Percentage Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs 2007 2007 vs 2006 Information Storage $ 11,632.3 $ 10,610.9 $ 9,608.6 9.6 % 10.4 % Content Management and Archiving 785.6 773.2 685.8 1.6 12.7 RSA Information Security 581.3 525.3 151.7 10.7 246.3 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 1,876.9 1,320.8 709.0 42.1 86.3 Total revenues $ 14,876.2 $ 13,230.2 $ 11,155.1 12.4 % 18.6 % The Information Storage segment revenues include systems, software and other services revenues. Systems revenues were $6,281.6, $5,737.6 and $5,124.8 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing an increase of 9.5% in 2008 and 12.0% in 2007. The increases in systems revenues were due to greater demand for these products attributable to increased demand for our IT infrastructure offerings and a broadened product portfolio. Software revenues were $3,170.5, $3,078.0 and $2,941.2 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing an increase of 3.0% and 4.7% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 increase of 3.0% was due to an $186.4 or 18.6% increase in software maintenance revenues, partially offset by a decrease in software license revenues of $93.9 or 4.5%. Software maintenance revenues increased due to continued demand for support from our installed base. The decline in software license revenues was due to a combination of factors, including existing systems customers migrating to higher end systems while continuing to utilize their existing software licenses and increased lower end systems sales which utilize less software. The 2007 increase of 4.7% was due to a $76.3 or 8.2% increase in software maintenance revenues and a $60.5 or 3.0% increase in software license revenues. Software maintenance revenues increased due to continued demand for support from our installed base. Software license revenue increased when compared to the prior comparable period due to demand for our backup recovery software and platform based software. Total other services revenues were $2,180.2, $1,795.3 and $1,542.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing an increase of 21.4% in 2008 and 16.4% in 2007. Other services primarily consist of professional services and system maintenance. Professional services increased $278.6 or 22.7% and $208.3 or 20.5% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and system maintenance revenues increased $89.1 or 17.7% and $36.6 or 7.8% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in professional services was partially attributable to greater demand for our professional services, largely to support and implement information lifecycle management based solutions and to acquisitions consummated in 2007 and 2008. Acquisitions in 2008 contributed 300 basis points to the 2008 increase in revenues and acquisitions in 2007 contributed 68 basis points to the 2007 increase in revenues. System maintenance increased due to greater demand for our information storage systems. Total Information Storage revenue growth was also driven by higher sales volume from our channel partners. Our channel partners accounted for 27.2% and 57.8% of the revenue growth in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Content Management and Archiving segment revenues primarily include software revenues and other services revenues. Total software revenues were $580.6, $585.0 and $542.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.8% in 2008 and an increase of 7.8% in 2007. The 0.8% decrease in 2008 software revenues was primarily due to a decrease in software license revenues of $57.0 or 17.2%, partially offset by an increase in software maintenance revenues of $52.6 or 20.8%. The decrease in software license revenues was attributable to lower demand for application software resulting from the current uncertain economic climate and resulting negative impact in our customers IT 23 Table of Contents purchases. Software maintenance revenues increased due to continued demand for support from our installed base. The 7.8% increase in software revenues in 2007 was due to an increase in software maintenance revenue of $33.9 or 15.5% and an increase in software license revenues of $8.5 or 2.6%. Software maintenance revenues increased due to continued demand for support from our installed base. The increase in software license revenues in 2007 was attributable to greater demand for our content management offerings. Other services revenues increased $19.1 or 10.5% and $48.2 or 35.8% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of increased demand for professional services to support and implement solutions for managing increasing volumes of customers unstructured data. The RSA Information Security segment was created during the third quarter of 2006 as a result of our acquisitions of RSA and Network Intelligence Corporation in September 2006. The RSA Information Security segment revenues primarily include software revenues and other services revenues. Total software revenues were $461.6, $438.7 and $127.3 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing an increase of 5.2% in 2008 and 244.6% in 2007. The 5.2% increase in 2008 was primarily due to an increase in software maintenance revenues of $26.4 or 27.0%, partially offset by a decrease in software license revenues of $3.5 or 1.0%. Software maintenance revenues increased due to continued demand for support from our installed base. The decrease in software license revenues in 2008 was attributable to lower demand resulting from the current uncertain economic climate and resulting negative impact in our customers IT purchases. Other services revenues increased $32.4 or 46.7% and $52.3 or 305.1% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of increased demand for professional services. Because this segment was formed during the third quarter of 2006, the 2007 growth rate is not representative of the actual ongoing growth rate. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment includes software license revenues and services revenues. Total revenues were $1,876.9, $1,320.8 and $709.0 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing an increase of 42.1% in 2008 and 86.3% in 2007. Software license revenues were $1,175.1, $903.2 and $494.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing an increase of 30.1% in 2008 and 82.6% in 2007. A significant majority of the revenue growth in 2008 and 2007 when compared to the prior comparable period is the result of greater demand for VMwares virtualization product offerings attributable to wider industry acceptance of virtualization as part of organizations IT infrastructure, a broadened product portfolio and expansion of VMwares network of indirect channel partners. ELAs continue to be a significant component of VMwares revenue growth. Under a typical ELA, a portion of the revenue is attributed to the license and recognized immediately, but the majority is deferred and recognized as services revenue in future periods. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2008, VMware observed seasonal strength in ELAs from its enterprise accounts and comparative weakness in the transactional business especially with price sensitive customers, such as the academic market and smaller businesses. During the second half of the year, customers began purchasing VMware solutions in smaller quantities through the channel to meet their immediate needs, forgoing larger discounts offered under ELAs. VMware expects that customers may continue smaller purchases through the channel at least through the first quarter of 2009 and perhaps longer. VMware expects the rate of revenue growth to continue to decelerate due primarily to the size and scale of its business and lengthened sales cycles attributable to challenges its customers may face in the current uncertain economic environment, such as decreases in IT budgets and difficulties in obtaining financing. VMware software maintenance and services revenues were $701.9, $417.6 and $214.4 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing an increase of 68.1% in 2008 and 94.8% in 2007. Software maintenance and services revenues primarily consist of software maintenance and professional services revenues. This growth reflects the increase in VMwares license revenues, as software maintenance services are generally purchased with licenses, the benefit from multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods and renewals of existing customer software maintenance contracts. Professional services revenue growth reflects increased demand for design and implementation services and training programs, as end user organizations deployed virtualization across their organizations. Given the reasons cited previously, VMware expects that services revenue will compose a larger proportion of its revenue mix and revenue growth in 2009. Revenues by geography were as follows: Percentage Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs 2007 2007 vs 2006 United States $ 7,990.8 $ 7,343.0 $ 6,319.7 8.8 % 16.2 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,555.0 3,921.1 3,232.6 16.2 21.3 Asia Pacific 1,640.1 1,400.0 1,126.2 17.2 24.3 Latin America, Mexico and Canada 690.3 566.1 476.6 21.9 18.8 24 Table of Contents Revenue increased in 2008 and 2007 in all of our markets due to greater demand for our products and services. Changes in exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue growth of 0.8% and 2.3% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The impact of the change in rates in both periods was most significant in the European market, primarily: Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom; and Japan. Costs and expenses The following table presents our costs and expenses, other income and net income. For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation and acquisition related intangible asset amortization are considered corporate reconciling items and are not allocated among our various operating segments in preparing the segment operating performance measures utilized by our chief operating decision maker.

NM not measurable 25 Table of Contents Gross Margins Overall, our gross margin percentages were 55.3%, 54.5% and 53.0% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The improvement in the gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 was attributable to the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment, which contributed 123 basis points and the Information Storage segment, which contributed 21 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by the margin impact of the Content Management and Archiving segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 19 basis points and the RSA Information Security segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 1 basis point. The increase in corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation and acquisition related intangible asset amortization decreased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 44 basis points. The improvement in the gross margin percentage in 2007 compared to 2006 was attributable to the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment, which contributed 163 basis points, and the RSA Information Security segment, which contributed 54 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by the margin impact of the Information Storage segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 50 basis points and the Content Management and Archiving segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 4 basis points. The increase in corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation and acquisition related intangible asset amortization decreased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 13 basis points. For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation and acquisition related intangible asset amortization are recognized as corporate expenses and are not allocated among our various operating segments. The increase of $61.5 in the corporate reconciling items in 2008 was attributable to a $38.6 increase in intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions and a $22.9 increase in stock based compensation expense, primarily attributable to VMware equity grants. The increase of $16.6 in the corporate reconciling items in 2007 was attributable to a $25.6 increase in intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, partially offset by a $9.0 decrease in stock based compensation expense. The $9.0 decrease in stock based compensation expense was due to higher valued options becoming fully vested in 2006. The gross margin percentages for the Information Storage segment were 51.3%, 50.6% and 50.9% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to our ability to achieve higher gross margins from our focus on selling overall solutions to our customers, partially offset by the margin impact from the acquisition of Iomega in June of 2008. The acquisition of Iomega reduced gross margins by 70 basis points for 2008. Iomega operates within the consumer and small business marketplace which historically has had lower gross margins than our traditional Information Storage segment. The decrease in gross margin percentage in 2007 was primarily attributable to the reduction in the mix of software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues to 19.6% in 2007 from 21.0% in 2006. Software license revenues generally provide a higher margin percentage than systems and services revenues. The gross margin percentages for the Content Management and Archiving segment were 61.1%, 64.9% and 67.1% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decreases in the gross margin percentage for both 2008 and 2007 were primarily attributable to a decline in software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 47.2% in 2006 to 42.9% in 2007 and to 35.0% in 2008. Software license revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than software maintenance and other services revenues. The gross margin percentages for the RSA Information Security segment were 70.6%, 72.5% and 75.2% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decreases in the gross margin percentage in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to a decrease in software license revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 68.5% in 2006 to 64.9% in 2007 and to 58.0% in 2008. Software license revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than software maintenance and other services revenues. The gross margin percentages for the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment were 85.7% in 2008, 85.7% in 2007 and 85.5% in 2006. The consistency in the gross margin percentage in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to consistent software license and maintenance revenue mix as a percentage of total revenues. Software license and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from 93.2% in 2007 to 92.2% in 2008 and from 93.3% in 2006 to 93.2% in 2007. 26  Table of Contents Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 11.6%, 11.5% and 11.2% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. R&D expenses increased $194.4 and $272.7 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, including salaries, benefits, recruiting, contract labor and consulting and higher cost of facilities. Personnel related costs increased by $218.5 and $261.6 and the cost of facilities increased by $26.4 and $21.9 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in capitalized software development costs of $59.9 and $42.7 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, which reduced R&D costs. Additionally, we experienced a reduction in the cost of materials to support new product development of $13.2 and $18.4 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Corporate reconciling items within R&D consist of stock based compensation and intangible asset amortization. These costs increased $56.0 to $175.4 in 2008 and decreased $0.7 to $119.4 in 2007. In 2008, stock based compensation expense increased $54.4 and intangible asset amortization increased $1.6. The increase in stock based compensation expense consisted of a $35.6 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business and an $18.8 increase within EMCs Information Infrastructure business. The increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to incremental VMware equity grants made in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, intangible asset amortization decreased $1.3 and stock based compensation expense increased $0.6. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2007 consisted of a $16.5 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business offset by a $15.9 decrease within EMCs Information Infrastructure business. The increase in stock based compensation expense within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business was attributable to incremental equity grants made in 2007. The decrease in stock based compensation expense within EMCs Information Infrastructure business was primarily attributable to higher valued options becoming fully vested in 2006. For segment reporting purposes, corporate reconciling items are not allocated to our various operating segments. R&D expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 9.3% in 2008 and 9.7% in 2007 and 2006. R&D expenses increased $51.5 and $135.3 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008, the increase was primarily due to higher personnel related costs and increased facilities costs which increased by $74.7 and $6.2, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase was an increase in capitalized software development costs of $16.6 which reduced R&D costs and a reduction in the cost of materials to support new product development of $14.4. In 2007, the increase was primarily due to higher personnel related costs and increased facilities cost which increased by $151.7 and $15.9, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase was an increase in capitalized software development costs of $27.6 which reduced R&D costs and a reduction in the costs of materials to support new product development of $20.3. R&D expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 18.2%, 19.3% and 16.5% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. R&D expenses increased $86.9 and $138.1 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to incremental headcount to support the growth of the business, resulting in increased salaries and benefits expense of $91.2 and $109.3 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases were software capitalization costs increases of $43.3 and $15.1 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, which reduced R&D costs. We expect the amount of software development costs which are capitalized to decrease in 2009 compared to 2008. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 30.9%, 29.6% and 29.2% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. SG&A expenses increased by $688.9 and $659.4 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, depreciation, travel costs and facilities costs to support the overall growth of the business and increased bad debt provisions. Personnel related costs increased by $468.2 and $420.5, depreciation increased by $49.4 and $59.5, travel increased by $6.1 and $57.1 and facilities costs increased by $28.3 and $28.9 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Bad debt provisions increased $25.8 in 2008 when compared to 2007 and decreased $1.4 in 2007 when compared to 2006. Corporate reconciling items within SG&A consist of stock based compensation and intangible asset amortization. These costs increased $91.5 to $367.2 in 2008 and increased $4.6 to $275.6 in 2007. In 2008, stock based compensation increased $56.8 and intangible asset amortization increased $34.7. The increase in stock based compensation consisted of a $31.3 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business and a $25.5 increase within EMCs Information Infrastructure business. The increase in stock based compensation expense was attributable to equity grants made in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, intangible asset amortization increased $27.4 and stock based compensation decreased $22.8. The increase in intangible asset amortization in 2008 and 2007 was attributable to amortization of intangible assets associated 27 Table of Contents with acquisitions by both EMCs Information Infrastructure business and the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business. The decrease in stock based compensation consisted of a $43.0 decrease within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, offset by a $20.2 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business. The decrease in stock based compensation expense within EMCs Information Infrastructure business was primarily attributable to higher valued options becoming fully vested in 2006. For segment reporting purposes, corporate reconciling items are not allocated to our various operating segments. SG&A expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 26.8%, 26.0% and 25.9% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. SG&A expenses increased by $393.1 and $389.8 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, depreciation and facilities costs to support the overall growth of the business. Personnel related costs increased by $265.5 and $262.7, depreciation increased by $34.9 and $51.8 and facilities increased by $20.8 and $5.5 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Bad debt provisions increased by $24.1 in 2008 when compared to 2007 and increased $1.8 in 2007 when compared to 2006. Travel costs decreased $2.9 in 2008 when compared to 2007 due to cost savings initiatives and increased $37.5 in 2007 when compared to 2006. SG&A expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 39.8%, 41.1% and 39.3% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. SG&A expenses increased $204.2 and $265.0 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2008 and 2007 was primarily the result of higher salaries and benefits due to increases in sales, marketing and administrative personnel costs of $153.5 and $180.5, respectively. The resources were added to support the growth of the business, including greater finance and legal personnel in response to being a public company, as well as higher commission expense resulting from increased sales volume. SG&A expenses also increased due to marketing expenses related to VMwares international market expansion and VMwares branding initiative. In Process Research and Development In process research and development ("IPR&D") was $85.8, $1.2 and $35.4 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, IPR&D projects relating to two of EMCs Information Infrastructure acquisitions and two VMware acquisitions were identified and written off at the time of the respective date of each acquisition because they had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility. The value assigned to the IPR&D was determined utilizing the income approach by determining cash flow projections relating to the identified IPR&D projects. The stage of completion of each in process project was estimated to determine the discount rates to be applied to the valuation of the in process technology. Based upon the level of completion and the risk associated with the in process technology, we applied discount rates ranging from 20% to 60% to value the IPR&D projects acquired. The increase in IPR&D in 2008 when compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to higher levels of in process R&D of acquisitions consummated during the respective period. The decrease in IPR&D in 2007 when compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to lower levels of in process R&D of acquisitions consummated during the respective period. Restructuring Charges and Impairment In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we incurred restructuring charges of $250.3, $31.3 and $162.6, respectively. To further improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global business in response to a challenging global economy, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we implemented a restructuring program to further streamline the costs related to our Information Infrastructure business. The plan includes the following components: A reduction in force resulting in the elimination of approximately 2,400 positions which will be substantially completed by the end of 2009 and fully completed by the third quarter of 2010. The consolidation of facilities and the termination of contracts. These actions are expected to be completed by 2015. The write off of certain assets for which EMC has determined it will no longer derive any benefit. These actions were completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition to this plan, we also recognized an asset impairment charge for certain assets for which the forecasted cash flows from the assets are less than the assets net book value. 28 Table of Contents The total charge resulting from these actions is expected to be between $362.0 and $387.0, with $247.9 recognized in 2008, $100.0 to $125.0 to be recognized in 2009 and 2010 and the remainder to be recognized through 2015. Total cash expenditures associated with the plan are expected to be in the range of $310.7 to $335.7. The 2008 charge consisted of the aforementioned fourth quarter restructuring program which aggregated $247.9, a third quarter charge of $8.6 and a net reduction of $6.2 relating to restructuring programs from prior years. For purposes of presentation, $244.7 of the 2008 charge is presented as a restructuring charge, $1.3 is presented as a reduction of SG&A and $6.9, related to the impairment of strategic investments, is presented within other expense, net on the consolidated income statement. The fourth quarter 2008 charge consisted of $195.5 for employee termination benefits associated with a reduction in workforce, a $28.0 charge for impaired long lived assets, a $21.8 charge associated with abandoned assets for which we will no longer derive a benefit and a $2.6 charge for contract terminations. These actions impacted substantially all of our functional organizations within our Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security segments and affected employees in each of our major geographical areas. As of December 31, 2008, we had eliminated approximately 500 of the 2,400 positions. The asset impairment charge of $28.0 consists of $21.1 of capitalized technology costs for which the forecasted cash flows from the assets are less than the assets net book value. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded its fair value, measured as the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows. The impairment charge also included a $6.9 charge for strategic investments for which the decline in their fair market value below their book value was considered other than temporary. The third quarter 2008 charge consisted of $5.5 for employee termination benefits associated with a reduction in force of approximately 75 employees and $3.1 for the consolidation of excess facilities and other items within our Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security segments. As of December 31, 2008, all of these actions had been completed. The 2007 charge consisted primarily of a $21.5 charge to increase the severance expenses associated with the 2006 restructuring program and a $13.3 charge for employee termination benefits associated with a 2007 rebalancing program impacting approximately 450 positions. As of December 31, 2008, all of these actions had been completed. These actions impacted our Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security segments and affected employees in each of our major geographical areas. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $3.2 associated with restructuring programs prior to 2006. The 2006 charge consisted of a $129.4 charge for employee termination benefits associated with a reduction in workforce, a $29.7 charge associated with abandoned assets for which we will no longer derive a benefit, a $10.9 charge for contract terminations and a $5.7 charge associated with vacating excess facilities. Partially offsetting these amounts were net adjustments of $13.1 associated with prior years restructuring programs. The 2006 charge for employee termination benefits covered approximately 1,350 employees worldwide. The workforce reductions objective was to further integrate EMC and the majority of the businesses we have acquired over the prior three years. These actions impacted substantially all of our functional organizations and affected employees in each of our major geographical areas. As of December 31, 2008, substantially all of these actions had been completed. The asset impairment charge of $29.7 consisted primarily of internal infrastructure projects that management decided to no longer pursue. The impairment charge was equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded its fair value, measured as the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows. The 2006 charges impacted the Information Storage and Content Management and Archiving segments. The activity for each charge is explained in the following sections. 29 Table of Contents 2008 Restructuring Programs The activity for the 2008 restructuring programs is presented below: 2008 Category Initial Provision Utilization During 2008 Ending Balance Non Cash Portion of the Provision Workforce reductions $ 201.0 $ (14.7 ) $ 186.3 $ 1.3 Abandoned and impaired assets 49.8 (49.8 ) 49.8 Consolidation of excess facilities and other contractual obligations 5.7 (3.4 ) 2.4 Total $ 256.5 $ (67.9 ) $ 188.7 $ 51.1 The remaining cash portion owed for these programs is $186.5.

The remaining cash portion owed for the 2007 and 2006 restructuring programs is $10.8. The cash expenditures relating to workforce reductions are expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2009. The cash expenditures relating to consolidation of excess facilities are expected to be paid out through 2018. Prior Year Restructuring Programs Prior to 2006, we had instituted several restructuring programs. The activity for these programs for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is presented below: 2008 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 1.3 $ (2.1 ) $ 2.7 $ 1.8 Consolidation of excess facilities 25.7 2.6 (9.7 ) 18.6 Other contractual obligations 0.8 0.9 Total $ 27.8 $ 0.5 $ (7.1 ) $ 21.2 2007 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 19.2 $ $ (17.9 ) $ 1.3 Consolidation of excess facilities 40.2 (3.3 ) (11.2 ) 25.7 Other contractual obligations 1.9 0.2 (1.2 ) 0.8 Total $ 61.4 $ (3.2 ) $ (30.4 ) $ 27.8 2006 Category Beginning Balance Adjustments to the Provision Utilization Ending Balance Workforce reduction $ 86.8 $ (5.0 ) $ (62.6 ) $ 19.2 Consolidation of excess facilities 65.4 (8.4 ) (16.8 ) 40.2 Other contractual obligations 2.4 0.3 (0.7 ) 1.9 Total $ 154.6 $ (13.1 ) $ (80.2 ) $ 61.4 The reductions to the provisions in 2007 and 2006 for excess facilities were a result of lower than expected costs associated with vacating leased facilities. These restructuring programs impacted the Information Storage and Content Management and Archiving segments. The remaining liability for the consolidation of excess facilities is expected to be paid through 2015. 31  Table of Contents Gain on Sale of VMware Stock to Cisco The gain on sale of VMware stock for the year ended December 31, 2007 consists of a $148.6 gain on the sale of 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock of VMware held by EMC sold to Cisco Systems, Inc. for proceeds of approximately $150.0. Investment Income Investment income was $247.0, $249.3 and $224.9 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Investment income decreased $2.3 in 2008 compared to 2007, due to a decrease in the weighted average return on investments, partially offset by higher average outstanding cash and investment balances and improved returns on sales of investments. Investment income increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher average outstanding cash and investment balances and lower realized losses on investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains and losses, was 3.1%, 4.3% and 4.2% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net realized gain (losses) were $6.6, $(10.1) and $(27.8) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect investment income to decline in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower weighted average returns, excluding realized gains and losses. Interest Expense In September 2006, we borrowed $2,200.0 under a six month unsecured credit facility to finance the acquisition of RSA. In November 2006, we completed the issuance of our $1,725.0 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes") and our $1,725.0 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes" and, together with the 2011 Notes, the "Notes"). A portion of the proceeds from the Notes was used to repay in full the $2,200.0 of outstanding indebtedness under the aforementioned unsecured credit facility. Interest expense was $73.8, $72.9 and $34.1 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on the Notes. Effective in 2009, we adopted FASB Staff Position No. APB 14 1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)". The statement requires that we revise our prior period financial statements. As a result of this revision, the Notes will be recorded at a discount to their face amount which will be accreted to their face amount over the term of the Notes resulting in additional interest expense. The incremental interest expense will represent a non cash charge. This will result in recognizing incremental non cash interest expense of $11.5, $96.9 and $102.6 in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The incremental non cash interest charge in 2009 will be $108.3. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $39.4, $4.7 and $8.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses. The decrease in 2007 was primarily attributable to reductions in foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 18.4%, 18.4% and 11.7% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the United States. In 2008, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 15.0 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 2.7 percentage points. The net effect of non deductible permanent differences, state taxes, tax credits and other items was an increase to the rate of 1.1 percentage points. In 2007, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 14.5 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. We had a reduction in our valuation allowance which principally arose from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards towards the capital gain on the sale of VMware stock to Cisco resulting in a benefit to our effective tax rate of 1.5 percentage points. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination 32 Table of Contents of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 1.2 percentage points. The net effect of non deductible permanent differences, state taxes, tax credits and other items was an increase to the rate of 0.6 percentage points. In 2006, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 13.9 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 12.4 percentage points. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances collectively had a negative impact on the rate of 3.0 percentage points, driven principally by non deductible permanent differences. The effect of non deductible permanent differences increased the tax rate by 4.6% in 2008 compared to 1.7% in 2007. The increase was principally due to increased non deductible IPR&D and taxable earnings from foreign subsidiaries in 2008. Tax credits in 2008 reduced the effective tax rate by 4.9% compared to a 2.0% reduction in 2007. The increase was attributable to higher foreign tax credits relating to distributions from foreign subsidiaries in 2008 and higher U.S. R&D credits. Minority Interest in VMware The minority interest in VMware was $44.7 and $15.5 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The minority interest increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in VMwares net income and an increase in the weighted average minority interest percentage in 2008 compared to 2007. VMwares net income was $290.1 and $218.1 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, representing an increase of 33.0%. The weighted average minority interest was approximately 15% and 7% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash Flows and Financial Condition Cash provided by operating activities was $3,565.1, $3,126.6 and $2,140.4 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash received from customers was $15,378.1, $13,333.5 and $11,167.2 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash received from customers was primarily attributable to higher sales volume. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $11,747.0, $10,182.6 and $8,666.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase was partially attributable to higher headcount. Total headcount was approximately 42,100, 37,700 and 31,100 at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The headcount increase was due to the growth of the business, as well as continued acquisition activity. Cash received from dividends and interest was $240.0, $254.1 and $258.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid $232.3, $202.3 and $592.1, respectively, in income taxes. These payments are comprised of estimated taxes for the current year, extension payments for the prior year and refunds or payments associated with income tax filings and tax audits. Despite higher pre tax income, cash paid for income taxes decreased from 2006 to 2007, principally due to increased deductions for stock based compensation, increased federal R&D credits arising from a change in law and increased utilization of acquired net operating losses. Cash used in investing activities was $1,614.9, $1,162.9 and $2,296.7 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $725.5, $692.0 and $2,618.4 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capital additions were $695.9, $699.0 and $718.1 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalized software development costs were $295.0, $232.0 and $192.9 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in capitalized software development costs was attributable to a greater level of development costs being capitalized for VMware development activities. Net sales and maturities of investments were $75.1, $322.3 and $1,253.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This activity varies from period to period based upon our cash collections, cash requirements and maturity dates of our investments. During 2007, we received $150.0 in net proceeds from the sale of 6.0 million shares of our interest in VMware to Cisco. Cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(534.0), $679.5 and $(392.0) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, 2007 and 2006 we spent $1,489.5, $1,453.7 and $3,655.4 to repurchase 112.2 million, 89.4 million and 302.3 million shares of our common stock, respectively. We generated $431.2, $785.2 and $257.8 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, from the exercise of stock options. Stock options exercises from VMwares stock option grants contributed $190.1 to the $431.2 generated in cash from the exercise of options in 2008. Additionally, the exercising of stock options generated excess tax benefits of $97.7 in 2008, $91.8 in 2007 and $20.0 in 2006. In 2008, we received $412.3 in proceeds from our securities lending program. The program enables us to receive an incremental return on our investment. We spent $13.3 to purchase 500,000 shares of VMware common stock previously sold to Intel Capital Corporation. During 2007, we received proceeds 33 Table of Contents from the sale of VMwares Class A common stock in its IPO and to Intel of $1,253.5. Proceeds from short and long term obligations were $33.7, $19.8 and $5,654.0 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In September 2006, we borrowed $2,200.0 under a six month unsecured credit facility to finance the acquisition of RSA. In November 2006, we also closed the sale of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes for an aggregate amount of $3,450.0. We utilized $2,200.0 of the Note proceeds to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under our six month unsecured credit facility which was used to finance the acquisition of RSA. In 2006, we also paid $126.1 to redeem the outstanding principal balance of the Documentum Notes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate amount of liabilities of our subsidiaries was approximately $3,900.0, excluding intercompany liabilities. Holders may convert their Notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding (i) September 1, 2011, with respect to the 2011 Notes, and (ii) September 1, 2013, with respect to the 2013 Notes, in each case only under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the price per Note of the applicable series for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day or at least $20.90 per share; (2) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter or (3) upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Notes. Additionally, the Notes will become convertible during the last three months prior to the respective maturities of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the Notes converted. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes converted, we have the option to settle the excess with cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value, determined in accordance with the indenture, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 day observation period. The initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 62.1978 shares of our common stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which represents a 27.5 percent conversion premium from the date the Notes were issued and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.08 per share of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events as set forth in the indenture. In addition, if a "fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of Notes that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such fundamental change. Subject to certain exceptions, if we undergo a "designated event" (as defined in the indenture) including a "fundamental change," holders of the Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes. The designated event repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus any accrued interest up to but excluding the relevant repurchase date. There has not been a designated event requiring us to repurchase the Notes. We will pay cash for all Notes so repurchased. We may not redeem the Notes prior to maturity. The Notes pay interest in cash at a rate of 1.75% semi annually in arrears on December 1 and June 1 of each year. Aggregate debt issuance costs of approximately $58.9 are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. In connection with the sale of the Notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock (the "Purchased Options"). The Purchased Options allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to holders of the Notes upon conversion. The Purchased Options will cover, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of our common stock. Half of the Purchased Options expire on December 1, 2011 and the remaining half of the Purchased Options expire on December 1, 2013. We paid an aggregate amount of $669.1 of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the Purchased Options. We also entered into separate transactions in which we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of our common stock (the "Sold Warrants") at an exercise price of approximately $19.55 per share of our common stock. Half of the Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 15, 2012 and March 15, 2012 and the remaining half of the Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 18, 2014 and March 18, 2014. We received aggregate proceeds of $391.1 from the sale of the Sold Warrants. 34 Table of Contents The Purchased Options and Sold Warrants will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately $19.55 per share of our common stock, representing an approximate 55 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per share of our common stock on November 13, 2006. The cost of the Purchased Options and net proceeds from the sale of the Sold Warrants were recorded in stockholders equity. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,057.5, $917.3 and $764.2 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in each year was primarily attributable to intangible asset amortization expense which increased by $76.1 and $51.8 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, associated with increased acquisition activity. Higher amortization expense associated with an increase in capitalized software development costs contributed $33.3 and $26.4 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, to the increase. A general growth in our property, plant and equipment balances in each year also resulted in greater depreciation expense of $30.8 and $74.9 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We have a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. As of December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the banks base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance, if any. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the covenants. At December 31, 2008, our total cash, cash equivalents, and short term and long term investments were $9,177.5. This balance includes approximately $1,840.8 held by VMware and $3,587.5 held by EMC in overseas entities. Our investments are comprised primarily of debt securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair market values. At December 31, 2008, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. At December 31, 2007, our available for sale, short and long term investments were recognized at fair value which was determined based upon quoted market prices. At December 31, 2008, auction rate securities were valued using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include an incremental discount rate for the lack of liquidity in the market ("liquidity discount margin") for an estimated period of time. The discount rate we selected was based on AA rated banks as the majority of our portfolio is invested in student loans where EMC acts as a financier to these lenders. The liquidity discount margin represents an estimate of the additional return an investor would require for the lack of liquidity of these securities over an estimated two year holding period. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we increased the liquidity discount margin from 3.0% to 5.0% as a result of declining market conditions. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our total cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments along with the respective unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2008: December 31, 2008 Amortized Cost Basis Aggregate Fair Value Net Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Total cash and cash equivalents $ 5,843.7 $ 5,843.7 Investments: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,102.7 $ 1,130.5 $ 27.8 U.S. corporate debt securities 463.9 451.8 (12.1 ) Asset and mortgage backed securities 304.8 263.4 (41.4 ) Municipal obligations 1,230.8 1,243.3 12.5 Auction rate securities 230.2 199.2 (31.0 ) Foreign debt securities 45.9 45.6 (0.3 ) Total investments 3,378.3 3,333.8 (44.5 ) Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 9,222.0 $ 9,177.5 $ (44.5 ) Investment Losses As of December 31, 2008, the gross unrealized losses on our investment portfolio were $89.6. The gross unrealized gains were $45.1. Our unrealized losses were primarily caused by a major disruption to the global capital markets, including a deterioration of confidence and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt securities. The result has been to depress securities values in most types of investments. We considered $2.6 of unrealized losses to be other than temporary and recognized the losses as a charge to earnings. We considered $89.6 of losses to be temporary and recognized the estimated decline in value as a component of other comprehensive loss within our stockholders equity. In making this determination, we considered the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the underlying value and performance of the collateral, the time to maturity, the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity if necessary to avoid losses. The significant components of the temporary impairments are as follows: Auction Rate Securities Our auction rate securities are predominantly rated AAA and are primarily collateralized by student loans. The underlying loans of all but two of our auction rate securities, with a market value of $17.5, have partial guarantees by the U.S. government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP") through the U.S. Department of Education. FFELP guarantees at least 95% of the loans which collateralize the auction rate securities. The two securities whose underlying loans are not guaranteed by the U.S. government have credit enhancements and are insured by third party agencies. We believe the quality of the collateral underlying all of our auction rate securities will enable us to recover our principal balance in full. As of December 31, 2007, we held $972.5 of auction rate securities at par value, which was equal to fair value as of that date. During the first quarter of 2008, we sold $684.0 of these auction rate securities at par through the normal auction process. Beginning in mid February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the complete failure of auctions associated with our auction rate securities as the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of bids. For each unsuccessful auction, the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each security, generally reset periodically at a level higher than defined short term interest benchmarks. To date, we have collected all interest payable on all of our auction rate securities when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. The principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, issuers repay principal over time from cash flows prior to final maturity, or final payments come due according to contractual maturities ranging from 15 to 40 years. We understand that issuers and financial markets are in the process of developing alternatives that may improve liquidity, although it is not yet clear when or to what extent such efforts will be successful. We expect that we will receive the entire principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above. None of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed or collateralized debt obligations. 36  Table of Contents Asset and Mortgage Backed Securities Our asset and mortgage backed securities are predominantly rated AAA. The assets underlying these securities are generally residential or commercial obligations, automobile loans, credit card loans, equipment loans and home equity loans. The average maturity is 0.67 years and 2.06 years for the asset backed and mortgage backed securities, respectively. For these securities, 50% are mortgage backed. The mortgage loans may have fixed rate or adjustable rate terms. The remainder of the portfolio consists of asset backed securities. To date we have collected all interest payable on all these securities when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. For each security which has a temporary decline in value, we analyzed the collateral value, collateral statistics, including the borrowers payment history, and our position in the capital structure. We estimated the losses in the underlying loans for these securities and compared these losses to our position in the security. For those securities where the underlying collateral is not sufficient, we have recorded other than temporary losses on these securities which aggregated $2.6. For the securities where the collateral is deemed to be adequate, we believe we will realize the current cost basis of these securities based on our position in the credit structure. U.S. Corporate Debt Securities Our U.S. corporate debt securities are predominantly rated A or better. The security issuers are from a cross section of industries, including banking and finance, insurance, consumer, industrial, technology and utilities. To mitigate concentration of risk, we impose sector limits at the portfolio and CUSIP level. The average maturity is 1.14 years. To date, we have collected all interest payable on all the debt securities when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We have analyzed the issuers credit history, current financial standing and their ability to retire the debt obligations. We expect that we will receive the entire principal associated with these securities. At December 31, 2008, we held $5,843.7 of cash and cash equivalents with a maturity of 90 days or less. Due to the nature of these assets, we consider it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates. We believe our current cash and investment position should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements in 2009. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years* 3 5 years** More than 5 years Operating leases $ 894.4 $ 171.1 $ 304.1 $ 56.2 $ 363.0 Long term convertible debt 3,450.0 1,725.0 1,725.0 Other long term obligations, including notes payable, current portion of long term obligations and post retirement obligations 180.9 70.9 2.5 1.2 2.6 Purchase orders 1,425.3 1,385.2 40.1 Securities lending payable 412.3 412.3 Uncertain tax positions 218.5 Total $ 6,581.4 $ 2,039.5 $ 2,071.7 $ 1,782.4 $ 365.6 *Includes payments from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012. **Includes payments from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014. 37 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, we had $218.5 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions under FASB Interpretation 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes." We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations. Included in other long term obligations are post retirement obligations of $103.7. We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space in most cases is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The long term convertible debt pertains to the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $67.7 as of December 31, 2008. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and or copyright. Most of these agreements in which we license our trademarks to another party require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time, we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. We have agreed to indemnify the directors, executive officers and certain other officers of EMC and our subsidiaries, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2008, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2008 are not material. 38 Table of Contents Notes and Accounts Receivable We derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems. We customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. If recourse is retained, we assess and provide for any estimated exposure. Litigation We are a party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have learned that the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "DoJ") is investigating allegations concerning (i) EMCs fee arrangements with systems integrators and other partners in federal government transactions, and (ii) EMCs compliance with the terms and conditions of certain agreements pursuant to which we sold products and services to the federal government, including potential violations of the False Claims Act. The subject matter of this investigation also overlaps with that of a previous audit by the U.S. General Services Administration ("GSA") concerning our recordkeeping and pricing practices under a schedule agreement we entered into with GSA in November 1999 which, following several extensions, expired in June 2007. We have cooperated with both the audit and the DoJ investigation, voluntarily providing documents and information, and have engaged in discussions aimed at resolving this matter without any admission or finding of liability on the part of EMC. We believe that we have meritorious factual and legal defenses to the allegations raised and, if the matter is not resolved and proceeds to litigation, we intend to defend vigorously. If the matter proceeds to litigation, possible sanctions include an award of damages, including treble damages, fines, penalties and other sanctions, including suspension or debarment from sales to the federal government. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, we have estimated the loss that may result from this matter, and such amount is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is not possible to predict the outcome of this matter with certainty, and the actual amount of loss may prove to be larger or smaller than the amount reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Pension and Post Retirement Medical and Life Insurance Plans We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans which were assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which cover substantially all former Data General employees located in the U.S. and Canada (the "Pension Plans"). The Pension Plans were frozen in 1999, resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for the Pension Plans are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 8.25%. This rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for the Pension Plans weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2008. For the ten years ended December 31, 2007, the actual long term rate of return was 6.0%. In 2008, we experienced a 27.0% loss on the plans assets. As a result, the actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2008 was 1.6%. Based upon current market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2009 will be decreased to 8.0%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a $0.7 impact on the 2008 pension expense. As of December 31, 2008, the Pension Plans had a $218.2 accumulated actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 6.6%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated AA or higher from a reputable rating agency. This rate represents the average of the discount rates for the Pension Plans weighted by plan liabilities as of December 31, 2008. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.5 impact on the 2008 pension expense for the Pension Plans. Additionally, certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans. These foreign pension plans are excluded from this discussion because they do not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the Data General acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former Data General employees. The plans assets are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The market related value of the plans assets is equal to the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on the plans assets for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 8.25%. For the ten years ended December 31, 2007, the actual long term rate of return was 6.0%. In 2008, we experienced a 27.0% loss on the plans assets. As a result, the 39 Table of Contents actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended December 31, 2008 was 1.6%. Based on capital market conditions, the expected long term rate of return for 2009 will be decreased to 8.0%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense. As of December 31, 2008, the plan had $0.3 accumulated actuarial loss that will be recognized over the anticipated remaining years of service for participants. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 6.6%. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated AA or higher from a reputable rating agency. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the areas set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles, including SAB No. 104, "Revenue Recognition"; Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"; Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition"; FAS No. 48, "Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists"; FAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases"; and SOP No. 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts," among others. The application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including estimates of fair value in arrangements with multiple deliverables, assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. We estimate systems warranty costs based upon historical experience, specific identification of system requirements and projected costs to service items under warranty. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. To the extent that our actual systems warranty costs differed from our estimates by 5 percent, consolidated pre tax income would have increased/decreased by approximately $11.5 and $11.6 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The market value of our short and long term investments is based primarily upon the listed price of the security. At December 31, 2008, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to 40 Table of Contents determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. In the event the fair market values that we determine are not accurate or we are unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner, we may not realize the recorded value of our investments. We hold investments whose market value is below our cost. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the underlying value and performance of the collateral, the time to maturity, length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and our levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, at least annually, in the fourth quarter of each year. Our assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which, for certain of our segments, is one step below our segment level. For each assessment, we compare the market value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimate fair value by employing different methodologies, including a comparison to comparable industry companies and several different discounted cash flow methodologies. The determination of relevant comparable industry companies impacts our assessment of fair value. Should the operating performance of our reporting units change in comparison to these companies or should the valuation of these companies change, this could impact our assessment of the fair value of the reporting units. Our discounted cash flow analyses factor in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates. These estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Additionally, these discounted cash flow analyses factor in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2008, 2007, 2006 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions, negotiations with third parties and finalization of severance agreements with employees. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. Accounting for Stock based Compensation For our share based payment awards, we make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options, including volatility, expected life and forfeiture rates. Additionally, for awards which are performance based, we make estimates as to the probability of the underlying performance being achieved. Changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the value and timing of stock based compensation expense recognized, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. 41  Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements We adopted Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS No. 157") on January 1, 2008. FAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. During 2008, the FASB issued the following amendments: FASB Staff Position No. 157 1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13" ("FSP FAS No. 157 1") amends FAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. The adoption of FSP FAS No. 157 1 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157" delays the effective date of FAS No. 157 from 2008 to 2009 for non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are currently evaluating the potential impact of FAS No. 157 for non financial assets and non financial liabilities on our financial position and results of operations. FASB Staff Position No. 157 3, "Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active" ("FSP FAS No. 157 3") clarifies the application of FAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP FAS No. 157 3 was effective October 2008, including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The adoption of FSP FAS No. 157 3 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("FAS No. 141R"). This statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The impact of the standard on our financial position and results of operations will be dependent upon the number of and magnitude of the acquisitions that are consummated once the standard is effective. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Board ("ARB") No. 51" ("FAS No. 160"). The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect FAS No. 160 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") on FAS No. 142 3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets" ("FSP FAS No. 142 3"). FSP FAS No. 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS No. 142"). The intent of FSP FAS No. 142 3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under FAS No. 141R and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. FSP FAS No. 142 3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect FSP FAS No. 142 3 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14 1, which changes the accounting treatment for certain convertible securities which include our Notes. Under FSP APB 14 1, issuers are required to allocate the bond proceeds into a bond portion and a conversion option. The allocation of the bond portion is based upon determining the value of a bond based upon the issuance costs of debt with no conversion option. The residual value is allocated to the conversion option. As a result of this change, the bonds are recorded at a discount which is accreted to its face value over the term of the debt using the effective interest method resulting in additional interest expense. The separated conversion option will be recorded in equity and not marked to market provided that the requirement for equity classification is met. FSP APB 14 1 requires issuers to 42 Table of Contents retroactively revise all periods presented. FSP APB 14 1 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2008, and early adoption is not permitted. We adopted FSP APB 14 1 on January 1, 2009. For financial statements for periods after January 1, 2009, we will revise prior period financial statements by reclassifying $669.1 of our Notes to additional paid in capital. Our interest expense will increase by $11.5 for 2006 (the year the Notes were issued), $96.9 for 2007 and $102.6 in 2008. Our diluted earnings per share will decrease by $0.0 for 2006 and $0.03 for each of 2007 and 2008. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to foreign exchange risk, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by Measurisk as of December 31, 2008. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2007. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2008 and 2007 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2008 $ 1.3 $ 1.7 $ 0.5 2007 $ 0.8 $ 1.0 $ 0.6 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or temporary loss recorded in other comprehensive loss. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. 43 Table of Contents We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the Measurisk dataset as of December 31, 2008. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $9.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2007. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2008 and 2007 were as follows (in millions): Average High Low 2008 $ 6.5 $ 9.4 $ 4.1 2007 $ 0.7 $ 2.4 $ (0.5 ) The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of bank deposits, money market investments, short and long term investments, accounts and notes receivable, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks in the United States may exceed the amount of FDIC insurance provided on such deposits. Deposits held with banks outside the United States generally do not benefit from FDIC insurance. The majority of our day to day banking operations globally are maintained with Citibank. We believe that Citibanks position as a primary clearing bank, coupled with the substantial monitoring of their daily liquidity, both by their internal processes and by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, mitigate some of our risk. Our money market investments are placed with money market funds that are 2A7 qualified. We limit our investments in money market funds to those that are primarily associated with large, money center financial institutions. While some money market funds were forced to break a one dollar net asset value as a result of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, none of the money market funds in which we were invested were affected. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the FDIC provided guarantees to investors in money market funds for balances held as of September 19, 2008. While most of our United States domiciled money market investments benefit from this guarantee, our offshore money market investments do not benefit from this guarantee. Our short and long term investments are invested primarily in investment grade securities, and we limit the amount of our investment in any single issuer. Some of our investments have been downgraded from investment grade as a result of the global financial crisis. We routinely monitor these investments and make assessments of our credit exposure as a result of these downgrades. We participate in securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. Securities are loaned to independent brokers for which we receive cash collateral equal to 102% of the fair market value of the securities. The loaned securities remain on our balance sheet as we maintain ownership while the investments are on loan. Our securities lending agent has provided us with a 100% counterparty indemnification in the event of borrower default. As of December 31, 2008, we had received $412.3 million in cash collateral which has been subsequently invested in short term investments. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivable is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $50.6 million and $35.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties on an ongoing basis. 44  Table of Contents
