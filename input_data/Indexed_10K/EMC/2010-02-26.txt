INTRODUCTION We manage our business in two broad categories: EMC Information Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure. EMC Information Infrastructure Our EMC Information Infrastructure business consists of three of our segments: Information Storage, Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security. Our objective for our EMC Information Infrastructure business is to grow faster than the markets we serve by investing in the business for sustainable advantage. Through a continued focus on enhancing and expanding our portfolio of systems, software, services and solutions to meet our customers needs, we believe we will be able to profitably increase revenues. We intend to enhance and expand our portfolio by accelerating our internal research and development (R&D) efforts and through acquisitions. Concurrent with these efforts, we will continue to focus on our cost structure. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we implemented a restructuring program to further streamline the costs related to our Information Infrastructure business. The programs focus is to consolidate back office functions, field and campus offices, rebalance investments towards higher growth products and markets, reduce management layers, and further reduce indirect spending on contractors, third party services and travel. Additionally, in 2009 we restructured the ownership of some of our subsidiaries to streamline our operations. In 2009, we reduced our costs in excess of $450 compared to our 2008 cost structure. These programs have favorably impacted our cost of sales, selling, general & administrative (SG&A) and R&D expenses. For 2009, approximately one third of these reductions related to our cost of sales and the remaining two thirds related to our other operating expenses. The programs savings are from both cost reductions and the transformation of several areas of our operational cost structure. As part of these efforts, we are undertaking several initiatives to transform the structural efficiency of our worldwide operations. These initiatives, which began in 2009, include the consolidation and movement of various facilities and processes. As part of these transformation efforts, we have incurred transition costs of $55 in 2009 and expect to incur an additional $50 in 2010. These investments are necessary to implement the new, more efficient capabilities ahead of transitioning from the existing cost structure. Through a combined focus on revenue growth, accelerated investment in R&D and continued cost containment efforts, we believe we will be able to increase 2010 earnings at a faster rate than the rate at which we will grow our revenues. Since mid 2008 and through most of 2009, we have observed that customers have responded to the economic downturn with reductions in their IT spending. As a result, we have experienced a decline in year over year product revenues. While the overall macroeconomic environment appears to be improving and customers appear to be moving cautiously with their IT spending, we remain conservative in planning and assume a slow economic recovery in which IT spending will continue to be tempered into 2010 and perhaps longer. VMware Virtual Infrastructure VMwares current financial focus is on long term revenue growth to generate cash flows to fund its expansion of industry segment share and development of virtualization based products for data centers, desktop computers and cloud computing through a combination of internal development and acquisitions. VMware expects to grow its business by broadening virtualization infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio, increasing product awareness, promoting the adoption of 23 Table of Contents virtualization, and building long term relationships with its customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements (ELAs). In the second quarter of 2009, VMware vSphere, the next generation of VMware infrastructure, became generally available. VMware View 4, which is integrated with VMware vSphere, became generally available in the fourth quarter of 2009. VMware View 4 represents a complete desktop virtualization solution that enables rapid adoption of virtualized desktops and establishes a desktop as a managed service model. VMware has introduced, and expects to continue to introduce, more products that build on the vSphere foundation through 2010 and beyond. Since mid 2008, and through most of 2009, VMware has observed that customers have responded to the economic downturn with reductions in their IT spending. As a result, customers were subjecting larger orders, such as ELAs, to a longer review process and in certain cases are purchasing products to meet their immediate needs, foregoing larger discounts offered under ELAs. While VMware experienced an increase in customer spending in the fourth quarter of 2009, which VMware believes is in response to previously suppressed demand and fiscal year end spending trends, VMware continues to plan conservatively for 2010. Although VMware is currently the leading provider of virtualization infrastructure software solutions, they face competitive threats to their leadership position from a number of companies, some of which have significantly greater resources than VMware, which could result in increased pressure to reduce prices on its offerings. As a result, VMware believes it is important to continue to invest in strategic initiatives related to product research and development, market expansion and associated support functions to expand its industry leadership. VMware believes that it will be able to continue to meet its product development objectives through continued investment in its business, supplemented with strategic hires and acquisitions, funded through the operating cash flows generated from the sale of existing products and services. VMware believes this is the appropriate priority for the long term health of its business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues The following table presents revenue by our segments: Percentage Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 Information Storage $ 10,659.4 $ 11,632.3 $ 10,610.9 (8.4 )% 9.6 % Content Management and Archiving 739.6 785.6 773.2 (5.9 ) 1.6 RSA Information Security 606.0 581.3 525.3 4.2 10.7 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 2,021.0 1,876.9 1,320.8 7.7 42.1 Total revenues $ 14,025.9 $ 14,876.2 $ 13,230.2 (5.7 )% 12.4 % Consolidated product revenues declined 12.3% to $8,828.1 in 2009 and increased 7.0% to $10,071.8 in 2008. The Information Storage segments product revenues declined 12.9% to $7,198.1 in 2009 and increased 5.8% to $8,263.5 in 2008. The Content Management and Archiving segments product revenues declined 6.3% and 17.6% to $260.8 and $278.2 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The RSA Information Security segments product revenues declined 4.2% and 0.8% to $340.3 and $355.1 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in product revenues in 2009 was primarily attributable to lower demand resulting from the challenging global economic environment and resulting negative impact in our customers IT purchases. Product revenues increased in the second half of 2009 as compared to the first half of the year as customers spent more of their budgets in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. The increase in Information Storage product revenues in 2008 was due to greater demand for these products attributable to increased demand for our IT infrastructure offerings and a broadened product portfolio. The decline in Content Management and Archiving and RSA Information Security product revenues in 2008 was primarily attributable to lower fourth quarter demand resulting from the challenging global economic environment and resulting negative impact in our customers IT purchases. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments product revenues declined 12.4% to $1,029.0 in 2009 and increased 30.1% to $1,175.1 in 2008. The decline in product revenues in 2009 was primarily attributable to lower demand resulting from the challenging global economic environment and resulting negative impact in VMwares customers IT purchases. The increase in VMware product revenues in 2008 was due to greater demand for these products attributable to increased demand for VMwares IT infrastructure offerings and a broadened product portfolio. 24 Table of Contents Consolidated services revenues increased 8.2% and 25.8% to $5,197.8 and $4,804.3 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Information Storage segments services revenues increased 2.7% and 20.4% to $3,461.4 and $3,368.8 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The RSA Information Security segments services revenue increased 17.5% and 35.2% to $265.7 and $226.2 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Services revenues increased for these segments in 2009 due to an increase in maintenance revenues resulting from continued demand for support from our installed base. The increased demand was partially offset by a decline in professional services revenue which was associated with the decline in product revenues. Services revenues increased in 2008 due to growing demand for both professional services and maintenance. The Content Management and Archiving segments services revenues declined 5.7% to $478.8 in 2009 and increased 16.5% to $507.5 in 2008. The decline in services revenues in 2009 was attributable to lower demand for our product offerings which reduced the demand for professional services. The increase in services revenues in 2008 was primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues resulting from continued demand for support from our installed base. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments services revenues increased 41.3% and 68.1% to $992.0 and $701.9 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, services revenues increased as a result of strong maintenance renewals, multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods, and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with software sales. In addition, the growth in services revenues benefited from customers becoming current on their maintenance agreements in order to receive VMwares new product offerings as part of those arrangements. As VMware focused on recovering back maintenance during 2009, the Company anticipates revenue from back maintenance to decline in 2010 as customers have become current. In 2008, the growth in services revenues reflected the increase in license revenues, as maintenance services are generally purchased with licenses, the benefit from multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods and renewals of existing customer software maintenance contracts. Consolidated revenues by geography were as follows: Percentage Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 United States $ 7,384.3 $ 7,990.8 $ 7,343.0 (7.6 )% 8.8 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,290.3 4,555.0 3,921.1 (5.8 ) 16.2 Asia Pacific 1,603.1 1,640.1 1,400.0 (2.3 ) 17.2 Latin America, Mexico and Canada 748.2 690.3 566.1 8.4 21.9 Revenues decreased in 2009 in all of our markets, with the exception of Latin America, Mexico and Canada, due to the challenging global economic environment and resulting negative impact in customers IT purchases. Revenues improved in Latin America, Mexico and Canada primarily due to increased demand for our offerings. Revenues increased in 2008 in all of our markets due to greater demand for our products and services offerings. Changes in exchange rates negatively impacted revenues by 1.4% in 2009 and positively impacted revenues by 0.8% in 2008. The impact of the change in rates in 2009 and 2008 was most significant in the European market, primarily Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. 25 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses The following table presents our costs and expenses, other income and net income attributable to EMC Corporation. Percentage Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 Cost of revenue: Information Storage $ 5,256.7 $ 5,670.1 $ 5,237.2 (7.3 )% 8.3 % Content Management and Archiving 274.8 305.6 271.5 (10.1 ) 12.6 RSA Information Security 186.5 170.6 144.4 9.3 18.1 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 316.3 268.7 188.6 17.7 42.5 Corporate reconciling items 246.8 238.7 177.2 3.4 34.7 Total cost of revenue 6,281.0 6,653.8 6,018.9 (5.6 ) 10.5 Gross margins: Information Storage 5,402.7 5,962.2 5,373.6 (9.4 ) 11.0 Content Management and Archiving 464.8 480.0 501.8 (3.2 ) (4.3 ) RSA Information Security 419.5 410.7 380.9 2.1 7.8 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 1,704.7 1,608.2 1,132.2 6.0 42.0 Corporate reconciling items (246.8 ) (238.7 ) (177.2 ) 3.4 34.7 Total gross margin 7,744.9 8,222.4 7,211.3 (5.8 ) 14.0 Operating expenses: Research and development(1) 1,627.5 1,721.3 1,526.9 (5.4 ) 12.7 Selling, general and administrative(2) 4,595.6 4,601.6 3,912.7 (0.1 ) 17.6 In process research and development 85.8 1.2 (100.0 ) 7,050.0 Restructuring and acquisition related charges 107.5 244.7 31.3 (56.1 ) 681.8 Total operating expenses 6,330.6 6,653.4 5,472.1 (4.9 ) 21.6 Operating income 1,414.3 1,568.9 1,739.3 (9.9 ) (9.8 ) Investment income, interest expense and other expenses(3) (39.7 ) 31.3 223.4 (226.8 ) (86.0 ) Income before income taxes 1,374.6 1,600.2 1,962.6 (14.1 ) (18.5 ) Income tax provision 252.8 280.4 348.2 (9.8 ) (19.5 ) Net income 1,121.8 1,319.8 1,614.4 (15.0 ) (18.2 ) Less: Net income attributable to the non controlling interest in VMware, Inc.

(2) Amount includes corporate reconciling items of $495.5, $367.2 and $275.6 for the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. (3) Amount includes gain of $148.6 on sale of VMware stock to Cisco in 2007. Gross Margins Our gross margin percentages were 55.2%, 55.3% and 54.5% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to the Information Storage segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 17 basis points and the RSA Information Security segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 5 basis points. These declines were partially offset by the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment which improved overall gross margins by 11 basis points, and the Content Management and Archiving segment which improved overall gross margins by 7 basis points. The increase in corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and transition costs, decreased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 6 basis points. The improvement in the gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 was attributable to the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment, which contributed 123 basis points, and the Information Storage segment, which contributed 21 basis points to the overall gross margin improvement. These improvements were partially offset by the margin impact of the Content Management and Archiving segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 19 basis points and the RSA Information Security segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 1 basis point. The increase in corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation and acquisition related intangible asset amortization, decreased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 44 basis points. 26 Table of Contents For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and transition costs are recognized as corporate expenses and are not allocated among our various operating segments. The increase of $8.1 in the corporate reconciling items in 2009 was attributable to a $12.5 increase in restructuring charges, a $19.3 increase in stock based compensation expense and $3.1 in transition costs, partially offset by a $26.8 decrease in acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense. The $12.5 increase in restructuring charges in 2009 was attributable to a loss recognized on a contractual obligation with a minimum purchase obligation that is not expected to be fulfilled. The $19.3 increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to incremental expense associated with options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain and expense associated with VMwares equity grants. The decrease in intangible asset amortization expense in 2009 was attributable to acquisition related intangible assets acquired in acquisitions becoming fully amortized. The transition costs represent the incremental costs incurred to transform our current cost structure to a more streamlined cost structure. The increase of $61.5 in the corporate reconciling items in 2008 was attributable to a $38.6 increase in intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions and a $22.9 increase in stock based compensation expense, primarily attributable to VMware equity grants. The gross margin percentages for the Information Storage segment were 50.7%, 51.3% and 50.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower sales volume and a greater mix of lower margin Iomega revenue. Iomega, acquired in June 2008, operates within the consumer and small business marketplace which historically has had lower gross margins than marketplaces typically served by our Information Storage segment. Partially offsetting these declines was an improvement in the gross margin attributable to a greater mix of higher margin services revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Services revenues as a percentage of total Information Storage segment revenues increased to 32.5% in 2009 from 29.0% in 2008. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to our ability to achieve higher gross margins from our focus on selling overall solutions to our customers, partially offset by the margin impact from the acquisition of Iomega. The gross margin percentages for the Content Management and Archiving segment were 62.8%, 61.1% and 64.9% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of services revenues with a higher proportion of maintenance revenues and a lower proportion of professional services revenues to total services revenues. Maintenance revenues generally provide a higher margin percentage than professional services revenues. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to a decline in product revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 43.6% in 2007 to 35.4% in 2008. Product revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than software maintenance and other services revenues. The gross margin percentages for the RSA Information Security segment were 69.2%, 70.6% and 72.5% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decreases in the gross margin percentage in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to a decrease in product revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 68.1% in 2007 to 61.1% in 2008 and to 56.2% in 2009. Product revenues generally provide a higher gross margin percentage than services revenues. The gross margin percentages for the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment were 84.4% in 2009, 85.7% in 2008 and 85.7% in 2007. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2009 was primarily attributable to an increase in the amortization of software development costs as a percentage of total segment revenues. The amortization of software development costs as a percentage of total segment revenues increased to 3.3% in 2009, compared to 2.3% in 2008. The consistency in the gross margin percentage in 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to consistent software license and maintenance revenue mix as a percentage of total revenues. Software license and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from 93.2% in 2007 to 92.2% in 2008. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 11.6%, 11.6% and 11.5% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. R&D expenses decreased $93.8 in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs, depreciation expense, materials costs and facilities costs. Personnel related costs decreased by $19.9, depreciation expense decreased by $19.1, the cost of materials to support new product development decreased by $14.0 and the cost of facilities decreased by $11.9. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $9.5. R&D expenses increased $194.4 in 2008 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs and facilities costs. Personnel related costs increased by $218.5 and the cost of facilities increased by $26.4. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the cost of materials to support new product development of $13.2. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $59.9. 27 Table of Contents Corporate reconciling items within R&D, which consist of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and transition costs increased $60.4 and $56.0 to $235.8 and $175.4 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Stock based compensation expense increased $52.2 and $54.4 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Acquisition related intangible asset amortization decreased $0.2 in 2009 and increased $1.6 in 2008 and transition costs were $8.4 and $0.0 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2009 was primarily attributable to incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and expense associated with options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2008 was primarily attributable to incremental VMware equity grants made in 2007 and 2008. For segment reporting purposes, corporate reconciling items are not allocated to our various operating segments. R&D expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 8.5%, 9.3% and 9.7% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. R&D expenses decreased $181.6 in 2009 primarily due to a reduction in personnel related costs, facilities costs, materials costs and depreciation expense. Personnel related costs decreased by $99.0, the cost of facilities decreased by $18.2, the cost of materials to support new product development decreased by $14.0 and depreciation expense decreased by $13.4. In 2009, the cost reductions were primarily due to savings achieved as a result of our 2008 restructuring programs, our cost savings initiatives and greater levels of capitalized software development. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $31.8. The increase in capitalized software development costs is attributable to efforts associated with new product development. R&D expenses increased $51.5 in 2008 primarily due to higher personnel related costs and increased facilities costs which increased by $74.7 and $6.2, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the cost of materials to support new product development of $14.4 and a $16.6 increase in capitalized software development costs, which reduces R&D expense. R&D expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 18.3%, 18.2% and 19.3% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. R&D expenses increased $27.3 in 2009 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs, including salaries and benefits which increased $18.4 due to incremental headcount from strategic hiring and a decrease in capitalized software development costs, partially offset by decreased costs resulting from the austerity measure implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, decreased by $22.3 in 2009 when compared to 2008 as VMware vSphere became generally available in 2009. R&D expenses increased $86.9 in 2008 primarily due to incremental headcount to support the growth of the business, resulting in increased salaries and benefits expense of $91.2. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in software capitalization costs of $43.3 which reduced R&D costs. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 32.8%, 30.9% and 29.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. SG&A expenses decreased by $6.0 in 2009 driven by the cost reduction efforts implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. Personnel related costs, travel, supplies and other administrative costs declined by $103.3. Additionally, our provisions for bad debts decreased by $20.3. Partially offsetting these decreased costs were $57.5 for a provision for litigation, increased commissions of $53.3 and increased depreciation of $26.6. SG&A expenses increased by $688.9 in 2008 primarily due to higher personnel related costs, depreciation, facilities costs, bad debt provisions and travel costs. Personnel related costs increased by $468.2, depreciation increased by $49.4, facilities costs increased $28.3, bad debt provisions increased $25.8 and travel costs increased by $6.1. Corporate reconciling items within SG&A, which consist of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, provision for litigation and transition costs increased $128.3 and $91.5 to $495.5 and $367.2 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, we incurred $57.5 for a provision for litigation, stock based compensation expense increased $32.8 and transition costs increased $43.1. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense of $5.1. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2009 was primarily attributable to incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and expense associated with options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. In 2008, stock based compensation increased $56.8 and acquisition related intangible asset amortization increased $34.7. The increase in stock based compensation expense consisted of a $31.3 increase within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business and a $25.5 increase within EMCs Information Infrastructure business. The increase in stock based compensation expense was attributable to equity grants made in 2007 and 2008. The increase in acquisition related intangible amortization expense was attributable to amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions by both EMCs Information Infrastructure business and the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business. For segment reporting purposes, corporate reconciling items are not allocated to our various operating segments. SG&A expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 27.1%, 26.8% and 26.0% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. SG&A expenses decreased by $228.8 in 28 Table of Contents 2009 driven by the cost reduction efforts implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. Personnel related costs, travel, supplies and other administrative costs declined by $228.0. Additionally, our provisions for bad debts decreased by $21.2. Partially offsetting these decreased costs was an increase in depreciation expense of $15.8. In 2008, SG&A expenses increased by $393.1 primarily due to higher personnel related costs, depreciation and other SG&A costs. Personnel related costs increased by $265.5, depreciation expense increased by $34.9 and other SG&A costs increased by $42.0. SG&A expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 41.7%, 39.8% and 41.1% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. SG&A expenses increased $94.5 and $204.2 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses consisted primarily of higher commissions, increased salaries and benefits resulting from increased sales volume and incremental headcount added in conjunction with VMwares international expansion, as well as increased spending to enhance the sales and marketing systems infrastructure of its business. These cost increases were partially offset by decreased travel and entertainment costs resulting from the austerity measure implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008 and decreased marketing program expenses as compared with VMwares branding initiative in 2008. These austerity measures included, but were not limited to, reduced travel and entertainment costs, decreased contractor costs and hiring limited to roles that fit VMware strategic initiatives. In 2008, SG&A expenses increased by $204.2 primarily due to higher salaries and benefits due to increases in sales, marketing and administrative personnel costs of $153.5. The resources were added to support the growth of the business, including a greater number of finance and legal personnel needed to comply with public company requirements, as well as higher commission expense resulting from increased sales volume. SG&A expenses also increased due to marketing expenses related to VMwares international market expansion and VMwares branding initiative. In Process Research and Development We incurred no in process research and development (IPR&D) charges to the Consolidated Income Statement in 2009. As a result of accounting rule changes which were effective at the beginning of 2009, IPR&D resulting from business combinations is now capitalized as an asset with amortization commencing upon completion of the project. In connection with acquisitions in 2009, we acquired and capitalized $175.0 of IPR&D. IPR&D expense was $85.8 and $1.2 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, IPR&D projects relating to two EMC Information Infrastructure acquisitions and two VMware acquisitions were identified and written off at the time of the respective date of each acquisition because they had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility. The value assigned to the IPR&D was determined utilizing the income approach by determining cash flow projections relating to the identified IPR&D projects. The stage of completion of each in process project was estimated to determine the discount rates to be applied to the valuation of the in process technology. Based upon the level of completion and the risk associated with the in process technology, we applied discount rates ranging from 20% to 60% to value the IPR&D projects acquired. The increase in IPR&D in 2008 when compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to higher levels of in process R&D of acquisitions consummated during the respective period. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Charges In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred restructuring and acquisition related charges of $107.5, $250.3 and $31.3, respectively. In 2009, we incurred $88.4 of restructuring charges, primarily related to our 2008 restructuring program and $19.1 of costs in connection with acquisitions for financial advisory, legal and accounting services. In 2008 and 2007, all charges are only related to restructuring activities. In the fourth quarter of 2008, to further improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global business in response to a challenging global economy, we implemented a restructuring program to further streamline the costs related to our Information Infrastructure business. The plan included the following components: A reduction in force resulting in the elimination of approximately 2,400 positions which was substantially completed by the end of 2009 and will be fully completed in 2010. The consolidation of facilities and the termination of contracts. These actions are expected to be completed by 2015. The write off of certain assets for which EMC has determined it will no longer derive any benefit. These actions were completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition to this plan, we also recognized in 2008 an asset impairment charge of $28.0 for certain assets for which the forecasted cash flows from the assets are less than the assets net book value. 29 Table of Contents The total charge resulting from these actions is expected to be approximately $400.0, with $247.9 recognized in 2008, $87.0 recognized in 2009, $35.0 expected to be recognized in 2010 and the remainder expected to be recognized in 2011 through 2015. The remaining cash portion owed for these programs is approximately $69.0 which will be paid over periods through 2015. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investment Income Investment income was $140.4, $247.0 and $249.3 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Investment income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower weighted average returns on investments. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized losses and gains, was 1.3%, 3.1% and 4.3% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net realized gain (losses) were $20.8, $6.6 and $(10.1) in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense was $182.5, $176.4 and $169.8 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our long term convertible debt. Included in interest expense are non cash interest charges of $108.3, $102.6 and $96.9 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We are accreting our long term convertible debt to their face values over their term. See Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $2.4, $(39.4) and $(4.7) in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in 2009 was primarily attributable to gains on common stock investments in Data Domain and SpringSource. As part of the acquisition of these entities, our previously held investments were re measured to fair value, resulting in $25.8 of gains. Absent these gains, other income (expense) is primarily foreign currency translation losses. Foreign currency transaction losses were lower in 2009 when compared to 2008. The increase in 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 18.4%, 17.5% and 17.7% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is substantially lower than our income tax rate in the United States. In 2009, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 17.5 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 4.5 percentage points. In 2009, we effected a plan to reorganize our international operations by transferring certain assets of our RSA and Data Domain entities and legacy foreign corporations owned directly by EMC into a single EMC international holding company. As a result of this reorganization, we incurred income taxes which negatively impacted the rate by 4.4 percentage points. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances and other items collectively increased the rate by 1.0 percentage point, driven principally by non deductible permanent differences. In 2008, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 15.9 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 2.9 percentage points. The net effect of non deductible permanent differences, state taxes, tax credits and other items was an increase to the rate of 1.3 percentage points. In 2007, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 15.2 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. We had a reduction in our valuation allowance which principally arose from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards towards the capital gain on the sale of VMware stock to Cisco resulting in a benefit to our effective tax rate of 1.5 percentage points. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 1.3 percentage points. The net effect of non deductible permanent differences, state taxes, tax credits and other items was an increase to the rate of 0.7 percentage points. 30 Table of Contents The effective tax rate increased from 2008 to 2009 by 0.9%, from 17.5% to 18.4%. This increase was principally attributable to the reorganization of RSA and Data Domain in 2009, which was partially offset by incremental benefits from the resolution of uncertain tax positions inclusive of the expiration of statutes of limitation. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2008 were relatively constant. Non controlling Interest in VMware, Inc. The net income attributable to the non controlling interest in VMware was $33.7, $44.7 and $15.5 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. VMwares reported net income was $197.1, $290.1 and $218.1 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted average non controlling interest in VMware was approximately 17.0%, 15.0% and 7.0% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Financial Condition Cash provided by operating activities was $3,334.4, $3,565.1 and $3,126.6 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash received from customers was $14,647.7, $15,378.1 and $13,333.5 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, the decrease in cash received from customers was attributable to a reduction in sales volume. In 2008, the increase in cash received from customers was attributable to higher sales volume. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $11,032.9, $11,747.0 and $10,182.6 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, the decrease was attributable to a reduction in purchases associated with a reduction in sales volume and a decrease in compensation costs. In 2008, the increase was partially attributable to higher headcount due to the growth of the business, as well as continued acquisition activity. Total headcount was approximately 43,200, 42,100 and 37,700 at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash received from dividends and interest was $109.5, $240.0 and $254.1 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid $316.5, $232.3 and $202.3, respectively, in income taxes. These payments are comprised of estimated taxes for the current year, extension payments for the prior year and refunds or payments associated with income tax filings and tax audits. Cash used in investing activities was $3,095.5, $1,614.9 and $1,162.9 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions, strategic and other related investments were $2,847.1, $731.0 and $704.1 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, net of cash and investments acquired, we acquired Data Domain for $1,933.9 and VMware acquired SpringSource for $356.3. Capital additions were $411.6, $695.9 and $699.0 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The lower level of capital additions in 2009 was due to lower spending on infrastructure as part of our cost savings initiatives. Capitalized software development costs were $304.5, $295.0 and $232.0 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net sales of investments were $466.6, $75.1 and $322.3 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This activity varies from period to period based upon our cash collections, cash requirements and maturity dates of our investments. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $211.9, $(534.0) and $679.5 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2007, we spent $1,489.5 and $1,453.7 to repurchase 112.2 million and 89.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively. We made no share repurchases in 2009. We plan to spend approximately $1,000.0 on common stock repurchases during 2010; however, the number of shares purchased and timing of our purchases will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the price of our stock, market conditions, our cash position and alternative demands for our cash resources. We generated $594.0, $431.2 and $785.2 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, from the exercise of stock options. Stock options exercises from VMwares stock option grants contributed $227.7 and $190.1 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, we satisfied our commitment under our securities lending program by repaying $412.3. During 2007, we received proceeds from the sale of VMwares Class A common stock in its IPO and to Intel of $1,253.5. We have a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. As of December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. We have long term debt with a face value of $3,450, of which $1,725 is due 2011 and $1,725 is due 2013. The aggregate amount of liabilities of our subsidiaries is approximately $3,990.9. At December 31, 2009, our total cash, cash equivalents, and short term and long term investments were $9,387.7. This balance includes approximately $2,775.2 held by EMC in overseas entities and $2,486.5 held by VMware. 31 Table of Contents Investments The following table summarizes the composition of our investments at December 31, 2009: AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains Unrealized(Losses) AggregateFair Value U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,086.8 $ 8.0 $ (3.0 ) $ 1,091.8 U.S. corporate debt securities 866.4 13.1 (1.2 ) 878.2 Asset and mortgage backed securities 14.1 0.4 14.5 Municipal obligations 583.7 6.9 (0.1 ) 590.5 Auction rate securities 253.6 (19.2 ) 234.5 Foreign debt securities 274.3 1.9 (0.5 ) 275.7 Total $ 3,078.9 $ 30.3 $ (24.0 ) $ 3,085.2 Our investments are comprised primarily of debt securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair market values. At December 31, 2009, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. For all of our securities where the amortized cost basis was greater than the fair value at December 31, 2009, we have concluded that currently we neither plan to sell the security nor is it more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. In making the determination as to whether the unrealized loss is other than temporary, we considered the length of time and extent the investment has been in an unrealized loss position, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the issuers credit rating, the underlying value and performance of the collateral, third party guarantees and the time to maturity. Our auction rate securities are predominantly rated AAA and are primarily collateralized by student loans. The underlying loans of all but two of our auction rate securities, with a market value of $18.6, have partial guarantees by the U.S. government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) through the U.S. Department of Education. FFELP guarantees at least 95.0% of the loans which collateralize the auction rate securities. The two securities whose underlying loans are not guaranteed by the U.S. government have credit enhancements and are insured by third party agencies. We believe the quality of the collateral underlying all of our auction rate securities will enable us to recover our principal balance in full. To date, we have collected all interest payable on all of our auction rate securities when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. The principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, issuers repay principal over time from cash flows prior to final maturity, or final payments come due according to contractual maturities which range from 2024 to 2047. We expect that we will receive the entire principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above, and accordingly, we did not experience credit losses within our auction rate security portfolio. None of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed or collateralized debt obligations. See Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years* 3 5 years** More than5 years Operating leases $ 1,352.4 $ 273.8 $ 520.4 $ 107.2 $ 451.0 Long term convertible debt 3,450.0 1,725.0 1,725.0 Product warranty obligations 271.6 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations and post retirement obligations 184.9 94.5 2.3 1.2 1.7 Purchase orders 1,577.9 1,531.4 46.5 Uncertain tax positions 197.1 Total $ 7,033.9 $ 1,899.7 $ 2,294.2 $ 1,833.4 $ 452.7 *Includes payments from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. **Includes payments from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2009, we had $271.6 of product warranty obligations, $85.2 of long term post retirement obligations and $197.1 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space in most cases is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The long term convertible debt pertains to the $1.725 billion 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2011 and our $1.725 billion 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2013. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $70.0 as of December 31, 2009. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and or copyright. Certain agreements in which we grant limited licenses to specific EMC trademarks require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that the use of the licensed trademark infringes a third party trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time, we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. 33 Table of Contents We have agreed to indemnify the directors, executive officers and certain other officers of EMC and our subsidiaries, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2009, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2009 is not material. Litigation We are involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, and proceedings, including those identified below, that arise from time to time relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property, product liability, employment, benefits and securities matters. As required by authoritative guidance, we have estimated the amount of probable losses that may result from any such pending matters, and such amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We have disclosed the specific amount recorded for a particular matter where required by authoritative guidance. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, the actual amounts of loss may prove to be larger or smaller than the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect our operating results or cash flows in a particular period. United States ex rel. Rille and Roberts v. EMC Corporation. On February 27, 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas entered an order unsealing a civil False Claims Act qui tam action by two individuals (the relators) that named EMC as a defendant in December 2006. This action relates to the previously disclosed investigation conducted by the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the DoJ) regarding (i) EMCs fee arrangements with systems integrators and other partners in federal government transactions, and (ii) EMCs compliance with the terms and conditions of certain agreements pursuant to which we sold products and services to the federal government, primarily a schedule agreement we entered into with the United States General Services Administration in November 1999 which, following several extensions, expired in June 2007. The DoJ filed a complaint in intervention in this matter in June 2008. The DoJ and relators assert claims under the Anti Kickback Act and False Claims Act in addition to breach of contract and other claims, and seek various remedies, including treble damages and statutory penalties. By order dated June 3, 2009, the Arkansas Court granted a motion by EMC to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, where it is now pending. We continue to believe that we have meritorious factual and legal defenses to the allegations raised. EMC has been in ongoing settlement discussions with the DoJ to resolve the claims alleged in this matter. As a result of such discussions, we have recorded an $87.5 accrual for this contingency, which represents our assessment of the amount of probable loss that may result from this matter. Derivative Demand Letters. We have received derivative demand letters sent on behalf of purported EMC shareholders. The letters contain allegations to the effect that the existence of the matter captioned United States ex rel. Rille and Roberts v. EMC Corporation serves as evidence that certain Company officers and directors failed to exercise due care and or failed to oversee compliance with the laws identified in the Roberts matter. The matters relating to the demand letters were referred to a Special Committee of independent directors of the Board of Directors, which investigated and made a determination regarding such allegations. At the conclusion of their investigation, the Special Committee determined in good faith that commencing or maintaining derivative proceedings based on the allegations would not be in the best interests of EMC. In October 2009, one of the purported shareholders filed a complaint in the Superior Court for Middlesex County in Massachusetts alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty against EMC directors and certain officers based on the same allegations set forth in the demand letter. We are defending this matter vigorously. Pension We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the United States. Certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. All of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for these defined benefit plans are invested in common stocks and bonds. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The 34 Table of Contents expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 8.25%. This rate represents the average of the expected long term rates of return weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the ten year historical rate of return on plan assets was 2.8% and the inception to date return on plan assets was 9.7%. In 2009 and 2008, we experienced a 25.1% gain and 27.0% loss, respectively, on plan assets. Based upon current market conditions and the target allocation of the plans assets, the expected long term rate of return for 2010 is 8.25%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a $0.9 impact on the 2010 pension expense. As of December 31, 2009, the pension plan had a $183.8 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 6.0%. This rate represents the average of the discount rate weighted by the plans liabilities as of December 31, 2009. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated AA or higher from a reputable rating agency. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.8 impact on the 2010 pension expense for all plans. Additionally, certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans. These foreign pension plans are excluded from this discussion because they do not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the areas set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The application of the appropriate guidance within the Accounting Standards Codification to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems, software and services or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including estimates of fair value in arrangements with multiples deliverables, assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. We estimate systems warranty costs based upon historical experience, specific identification of system requirements and projected costs to service items under warranty. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. To the extent that our actual systems warranty costs differed from our estimates by 5 percent, consolidated pre tax income would have increased/decreased by approximately $13.6 and $13.5 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The market value of our short and long term investments is based primarily upon the listed price of the security. At December 31, 2009, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing 35 Table of Contents vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. In the event the fair market values that we determine are not accurate or we are unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner, we may not realize the recorded value of our investments. We hold investments whose market value is below our cost. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the underlying value and performance of the collateral, the time to maturity, length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and our levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, at least annually, in the fourth quarter of each year. Our assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which, for certain of our segments, is one step below our segment level. For each assessment, we compare the market value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimate fair value by employing different methodologies, including a comparison to comparable industry companies and several different discounted cash flow methodologies. The determination of relevant comparable industry companies impacts our assessment of fair value. Should the operating performance of our reporting units change in comparison to these companies or should the valuation of these companies change, this could impact our assessment of the fair value of the reporting units. Our discounted cash flow analyses factor in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates. These estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Additionally, these discounted cash flow analyses factor in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2009, 2008, 2007 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions, negotiations with third parties and finalization of severance agreements with employees. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. Accounting for Stock based Compensation For our share based payment awards, we make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options, including volatility, expected life and forfeiture rates. Additionally, for awards which are performance based, we make estimates as to the probability of the underlying performance being achieved. Changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the value and timing of stock based compensation expense recognized, which could have a material impact on our financial statements.

To manage the volatility relating to foreign exchange risk, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by Measurisk as of December 31, 2009. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was $0.6 as of December 31, 2009 and $1.4 as of December 31, 2008. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Average High Low 2009 $ 1.1 $ 2.0 $ 0.6 2008 $ 1.3 $ 1.7 $ 0.5 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or temporary loss recorded in other comprehensive loss. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the Measurisk dataset as of December 31, 2009. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $5.2 as of December 31, 2009 and $9.4 as of December 31, 2008. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Average High Low 2009 $ 4.5 $ 5.2 $ 3.9 2008 $ 6.5 $ 9.4 $ 4.1 37 Table of Contents The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of bank deposits, money market investments, short and long term investments, accounts and notes receivable, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks in the United States may exceed the amount of FDIC insurance provided on such deposits. Deposits held with banks outside the United States generally do not benefit from FDIC insurance. The majority of our day to day banking operations globally are maintained with Citibank. We believe that Citibanks position as a primary clearing bank, coupled with the substantial monitoring of their daily liquidity, both by their internal processes and by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, mitigate some of our risk. Our money market investments are placed with money market funds that are 2a 7 qualified. Rule 2a 7, adopted by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, establishes strict standards for quality, diversity and maturity, the objective of which is to maintain a constant net asset value of a dollar. We limit our investments in money market funds to those that are primarily associated with large, money center financial institutions. While some money market funds were forced to break a one dollar net asset value as a result of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, none of the money market funds in which we were invested were affected. Our short and long term investments are invested primarily in investment grade securities, and we limit the amount of our investment in any single issuer. Some of our investments have been downgraded from investment grade as a result of the global financial crisis. We routinely monitor these investments and make assessments of our credit exposure as a result of these downgrades. We provide credit to customers in the normal course of business. Credit is extended to new customers based upon checks of credit references and industry reputation. Credit is extended to existing customers based on prior payment history and demonstrated financial stability. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is generally limited due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $51.1 and $50.6 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. Our sales are generally dispersed to a large number of customers, minimizing the reliance on any particular customer or group of customers. Dell Inc., one of our channel partners, accounted for 11.5% and 14.3% of our revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties on an ongoing basis. We purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose customer orders. We attempt to minimize this risk by finding alternative suppliers or maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet our forecasted needs. 38 Table of Contents
