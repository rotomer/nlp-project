ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All dollar amounts expressed numerically in this MD&A are in millions. Certain tables may not add due to rounding. INTRODUCTION We manage our business in two broad categories: EMC Information Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure. EMC Information Infrastructure Our EMC Information Infrastructure business consists of three of our segments: Information Storage, Information Intelligence Group and RSA Information Security. The objective for our EMC Information Infrastructure business is to simultaneously invest in the business, increase our market share and improve our profitability. During 2010, we continued to invest in expanding our total addressable market opportunity through internal research and development (R&D) efforts and acquisitions to capitalize on the continued growth of enterprise data. Additionally, because of these investments, we believe we are well positioned at the intersection of two trends in Information Technology (IT) Cloud Computing and Big Data. Cloud Computing leverages an on demand, self managed, virtualized infrastructure to deliver IT as a Service in a more efficient, flexible and cost effective manner. While the fundamental transition to Cloud Computing architectures is only in the early stages, we believe our offerings are well suited to capitalize on this trend as it unfolds over the next several years. Big Data, which is a primary contributor to the staggering pace of data growth, refers to the large repositories of corporate and external data, including unstructured information created by social media and other web repositories. The tools and platforms surrounding Big Data require new approaches and capabilities to handle these data sets, particularly in managing the associated analytics that unlock the value contained within the massive amount of data. With the investments we made by acquiring Isilon and Greenplum, as well as our internally developed Atmos offering, we believe we are well positioned in this market. Through a combination of reinvesting for growth and growing faster than the markets we serve, we believe we will be able to increase our 2011 earnings at a rate faster than the rate at which we will grow our revenue and reinforce our position as the provider for enterprise data, cloud infrastructures and Big Data solutions. VMware Virtual Infrastructure VMwares current financial focus is on long term revenue growth to generate cash flows to fund its expansion of industry segment share and evolve its virtualization based products for data centers, desktop computers and cloud computing through a combination of internal development and acquisitions. VMware expects to grow its business by broadening its virtualization infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio, increasing product awareness, promoting the adoption of virtualization and building long term relationships with its customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements. Since the introduction in 2009 of VMware vSphere and VMware View 4, which is compatible with VMware vSphere, VMware has introduced more products that build on the vSphere foundation. In the third quarter of 2010, VMware released updated versions of VMware vSphere and VMware View, and VMware plans to continue to introduce additional products in the future. Additionally, VMware has made, and expects to continue to make, acquisitions designed to strengthen its product offerings and or extend its strategy to deliver solutions that can be hosted at customer data centers or at service providers. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues The following table presents revenue by our segments: Percentage Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs 2009 2009 vs 2008 Information Storage $ 12,699.1 $ 10,659.4 $ 11,632.3 19.1 % (8.4 )% Information Intelligence Group 735.9 739.6 785.6 (0.5 ) (5.9 ) RSA Information Security 729.4 606.0 581.3 20.4 4.2 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 2,850.7 2,021.0 1,876.9 41.1 7.7 Total revenues $ 17,015.1 $ 14,025.9 $ 14,876.2 21.3 % (5.7 )% 24 Table of Contents Consolidated product revenues increased 23.4% to $10,892.9 in 2010. The consolidated product revenues increases were primarily driven by the Information Storage and the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments product revenues. The Information Storage segments product revenues increased 22.6% to $8,824.3 in 2010. Within the high end of the Information Storage segment, our Symmetrix product revenues increased 24.9%. Within the mid tier platform products of the Information Storage segment, product revenues increased 26.8% in 2010, partly due to the annual impact of the addition of the Data Domain products in the third quarter of 2009. The overall growth in product revenues in 2010 reflects a continued higher demand for our IT infrastructure offerings to address the storage needs for continued information growth, particularly as customers continue to build out their own data centers to develop and support their private or public cloud infrastructures. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments product revenues increased 36.0% to $1,399.3 in 2010. VMwares license revenues continue to benefit from strong customer demand for the vSphere platform, a foundation to cloud computing and an increase in customer spending as the economic conditions of the industry improved. The Information Intelligence Group segments product revenues increased 3.2% to $269.1 in 2010. The RSA Information Security segments product revenues increased 17.6% to $400.2 in 2010. Increases in both segments were attributable to increased demand for software licenses. Consolidated product revenues declined 12.3% to $8,828.1 in 2009. The Information Storage segments product revenues decreased 12.9% to $7,198.1, the Information Intelligence Group segments product revenues declined 6.2% to $260.8 and the RSA Information Security segments product revenues declined 4.2% to $340.3 in 2009. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments product revenues declined 12.4% to $1,029.0 in 2009. The decline in product revenues across all segments in 2009 was primarily attributable to lower demand resulting from the challenging global economic environment and resulting negative impact in our customers IT purchases. Consolidated services revenues increased 17.8% to $6,122.3 in 2010. The consolidated services revenues increase were primarily driven by the Information Storage and the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments services revenues. The Information Storage segments services revenues increased 11.9% to $3,874.8 in 2010. The increases in services revenues were primarily attributable to higher demand for systems maintenance related services, which correlates to the increased sales in storage products. In addition, a growing demand for professional services and software maintenance also contributed to the increases in services revenues in 2010. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments services revenues increased 46.3% to $1,451.5 in 2010. The increases in services revenues were primarily attributable to growth in VMwares software maintenance revenues. In 2010, services revenues benefited from strong renewals, multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with software licenses. The Information Intelligence Group segments services revenues declined 2.5% to $466.8 in 2010. The decline in services revenues was primarily attributable to lower demand for professional services as customers transition from enterprise wide to application centric deployments. The RSA Information Security segments services revenues increased 23.9% to $329.2 in 2010. Services revenues increased due to an increase in professional services and maintenance revenues resulting from continued demand for support from our installed base. Consolidated services revenues increased 8.2% to $5,197.8 in 2009. The Information Storage segments services revenues increased 2.7% to $3,461.4 and the RSA Information Security segments services revenues increased 17.5% to $265.7 in 2009. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments services revenues increased 41.3% to $992.0 in 2009. The Information Intelligence Group segments services revenues declined 5.7% to $478.8 in 2009. Services revenues increased across all segments, excluding the Information Intelligence Group segment, in 2009 due to an increase in maintenance revenues resulting from continued demand for support from our installed base. The increased demand was partially offset by a decline in professional services revenue which was associated with the decline in product revenues. Consolidated revenues by geography were as follows: Percentage Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs 2009 2009 vs 2008 United States $ 9,152.4 $ 7,384.3 $ 7,990.8 23.9 % (7.6 )% Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,942.1 4,290.3 4,555.0 15.2 (5.8 ) Asia Pacific 1,965.2 1,603.1 1,640.1 22.6 (2.3 ) Latin America, Mexico and Canada 955.5 748.2 690.3 27.7 8.4 25 Table of Contents Revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 in all of our markets due to greater demand for our products and services offerings. Revenues decreased in 2009 in all of our markets, with the exception of Latin America, Mexico and Canada, due to the challenging global economic environment and resulting negative impact in customers IT purchases. Revenues increased in Latin America, Mexico and Canada primarily due to increased demand for our offerings. Changes in exchange rates contributed 0.2% to the overall revenue increase in 2010 compared to 2009. The impact of the change in rates was most significant in the Asia Pacific markets, primarily Australia and Japan, Canada and Brazil, partially offset by the Euro and the pound sterling. Changes in exchange rates negatively impacted revenue growth by 1.4% in 2009. The impact of the change in rates in 2009 was most significant in the European market, primarily Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Costs and Expenses The following table presents our costs and expenses, other income and net income attributable to EMC Corporation. Percentage Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs 2009 2009 vs 2008 Cost of revenue: Information Storage $ 5,836.4 $ 5,256.7 $ 5,670.1 11.0 % (7.3 )% Information Intelligence Group 258.2 274.8 305.6 (6.0 ) (10.1 ) RSA Information Security 221.6 186.5 170.6 18.8 9.3 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 425.3 316.3 268.7 34.5 17.7 Corporate reconciling items 242.7 246.8 238.7 (1.7 ) 3.4 Total cost of revenue 6,984.1 6,281.0 6,653.8 11.2 (5.6 ) Gross margins: Information Storage 6,862.7 5,402.7 5,962.2 27.0 (9.4 ) Information Intelligence Group 477.7 464.8 480.0 2.8 (3.2 ) RSA Information Security 507.8 419.5 410.7 21.0 2.1 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 2,425.5 1,704.7 1,608.2 42.3 6.0 Corporate reconciling items (242.7 ) (246.8 ) (238.7 ) (1.7 ) 3.4 Total gross margin 10,031.0 7,744.9 8,222.4 29.5 (5.8 ) Operating expenses: Research and development(1) 1,888.0 1,627.5 1,721.3 16.0 (5.4 ) Selling, general and administrative(2) 5,375.3 4,595.6 4,601.6 17.0 (0.1 ) In process research and development 85.8 (100.0 ) Restructuring and acquisition related charges 84.4 107.5 244.7 (21.5 ) (56.1 ) Total operating expenses 7,347.7 6,330.6 6,653.4 16.1 (4.9 ) Operating income 2,683.3 1,414.3 1,568.9 89.7 (9.9 ) Investment income, interest expense and other expenses (75.3 ) (39.7 ) 31.3 89.7 (226.8 ) Income before income taxes 2,608.0 1,374.6 1,600.2 89.7 (14.1 ) Income tax provision 638.3 252.8 280.4 152.5 (9.8 ) Net income 1,969.7 1,121.8 1,319.8 75.6 (15.0 ) Less: Net income attributable to the non controlling interest in VMware, Inc. (69.7 ) (33.7 ) (44.7 ) 106.8 (24.6 ) Net income attributable to EMC Corporation $ 1,900.0 $ 1,088.1 $ 1,275.1 74.6 % (14.7 )% (1) Amount includes corporate reconciling items of $287.4, $235.8 and $175.4 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Amount includes corporate reconciling items of $477.5, $495.5 and $367.2 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Gross Margins Our gross margin percentages were 59.0%, 55.2% and 55.3% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to the Information Storage segment, which increased overall gross margins by 189 basis points, the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment, which increased overall gross margins by 161 basis points, the RSA Information Security segment, which increased overall gross margins by 11 basis points and the Information Intelligence Group segment, which increased overall gross margins by 10 basis points. Also contributing to the increased overall 26 Table of Contents gross margin percentage was the decrease of corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and transition costs, which increased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 3 basis points. The decline in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to the Information Storage segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 17 basis points and the RSA Information Security segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 5 basis points. These declines were partially offset by the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment which improved overall gross margins by 11 basis points, and the Information Intelligence Group segment which improved overall gross margins by 7 basis points. The increase in corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and transition costs, decreased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 6 basis points. The transition costs represent the incremental costs incurred to transform our current cost structure to a more streamlined cost structure. For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation, restructuring and acquisition related charges, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and transition costs are recognized as corporate expenses and are not allocated among our various operating segments. The decrease of $4.1 in the corporate reconciling items in 2010 was attributable to a $12.5 decrease in restructuring charges and a $0.9 decrease in transition costs, partially offset by a $9.3 increase in stock based compensation expense. Acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense remained flat. The $9.3 increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and the full year impact of options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2009. The increase of $8.1 in the corporate reconciling items in 2009 was attributable to a $12.5 increase in restructuring charges, a $19.3 increase in stock based compensation expense and a $3.1 increase in transition costs, partially offset by a $26.8 decrease in acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense. The $19.3 increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to incremental expense associated with options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain and expense associated with VMwares equity grants. The decrease in intangible asset amortization expense in 2009 was attributable to acquisition related intangible assets acquired in acquisitions becoming fully amortized. The gross margin percentages for the Information Storage segment were 54.0%, 50.7% and 51.3% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to improved product gross margins, driven by an improved product mix attributable to higher margin product offerings, higher sales volume and an improved cost structure. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower sales volume and a greater mix of lower margin Iomega revenue. Iomega, acquired in June 2008, operates within the consumer and small business marketplace which historically has had lower gross margins than marketplaces typically served by our Information Storage segment. Partially offsetting these declines was an improvement in the gross margin attributable to a greater mix of higher margin services revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Services revenues as a percentage of total Information Storage segment revenues increased to 32.5% in 2009 from 29.0% in 2008. The gross margin percentages for Information Intelligence Group segment were 64.9%, 62.8% and 61.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 related to an increase in the product margins due to a decrease in the royalties paid for third party software embedded into the products in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of services revenues with a higher proportion of maintenance revenues and a lower proportion of professional services revenues to total services revenues. Maintenance revenues generally provide a higher margin percentage than professional services revenues. The gross margin percentages for the RSA Information Security segment were 69.6%, 69.2% and 70.6% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The slight increase in the gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to an increase in product margins partially offset by a decrease in services margins. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in product revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues. Product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 61.1% in 2008 and to 56.2% in 2009. The gross margin percentages for the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment were 85.1% in 2010, 84.4% in 2009 and 85.7% in 2008. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to improved services margins. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in the amortization of software development costs as a percentage of total segment revenues. The amortization of software development costs as a percentage of total segment revenues increased to 3.3% in 2009, compared to 2.3% in 2008. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 11.1%, 11.6% and 11.6% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. R&D expenses increased $260.5 in 2010 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs, including stock based compensation, depreciation expense, cost of facilities and travel costs, partially offset by greater levels of software capitalization. Personnel related costs increased by $250.6, depreciation expense increased by $23.4, cost of facilities increased by $19.4 and travel costs 27 Table of Contents increased by $9.4. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $66.3. R&D expenses decreased by $93.8 in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs, depreciation expense, materials costs and facilities costs. Personnel related costs decreased by $19.9, depreciation expense decreased by $19.1, the cost of materials to support new product development decreased by $14.0 and the cost of facilities decreased by $11.9. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $9.5. Corporate reconciling items within R&D, which consist of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and transition costs increased $51.6 and $60.4 to $287.4 and $235.8 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Stock based compensation expense increased $44.2 and $52.2 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Acquisition related intangible asset amortization increased $10.7 in 2010 and decreased $0.2 in 2009 and transition costs decreased $3.3 and increased $8.4 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Intangible asset amortization increased primarily due to VMware acquisitions and to the Data Domain acquisition, which was consummated in the third quarter of 2009. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2010 was attributable to the incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and the full year impact of options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2009 was primarily attributable to expense associated with options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. R&D expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 7.9%, 8.5% and 9.3% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. R&D expenses increased $100.7 in 2010 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, depreciation expense, cost of facilities and travel costs. Personnel related costs increased by $122.4, depreciation expense increased by $14.7, cost of facilities increased by $14.3 and travel costs increased $6.1. Partially offsetting these increased costs was an increase in capitalized software development costs of $74.2. R&D expenses decreased $181.6 in 2009 primarily due to a reduction in personnel related costs, facilities costs, materials costs and depreciation expense. Personnel related costs decreased by $99.0, the cost of facilities decreased by $18.2, the cost of materials to support new product development decreased by $14.0 and depreciation expense decreased by $13.4. In 2009, the cost reductions were primarily due to savings achieved as a result of our 2008 restructuring programs, our cost savings initiatives and greater levels of capitalized software development. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $31.8. The increase in capitalized software development costs is attributable to the timing of efforts associated with new product development. R&D expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 16.8%, 18.3% and 18.2% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. R&D expenses increased $108.3 in 2010 largely due to increases in personnel related costs of $87.3, primarily due to increased salaries and benefits expenses resulting from incremental headcount from strategic hiring and acquisitions. Additionally, capitalized software development costs decreased $7.9 in 2010 primarily due to lower costs capitalized on products that build on the VMware vSphere foundation in 2010. R&D expenses increased $27.3 in 2009 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs, including salaries and benefits which increased $18.4 due to incremental headcount from strategic hiring and a decrease in capitalized software development costs, partially offset by decreased costs resulting from the austerity measures implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, decreased by $22.3 in 2009 when compared to 2008 as VMware vSphere became generally available in 2009. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 31.6%, 32.8% and 30.9% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. SG&A expenses increased by $779.7 in 2010 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, commissions, travel costs, business development costs, cost of facilities and depreciation expense. Personnel related costs increased by $439.4, commissions increased by $168.1, travel costs increased by $73.3, business development costs increased by $43.7, cost of facilities increased by $35.6 and depreciation expense increased by $28.5 in 2010. SG&A expenses decreased by $6.0 in 2009 driven by the cost reduction efforts implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. Personnel related costs, travel, supplies and other administrative costs declined by $103.3. Additionally, our provisions for bad debts decreased by $20.3. Partially offsetting these decreased costs were $57.5 for a provision for litigation, increased commissions of $53.3 and increased depreciation of $26.6. Corporate reconciling items within SG&A, which consist of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, provision for litigation and transition costs decreased $18.0 to $477.5 in 2010 and increased $128.3 to $495.5 in 2009. Intangible asset amortization increased $26.8, stock based compensation expense increased $25.9 and transition costs decreased $13.2 in 2010. Additionally, the provision for litigation of $57.5 in 2009 did not recur in 2010. Intangible asset amortization increased primarily due to VMware acquisitions and to the Data Domain acquisition, which was consummated in the third quarter of 2009. Stock based compensation expense increased in 2010 due to the incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and the full year impact of options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. In 2009, we incurred $57.5 for a provision for litigation, stock based compensation expense increased $32.8 and transition costs increased $43.1. 28 Table of Contents Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense of $5.1. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2009 was primarily attributable to incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and expense associated with options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. SG&A expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 26.4%, 27.1% and 26.8% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. SG&A expenses increased $479.0 in 2010 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, commissions, travel costs, business development costs, cost of facilities and depreciation. Personnel related costs increased by $258.8, commissions increased by $108.4, travel costs increased by $52.0, business development costs increased by $35.3, cost of facilities increased by $21.1 and depreciation expense increased by $14.9. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in professional services costs of $12.3. SG&A expenses decreased by $228.8 in 2009 driven by the cost reduction efforts implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. Personnel related costs, travel, supplies and other administrative costs declined by $228.0. Additionally, our provisions for bad debts decreased by $21.2. Partially offsetting these decreased costs was an increase in depreciation expense of $15.8. SG&A expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 40.7%, 41.7% and 39.8% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. SG&A expenses increased $318.7 in 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2010 was primarily the result of higher salaries and benefits costs resulting from incremental headcount from strategic hiring and acquisitions as well as commission expense on higher sales volumes. Also contributing to the change was increased spending on marketing programs. SG&A expenses increased $94.5 in 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2009 consisted primarily of higher commissions, increased salaries and benefits resulting from increased sales volume and incremental headcount added in conjunction with VMwares international expansion, as well as increased spending to enhance the sales and marketing systems infrastructure of its business. These cost increases were partially offset by decreased travel and entertainment costs resulting from the austerity measures implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008 and decreased marketing program expenses as compared with VMwares branding initiative in 2008. These austerity measures included, but were not limited to, reduced travel and entertainment costs, decreased contractor costs and hiring limited to roles that fit VMware strategic initiatives. In Process Research and Development In connection with acquisitions in 2010 and 2009, we acquired and capitalized $43.9 and $175.0 of in process research and development (IPR&D), respectively. Projects acquired in 2010 are expected to be completed in 2012. Projects related to the IPR&D acquired in 2009 were completed in 2010. As a result of accounting rule changes which were effective at the beginning of 2009, IPR&D resulting from business combinations was capitalized as an asset with amortization commencing upon completion of the project. It was expensed at the time of acquisition prior to 2009. IPR&D expense was $85.8 in 2008. The value assigned to the IPR&D was determined utilizing the income approach by determining cash flow projections relating to the identified IPR&D projects. The stage of completion of each in process project was estimated to determine the discount rates to be applied to the valuation of the in process technology. Based upon the level of completion and the risk associated with the in process technology, we applied discount rates ranging from 19% to 22% to value the IPR&D projects acquired in 2010, 17% to 21% to the value of projects acquired in 2009 and 20% to 60% for amounts expensed related to IPR&D projects in 2008. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Charges In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we incurred restructuring and acquisition related charges of $84.4, $107.5 and $250.3, respectively. In 2010, we incurred $76.7 of restructuring charges, of which $37.8 related to our fourth quarter 2010 program. The remainder was primarily related to our 2008 restructuring program and $7.7 of costs in connection with acquisitions for financial advisory, legal and accounting services. Our 2008 restructuring program includes the consolidation of facilities. We will incur restructuring charges of $29.2 through 2015 as we vacate these facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we implemented a restructuring program to create further operational efficiencies which will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 400 positions. The program resulted in a charge of $37.8. The action will impact positions around the globe covering our Information Storage, RSA Information Security and Information Intelligence Group segments. The actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2011. In 2009, we incurred $88.4 of restructuring charges and $19.1 of costs in connection with acquisitions for financial advisory, legal and accounting services. In 2008, all charges only relate to restructuring activities. (See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 29 Table of Contents Investment Income Investment income was $142.5, $140.4 and $247.0 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Investment income increased slightly in 2010 primarily due to increased interest income on our sales type leases. The weighted average return on investments, excluding realized gains, was 1.2%, 1.3% and 3.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net realized gains were $15.8, $20.8 and $6.6 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense was $178.3, $182.5 and $176.4 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our convertible debt. Included in interest expense are non cash interest charges related to amortization of the debt discount attributable to the conversion feature of $114.5, $108.3 and $102.6 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We are accreting our convertible debt to their stated values over their term. (See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $(39.5), $2.4 and $(39.4) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other expense in 2010 was primarily attributable to our consolidated share of the losses from our cloud infrastructure joint venture, VCE Company LLC, of $42.8. This joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. Other income in 2009 was primarily attributable to gains on strategic investments. The increase in 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 24.5%, 18.4% and 17.5% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is substantially lower than our income tax rate in the United States. In 2010, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 12.2 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. In 2010, we effected a plan to reorganize our international operations by transferring certain assets of Isilon, Archer Technologies and Bus Tech entities into a single EMC international holding company. As a result of this reorganization, we incurred an income tax charge which negatively impacted the rate by 3.2 percentage points. We had a reduction in our valuation allowance which arose from the utilization of a certain subsidiarys foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a benefit to our effective tax rate of 0.6 percentage points. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences, resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations and other items collectively decreased the rate by 0.9 percentage points. In 2009, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 17.5 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 4.5 percentage points. In 2009, we effected a plan to reorganize our international operations by transferring certain assets of our RSA and Data Domain entities and legacy foreign corporations owned directly by EMC into a single EMC international holding company. As a result of this reorganization, we incurred income taxes which negatively impacted the rate by 4.4 percentage points. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances and other items collectively increased the rate by 1.0 percentage point, driven principally by non deductible permanent differences. In 2008, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 15.9 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 2.9 percentage points. The net effect of non deductible permanent differences, state taxes, tax credits and other items was an increase to the rate of 1.3 percentage points. The effective tax rate increased from 2009 to 2010 by 6.1%, from 18.4% to 24.5%. This increase was principally attributable to differences in the composition of the income in different countries and the favorable resolution of income tax audits in 2009, which was partially offset by reductions in our non deductible permanent differences and the reorganization of our international operations. The effective tax rate increased from 2008 to 2009 by 0.9%, from 17.5% to 18.4%. This increase was principally attributable to the reorganization of RSA and Data Domain in 2009, which was partially offset by incremental benefits from the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions inclusive of the expiration of statutes of limitation. 30 Table of Contents Non controlling Interest in VMware, Inc. The net income attributable to the non controlling interest in VMware was $69.7, $33.7 and $44.7 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. VMwares reported net income was $357.4, $197.1 and $290.1 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The weighted average non controlling interest in VMware was approximately 19.5%, 17.0% and 15.0% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the first quarter of 2010, we announced a stock purchase program of VMwares Class A common stock to maintain an approximately 80% majority ownership in VMware over the long term. We have purchased approximately 6.0 million shares as of December 31, 2010 for $399.2. Financial Condition Cash provided by operating activities was $4,548.8, $3,334.4 and $3,565.1 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash received from customers was $17,585.4, $14,647.7 and $15,378.1 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, the increase was attributable to an increase in sales volume and higher cash proceeds from the sale of maintenance contracts, which are typically billed and paid in advance of services being rendered. In 2009, the decrease was attributable to a reduction in sales volume. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $12,830.7, $11,032.9 and $11,747.0 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount and related employee expenses, material costs correlated to higher sales volume and other operating expenses. In 2009, the decrease was attributable to a reduction in purchases associated with a reduction in sales volume and a decrease in compensation costs. Cash received from dividends and interest was $102.9, $109.5 and $240.0 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid $232.1, $316.5 and $232.3, respectively, in income taxes. These payments are comprised of estimated taxes for the current year, extension payments for the prior year and refunds or payments associated with income tax filings and tax audits. Cash used in investing activities was $6,476.0, $3,095.5 and $1,614.9 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash paid for acquisitions, strategic investments and other related investments was $3,108.7, $2,847.1 and $731.0 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, we acquired Isilon for $2,301.1, net of cash acquired, and in 2009, we acquired Data Domain for $1,933.9, net of cash acquired. Capital additions were $745.4, $411.6 and $695.9 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher level of capital additions in 2010 was primarily due to an increase in spending on facility expansion and information technology infrastructure for 2010. In 2009, the lower level of capital additions was due to lower spending on infrastructure as part of our 2009 cost savings initiatives. Capitalized software development costs were $363.0, $304.5 and $295.0 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was primarily attributable to EMC Information Infrastructures efforts on its software development activities. Net purchases of investments were $2,259.0 in 2010 compared to net sales and maturities of $466.6 and $75.1 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. This activity varies from period to period based upon our cash collections, cash requirements and maturity dates of our investments. Cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(243.8), $211.9 and $(534.0) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010 and 2008, we spent $999.9 and $1,489.5 to repurchase 52.7 million and 112.2 million shares of EMC common stock, respectively. We additionally spent $399.2 to purchase 6.0 million shares of VMware common stock and VMware spent $338.5 to repurchase 4.9 million shares of its common stock in 2010. We made no share repurchases in 2009. We generated $1,212.0, $594.0 and $431.2 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares within the employee stock plans. Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period during the three months ended December 31, 2010, the convertible senior debt of $1,725, 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and our $1,725, 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes and, together with the 2011 Notes, the Notes) are convertible at the option of the holder through March 31, 2011. Upon conversion, we are obligated to pay cash up to the principal amount of the debt converted. We have the option to settle any conversion value in excess of the principal amount with cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. Additionally, $1,725 of the Notes are due in November 2011. The remaining $1,725 of the Notes is due in November 2013. At maturity, we are obligated to pay cash up to the principal amount of the debt. We have the option to settle any conversion value in excess of the principal amount with cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock. These will generally have the effect of offsetting the cash outlay which may be paid by EMC for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. 31 Table of Contents See Note E to the consolidated financial statements. We have available for use a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. As of December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the banks base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate amount of liabilities of our subsidiaries was approximately $4,891.1. At December 31, 2010, our total cash, cash equivalents, and short term and long term investments were $9,491.2. This balance includes approximately $3,323.6 held by VMware and $1,549.4 held by EMC in overseas entities. Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Results EMC uses certain non GAAP financial measures, which exclude stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and acquisition related charges, infrequently occurring gains and losses, special tax items and provision for litigation to measure its gross margin, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share. EMC also assesses its financial performance by measuring its free cash flow which is also a non GAAP financial measure. These non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMCs financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMCs non GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non GAAP financial measures. EMCs management uses the non GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of EMCs comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes these items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segments financial goals. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. These non GAAP financial measures are used by EMCs management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect EMCs ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons. EMCs management believes that these non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMCs current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner EMCs current financial results with EMCs past financial results. Our non GAAP operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: For the Three Months Ended For the Year Ended December 31,2010 December 31,2009 December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Gross margin $ 3,028.4 $ 2,444.3 $ 10,271.4 $ 7,988.5 Gross margin percentage 61.9 % 59.6 % 60.4 % 57.0 % Operating income 1,243.0 916.5 3,738.0 2,445.2 Operating income percentage 25.4 % 22.4 % 22.0 % 17.4 % Income tax provision 249.8 168.2 824.0 452.1 Net income attributable to EMC 920.1 695.5 2,715.3 1,858.4 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.42 $ 0.33 $ 1.26 $ 0.90 The improvements in the non GAAP gross margin and non GAAP gross margin percentage were attributable to higher sales volume, a change in mix attributable to higher margin product offerings and improved cost control. The improvements in the non GAAP operating income and non GAAP operating income percentage were attributable to an improved gross margin percentage and growing revenues faster than both our R&D and SG&A expenses. Non GAAP R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 8.5% and 8.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 9.4% and 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Non GAAP SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 28.0% and 28.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 29.0% and 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also monitor our ability to generate free cash flow in relationship to our non GAAP net income attributable to EMC. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our free cash flow was $3,440.5, an increase of 31.4% compared to the free cash flow generated for the year ended December 31, 2009. The free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 exceeded our non GAAP net income attributable to EMC by $725.2. 32 Table of Contents The reconciliation of the above financial measures from GAAP to non GAAP is as follows: For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 GAAP Provisionforlitigation Gain onstrategicinvestments Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges Specialtax charge Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Non GAAP Gross margin $ 2,966.3 $ $ $ $ $ 28.9 $ 33.2 $ 3,028.4 Operating income 943.7 43.5 185.4 70.4 1,243.0 Income tax provision 257.0 6.8 (83.3 ) 45.2 24.1 249.8 Net income attributable to EMC 628.6 36.7 83.3 126.9 44.6 920.1 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.29 $ $ $ 0.02 $ 0.04 $ 0.06 $ 0.02 $ 0.42 For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2009 GAAP Provisionforlitigation Gain onstrategicinvestments Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges Specialtax charge Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Non GAAP Gross margin $ 2,377.6 $ $ $ $ $ 30.1 $ 36.5 $ 2,444.3 Operating income 587.6 57.5 23.9 181.6 65.9 916.5 Income tax provision 156.3 5.2 9.1 (60.7 ) 36.8 21.4 168.2 Net income attributable to EMC 390.6 52.3 14.6 60.7 133.2 44.0 695.5 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.19 $ 0.03 $ $ 0.01 $ 0.03 $ 0.06 $ 0.02 $ 0.33 For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 GAAP Provisionforlitigation Gain onstrategicinvestments Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges Specialtax charge Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Non GAAP Gross margin $ 10,031.0 $ $ $ $ $ 108.7 $ 131.8 $ 10,271.4 Operating income 2,683.3 84.4 685.1 285.3 3,738.0 Income tax provision 638.3 10.7 (83.3 ) 165.7 92.7 824.0 Net income attributable to EMC 1,900.0 72.0 83.3 472.7 187.3 2,715.3 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.88 $ $ $ 0.03 $ 0.04 $ 0.22 $ 0.09 $ 1.26 For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 GAAP Provisionforlitigation Gain onstrategicinvestments Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges Specialtax charge Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Non GAAP Gross margin $ 7,744.9 $ $ $ 12.5 $ $ 99.4 $ 131.8 $ 7,988.5 Operating income 1,414.3 57.5 120.0 605.7 247.8 2,445.2 Income tax provision 252.8 5.2 35.9 (60.7 ) 135.1 83.8 452.1 Net income attributable to EMC 1,088.1 52.3 (24.8 ) 83.8 60.7 435.8 162.4 1,858.4 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.53 $ 0.03 $ (0.01 ) $ 0.04 $ 0.03 $ 0.21 $ 0.08 $ 0.90 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statements of cash flows. 33 Table of Contents The reconciliation of the above free cash flow from GAAP to non GAAP is as follows: For the Three Months Ended For the Year Ended December 31,2010 December 31,2009 December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Cash Flow from Operations $ 1,512.2 $ 1,008.7 $ 4,548.8 $ 3,334.4 Capital Expenditures (203.5 ) (134.0 ) (745.4 ) (411.6 ) Capitalized Software Development Costs (90.5 ) (82.1 ) (363.0 ) (304.5 ) Free Cash Flow $ 1,218.2 $ 792.6 $ 3,440.5 $ 2,618.3 Free cash flow represents a non GAAP measure related to operating cash flows. In contrast, our GAAP measures of cash flow consist of three components. These are cash flows provided by operating activities of $4,548.8 and $3,334.4 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, cash used in investing activities of $6,476.0 and $3,095.5 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, net cash used in financing activities of $243.8 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and net cash provided by financing activities of $211.9 for the year ended December 31, 2009. All of the foregoing non GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMCs operations or cash flows. Further, these non GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMCs financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investments The following table summarizes the composition of our investments at December 31, 2010: AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains Unrealized(Losses) AggregateFair Value U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,737.8 $ 11.3 $ (2.7 ) $ 1,746.4 U.S. corporate debt securities 1,239.3 13.6 (1.3 ) 1,251.6 High yield corporate debt securities 421.5 18.3 (1.9 ) 437.8 Asset backed securities 34.7 0.2 34.9 Municipal obligations 1,095.3 3.8 (3.3 ) 1,095.9 Auction rate securities 156.0 (9.9 ) 146.0 Foreign debt securities 653.3 6.9 (0.7 ) 659.4 Total $ 5,337.8 $ 54.1 $ (19.8 ) $ 5,372.1 Our investments are comprised primarily of debt securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair market values. At December 31, 2010, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by third party pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. For all of our securities where the amortized cost basis was greater than the fair value at December 31, 2010, we have concluded that currently we neither plan to sell the security nor is it more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. In making the determination as to whether the unrealized loss is other than temporary, we considered the length of time and extent the investment has been in an unrealized loss position, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the issuers credit rating, third party guarantees and the time to maturity. 34 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years* 3 5 years** More than5 years Operating leases $ 1,291.9 $ 267.1 $ 544.7 $ 104.2 $ 375.9 Convertible debt 3,450.0 3,450.0 Product warranty obligations 236.1 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations and post retirement obligations 217.4 120.9 1.8 0.6 1.8 Purchase orders 1,236.6 1,189.0 47.6 Uncertain tax positions 230.3 Total $ 6,662.3 $ 5,027.0 $ 594.1 $ 104.8 $ 377.7 *Includes payments from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014. **Includes payments from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2010, we had $236.1 of product warranty obligations, $92.3 of long term post retirement obligations and $230.3 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancellable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space in most cases is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The convertible debt pertains to the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. Holders may convert their Notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding (i) September 1, 2011, with respect to the 2011 Notes, and (ii) September 1, 2013, with respect to the 2013 Notes, in each case only under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the price per Note of the applicable series for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Notes. Additionally, the Notes will become convertible during the last three months prior to the respective maturities of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period during the three months ended December 31, 2010, the contingent conversion threshold on the Notes was exceeded. As a result, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder through March 31, 2011. Accordingly, since the terms of the Notes require the principal to be settled in cash, we reclassified from equity the portion of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature which had not yet been accreted to its face value and the Notes have been classified as a current liability. For the holders to be able to continue to convert the 2013 Notes, our closing stock price must exceed $20.90 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days of each future quarter. If this threshold is not met, the 2013 Notes will be reclassified to long term debt. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $106.0 as of December 31, 2010. The 35 Table of Contents guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions. EMC and certain of its subsidiaries have also entered into arrangements with financial institutions in order to facilitate the management of currency risk. EMC has agreed to guarantee the obligations of its subsidiaries under these arrangements. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and or copyright. Certain agreements in which we grant limited licenses to specific EMC trademarks require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that the use of the licensed trademark infringes a third party trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to real or tangible personal property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time, we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have also made certain guarantees for the lease obligations of affiliated third parties. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. We have agreed to indemnify the directors, executive officers and certain other officers of EMC and our subsidiaries, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2010, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2010 is not material. Pension We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the United States. Certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. All of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for these defined benefit plans are invested in common stocks and bonds. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2010 was lowered from 8.25% to 6.75%. This rate represents the average of the expected long term rates of return weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2010. The Company has begun to shift, and may continue to shift in the future, its asset allocation to lower the percentage of investments in equity securities and increase the percentage of investments in fixed income securities. The effect of such a change results in a reduction to the long term rate of return on plan assets and an increase in future pension expense consistent with the sensitivity described below. As of December 31, 2010, the ten year historical rate of return on plan assets was 4.1% and the inception to date return on plan assets was 9.8%. In 2010 and 2009, we experienced a 12.6% and 25.1% gain on plan assets, respectively. Based upon current market conditions and the target allocation of the plans assets, the expected long term rate of return for 2011 is 6.75%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a $0.9 impact on the 2011 pension expense. As of December 31, 2010, the pension plan had a $187.7 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants of 11.6 years. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 5.4%. This rate represents the average of the discount rate weighted by the plans liabilities as of December 31, 2010. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated AA or higher from a reputable rating agency. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively 36 Table of Contents settled. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.8 impact on the 2011 pension expense for all plans. Additionally, certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans. These foreign pension plans are excluded from this discussion because they do not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the areas set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The application of the appropriate guidance within the Accounting Standards Codification to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes information systems, including hardware storage and hardware related devices, software, including required storage operating systems and optional value added software application programs, and services, including installation, professional, software and hardware maintenance and training, or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including estimates of fair value and selling price in arrangements with multiples deliverables, assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. We estimate systems warranty costs based upon historical experience, specific identification of system requirements and projected costs to service items under warranty. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. To the extent that our actual systems warranty costs differed from our estimates by 5 percent, consolidated pre tax income would have increased/decreased by approximately $11.8 and $13.6 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The market value of our short and long term investments is based primarily upon the listed price of the security. At December 31, 2010, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. In the event the fair market values that we determine are not accurate or we are unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner, we may not realize the recorded value of our investments. We hold investments whose market value is below our cost. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the time to maturity, length of the impairment, magnitude of the 37 Table of Contents impairment and ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and our levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, at least annually, in the fourth quarter of each year. Our assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which, for certain of our operating segments, is one step below our segment level. For each assessment, we compare the market value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimate fair value by employing different methodologies, including a comparison to comparable industry companies and several different discounted cash flow methodologies. At December 31, 2010, there was sufficient cushion between the market value of the reporting units compared to their carrying value so that we do not expect any near term change in the operating results that would cause an impairment. The determination of relevant comparable industry companies impacts our assessment of fair value. Should the operating performance of our reporting units change in comparison to these companies or should the valuation of these companies change, this could impact our assessment of the fair value of the reporting units. Our discounted cash flow analyses factor in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates. These estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Additionally, these discounted cash flow analyses factor in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2010, 2009, 2008 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions, negotiations with third parties and finalization of severance agreements with employees. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. Accounting for Stock based Compensation For our share based payment awards, we make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options, including volatility, expected life and forfeiture rates. Additionally, for awards which are performance based, we make estimates as to the probability of the underlying performance being achieved. Changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the value and timing of stock based compensation expense recognized, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to foreign exchange risk, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the pound sterling. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 based on scenarios in which market spot rates are hypothetically changed in order to produce a potential net exposure loss. The hypothetical change is based on a 10 percent strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar, whereby all other variables are held constant. The analyses include all of our foreign currency contracts outstanding as of December 31 for each year, as well as the offsetting underlying exposures. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of $3.6, $1.2 and $2.2 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or temporary non credit related loss recorded in other comprehensive loss. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We employ a Historical Value At Risk calculation to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last 180 days are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the investment portfolios was $4.4 as of December 31, 2010 and $3.9 as of December 31, 2009. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Average High Low 2010 $ 4.4 $ 6.7 $ 3.0 2009 $ 4.5 $ 5.2 $ 3.9 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of bank deposits, money market investments, short and long term investments, accounts and notes receivable, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks in the United States may exceed the amount of FDIC insurance provided on such deposits. Deposits held 39 Table of Contents with banks outside the United States generally do not benefit from FDIC insurance. The majority of our day to day banking operations globally are maintained with Citibank. We believe that Citibanks position as a primary clearing bank, coupled with the substantial monitoring of their daily liquidity, both by their internal processes and by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, mitigate some of our risk. Our money market investments are placed with money market funds that are 2a 7 qualified. Rule 2a 7, adopted by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, establishes strict standards for quality, diversity and maturity, the objective of which is to maintain a constant net asset value of a dollar. We limit our investments in money market funds to those that are primarily associated with large, money center financial institutions. Our short and long term investments are invested primarily in investment grade securities, and we limit the amount of our investment in any single issuer. We provide credit to customers in the normal course of business. Credit is extended to new customers based upon checks of credit references, credit scores and industry reputation. Credit is extended to existing customers based on prior payment history and demonstrated financial stability. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is generally limited due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $60.5 and $51.1 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. Our sales are generally dispersed to a large number of customers, minimizing the reliance on any particular customer or group of customers. Dell Inc., one of our channel partners, accounted for 11.5% of our revenues in 2008. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties on an ongoing basis. We purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose customer orders. We attempt to minimize this risk by finding alternative suppliers or maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet our forecasted needs. 40 Table of Contents
