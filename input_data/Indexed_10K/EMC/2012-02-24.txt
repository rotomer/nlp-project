ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All dollar amounts expressed numerically in this MD&A are in millions. Certain tables may not add due to rounding. INTRODUCTION We manage our business in two broad categories: EMC Information Infrastructure and VMware Virtual Infrastructure. EMC Information Infrastructure Our EMC Information Infrastructure business consists of three segments: Information Storage, Information Intelligence and RSA Information Security. The objective for our EMC Information Infrastructure business is to simultaneously increase our market share, invest in the business and improve our financial returns. During 2011, we continued to innovate and invest in expanding our total addressable market through internal research and development (R&D) and our recent acquisitions to capitalize on the continued expansion of enterprise data. We have developed a product portfolio with customers current and future needs in mind which will continue to evolve as the largest transformation in Information Technology (IT) history is creating enormous opportunities in Cloud Computing and Big Data. Cloud Computing leverages an on demand, self managed, virtualized infrastructure to deliver IT as a Service in a more efficient, flexible and cost effective manner. While the fundamental transition to Cloud Computing architectures is gaining traction, customers are increasingly recognizing that their ability to compete is tied to the efficiency, flexibility and agility of their IT operations and that transitioning to a cloud based architecture will be a key component to their success. We believe our offerings are well suited to capitalize on this trend as it unfolds over the next several years. Big Data, which is a primary contributor to the pace of overall data growth, refers to the large repositories of corporate and external data, including unstructured information created by new applications (e.g. medical, entertainment, energy and geophysical), social media and other web repositories. With the investments we made in 2010 by acquiring Isilon and Greenplum, as well as our internally developed Atmos offering, we believe we are well positioned in this market to continue assisting our customers in storing, managing and unlocking the value contained within this information. Our powerful go to market model, where we continue to leverage our direct sales force and services organization, as well as our channel and services partners and service providers, positioned us well during 2011 to help customers transition to Cloud Computing and benefit from Big Data. Additionally, momentum continues to build at VCE Company LLC, our joint venture with Cisco, and other investors VMware and Intel, as it becomes an important element of our go to market model, with their Vblock converged infrastructure product for building out cloud data centers. VMware Virtual Infrastructure VMwares financial focus is on long term revenue growth to generate free cash flows to fund its expansion of industry segment share and evolve its virtualization based products for data centers, desktop computers and cloud computing through a combination of internal development and acquisitions. VMware expects to grow its business by broadening its virtualization infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio, increasing product awareness, promoting the adoption of virtualization and building long term relationships with its customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements (ELAs). Since the introduction of VMware vSphere in 2009, VMware has introduced more products that build on the vSphere foundation including VMware vSphere 5 and a comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies, as well as VMware View 5. VMware plans to continue to introduce additional products in the future. Additionally, VMware has made, and expects to continue to make, acquisitions designed to strengthen its product offerings and or extend its strategy to deliver solutions that can be hosted at customer data centers or at service providers. On a consolidated basis, our vision, strategy and roadmap allowed us to leverage our strengths through 2011 and position us to capitalize on the evolving trends of Cloud Computing and Big Data in 2012. As a result, we believe we will grow faster than the markets we serve in 2012 while simultaneously investing in the business and growing earnings per share at a rate faster than the rate at which we will grow our revenue. 25 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues The following table presents revenue by our segments: Percentage Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs 2010 2010 vs 2009 Information Storage $ 14,714.2 $ 12,699.1 $ 10,659.4 15.9 % 19.1 % Information Intelligence Group 702.4 735.9 739.6 (4.6 ) (0.5 ) RSA Information Security 828.2 729.4 606.0 13.5 20.4 VMware Virtual Infrastructure 3,762.9 2,850.7 2,021.0 32.0 41.1 Total revenues $ 20,007.6 $ 17,015.1 $ 14,025.9 17.6 % 21.3 % Consolidated product revenues increased 15.6% to $12,590.7 in 2011. The consolidated product revenues increase was primarily driven by the Information Storage and the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments product revenues. The overall growth in product revenue in 2011 was due to a continued higher demand for our IT infrastructure offerings to address the storage and virtualization needs for continued information growth, particularly as customers continue to build out their own data centers to develop and support their private or public cloud infrastructures. The Information Storage segments product revenues increased 14.3% to $10,090.3 in 2011. Within the high end of the Information Storage segment, our Symmetrix product revenues increased 14.5%, primarily due to VMAX system sales and upgrades as customers continue to purchase VMAX for mission critical data sets and business applications as well as for new use cases. Within the mid tier of the Information Storage segment, which includes Unified products, Backup and Recovery Systems, EMC Isilon and EMC Atmos, product revenues increased 24.7% in 2011 due to strong performance across each of our mid tier product groups. Within Unified products, our VNX family, which includes VNX and VNXe, was launched in the first quarter of 2011 and has been well received by the market, bringing in almost 2,000 new customers in the fourth quarter of 2011 alone. Our Backup and Recovery Systems products have become an essential part of our strategic offerings as Data Domain product growth continued to benefit from being owned by EMC which in turn helped drive growth in our Avamar and NetWorker products. EMC Isilon, which was acquired at the end of 2010, contributed to our mid tier product growth as its revenues were included in our results for a full year in 2011 as compared to 2010. Finally, our Big Data storage and data analytics products continued to grow faster than the market with EMC Isilon revenue more than doubling in 2011 as compared to 2010 as an independent company, and EMC Greenplum expanding its offerings from a single product to a portfolio of products which includes a unified solution for Big Data analytics. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments product revenues increased 31.5% to $1,840.1 in 2011. VMwares license revenues increased in 2011 primarily due to strong global demand for vSphere. VMware observed an increase in the volume of ELAs in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to growing customer interest as well as strong renewals from existing ELA customers. The Information Intelligence Group segments product revenues declined 18.5% to $219.5 in 2011. The decrease in product revenues was primarily attributable to changing customer demand. The Information Intelligence Group segment continues to evolve to meet the buying preferences of todays content management customers by transitioning to lighter weight, content enabled applications using modern virtualized frameworks. The RSA Information Security segments product revenues increased 10.2% to $440.8 in 2011. The increase in product revenues was primarily due to increased demand for our Security Management and Compliance products. Consolidated product revenues increased 23.4% to $10,892.9 in 2010.

The increase in product revenues across all segments in 2010 was primarily attributable to continued higher demand for our IT infrastructure offerings to address the storage and virtualization needs for continued information growth, particularly as customers continue to build out their own data centers to develop and support their private or public cloud infrastructures. Consolidated services revenues increased 21.1% to $7,416.8 in 2011. The consolidated services revenues increase was primarily driven by the Information Storage and the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments services revenues where we continue to provide expertise to customers on the most effective ways to enable Cloud Computing and to leverage their Big Data assets. 26 Table of Contents The Information Storage segments services revenues increased 19.3% to $4,623.8 in 2011. The increase in services revenues was primarily attributable to higher demand for maintenance related services, which correlates to the increased sales in storage products. In addition, a growing demand for professional services also contributed to the increase in services revenues. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments services revenues increased 32.5% to $1,922.7 in 2011. The increase in services revenues was primarily attributable to growth in VMwares software maintenance revenues. In 2011, services revenues benefited from strong renewals, multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with new software license sales. Additionally, VMware experienced increased demand in their professional services driven by the growth in their license sales and installed base. The Information Intelligence Group segments services revenues increased 3.5% to $482.9 in 2011. The increase in services revenues was primarily attributable to higher sales of software maintenance contracts. The RSA Information Security segments services revenues increased 17.7% to $387.4 in 2011. Services revenues increased due to an increase in professional services and maintenance revenues resulting from continued demand for support from our installed base. Consolidated services revenues increased 17.8% to $6,122.3 in 2010. The consolidated services revenues increase was primarily driven by the Information Storage and the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segments services revenues.

(2) Amount includes corporate reconciling items of $606.4, $477.5 and $495.5 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gross Margins Our gross margin percentages were 60.8%, 59.0% and 55.2% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment, which increased overall gross margins by 140 basis points, and the Information Storage segment, which increased overall gross margins by 124 basis points, partially offset by the RSA Information Security segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 53 basis points, and the Information Intelligence Group segment, which decreased overall gross margins by 3 basis points. The increase in corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and transition costs, decreased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 22 basis points. Transition costs represent the incremental costs incurred to streamline our current cost structure. The increase in the gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to the Information Storage segment, which increased overall gross margins by 189 basis points, the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment, which increased overall gross margins by 161 basis points, the RSA Information Security segment, which increased overall gross margins by 11 basis points and the Information Intelligence Group segment, which increased overall gross margins by 10 basis points. Also contributing to the increased overall gross margin percentage was the decrease of corporate reconciling items, consisting of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and transition costs, which increased the consolidated gross margin percentage by 3 basis points. 28 Table of Contents For segment reporting purposes, stock based compensation, restructuring and acquisition related charges, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and transition costs are recognized as corporate expenses and are not allocated among our various operating segments. The increase of $39.7 in the corporate reconciling items in 2011 was attributable to a $25.4 increase in intangible asset amortization expense and a $15.0 increase in stock based compensation expense, partially offset by a $0.7 decrease in transition costs. The $15.0 increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and the full year impact of options exchanged in the acquisition of Isilon, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease of $4.1 in the corporate reconciling items in 2010 was attributable to a $12.5 decrease in restructuring charges and a $0.9 decrease in transition costs, partially offset by a $9.3 increase in stock based compensation expense. Acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense was flat. The $9.3 increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and the full year impact of options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2009. The gross margin percentages for the Information Storage segment were 56.4%, 54.0% and 50.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2011 compared to 2010 and in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to improved product gross margins, driven by a shift in product mix towards higher margin products, higher sales volume and an improved cost structure. The gross margin percentages for the RSA Information Security segment were 56.8%, 69.6% and 69.2% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to a decrease in product margins. The decrease in product margins was caused by costs accrued associated with working with our customers to implement remediation programs in the first quarter of 2011 and to the $66.3 charge related to the expansion of the customer remediation programs that we recorded in the second quarter of 2011. We expanded our customer remediation programs in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the heightened customer concerns resulting from press coverage related to an unsuccessful cyber attack on one of our defense sector customers, as well as broad media coverage of cyber attacks on other high profile organizations. The slight increase in the gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to an increase in product margins partially offset by a decrease in services margins. The gross margin percentages for the Information Intelligence Group segment were 64.3%, 64.9% and 62.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The slight decrease in gross margin percentage in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to an increase in the mix of service revenue as a percentage of total revenue, slightly offset by an increase in service gross margins. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 related to an increase in the product margins due to a decrease in the royalties paid for third party software embedded into the products in 2010 compared to 2009. The gross margin percentages for the VMware Virtual Infrastructure segment were 85.8% in 2011, 85.1% in 2010 and 84.4% in 2009. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to improvements in license gross margins resulting from decreased software capitalization amortization expense. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to improved services margins. Research and Development As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were 10.7%, 11.1% and 11.6% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. R&D expenses increased $261.8 in 2011 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs, including stock based compensation, cost of facilities, depreciation expense and travel costs, partially offset by greater levels of software capitalization. Personnel related costs increased by $274.0, cost of facilities increased by $20.5, depreciation expense increased by $13.0 and travel costs increased by $10.0. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $73.6. R&D expenses increased $260.5 in 2010 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs, including stock based compensation, depreciation expense, cost of facilities and travel costs, partially offset by greater levels of software capitalization. Personnel related costs increased by $250.6, depreciation expense increased by $23.4, cost of facilities increased by $19.4 and travel costs increased by $9.4. Capitalized software development costs, which reduce R&D expense, increased by $62.2. Corporate reconciling items within R&D, which consist of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and transition costs increased $35.2 and $51.6 to $322.6 and $287.4 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Stock based compensation expense increased $40.5 and $44.2 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Acquisition related intangible asset amortization decreased $7.1 in 2011 and increased $10.7 in 2010 and transition costs increased $1.8 and decreased $3.3 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Intangible asset amortization increased in 2011 primarily due to the Isilon acquisition, which was consummated in the fourth quarter of 2010. Intangible asset amortization increased in 2010 primarily due to VMware acquisitions and to the Data Domain acquisition, which was consummated in the third quarter of 2009. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2011 was primarily due to options exchanged in the Isilon acquisition, which was consummated in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in stock based compensation expense in 2010 was attributable to the incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and the full year impact of options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. 29 Table of Contents R&D expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 7.6%, 7.9% and 8.5% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. R&D expenses increased $116.5 in 2011 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, including stock based compensation, cost of facilities, depreciation expense and travel costs. Personnel related costs increased by $124.8, cost of facilities increased by $4.2, depreciation expense increased by $17.8 and travel costs increased by $6.1. Partially offsetting these increased costs was an increase in capitalized software development costs of $60.4. R&D expenses increased $100.7 in 2010 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, depreciation expense, cost of facilities and travel costs. Personnel related costs increased by $122.4, depreciation expense increased by $14.7, cost of facilities increased by $14.3 and travel costs increased by $6.1. Partially offsetting these increased costs was an increase in capitalized software development costs of $70.1. R&D expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 15.6%, 16.8% and 18.3% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. R&D expenses increased $110.1 in 2011 largely due to increases in personnel related costs of $106.9. This increase was partially offset by increases in VMwares capitalized software development costs of approximately $13.3 in 2011, primarily due to the timing of products reaching technological feasibility. Following the release of vSphere 5 and the comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies in the third quarter of 2011, VMware determined that its go to market strategy had changed from single solutions to product suite solutions. As a result of this change in strategy, and the related increased importance of interoperability between VMwares products, the length of time between achieving technological feasibility and general release to customers significantly decreased. For future releases, VMware expects its products to be available for general release soon after technological feasibility has been established. Given that the majority of VMwares product offerings are expected to be suites or to have key components that interoperate with VMwares other product offerings, the costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are expected to be immaterial in future periods. R&D expenses increased $108.3 in 2010 largely due to increases in personnel related costs of $87.3, primarily due to increased salaries and benefits expenses resulting from incremental headcount from strategic hiring and acquisitions. Additionally, capitalized software development costs decreased $7.9 in 2010 primarily due to lower costs capitalized on products that build on the VMware vSphere foundation in 2010. Selling, General and Administrative As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 32.4%, 31.6% and 32.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. SG&A expenses increased by $1,104.1 in 2011 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, travel costs, commissions, cost of facilities and depreciation expense. Personnel related costs increased by $768.0, travel costs increased by $61.8, commissions increased by $51.9, cost of facilities increased by $43.8 and depreciation expense increased by $29.7 in 2011. SG&A expenses increased by $779.7 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, commissions, travel costs, business development costs, cost of facilities and depreciation expense. Personnel related costs increased by $439.4, commissions increased by $168.1, travel costs increased by $73.3, business development costs increased by $43.7, cost of facilities increased by $35.6 and depreciation expense increased by $28.5 in 2010. Corporate reconciling items within SG&A, which consist of stock based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization and transition costs increased $128.9 to $606.4 in 2011 and decreased $18.0 to $477.5 in 2010. Intangible asset amortization increased $38.2, stock based compensation expense increased $95.6 and transition costs decreased $4.9 in 2011. Intangible asset amortization increased primarily due to the Greenplum and Isilon acquisitions, which were consummated in the third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively. Stock based compensation expense increased in 2011 primarily due to the Isilon acquisition. In 2010, intangible asset amortization increased $26.8, stock based compensation expense increased $25.9 and transition costs decreased $13.2. Additionally, the provision for litigation of $57.5 in 2009 did not recur in 2010. Intangible asset amortization increased primarily due to VMware acquisitions and to the Data Domain acquisition, which was consummated in the third quarter of 2009. Stock based compensation expense increased in 2010 due to the incremental expense associated with VMwares equity grants and the full year impact of options exchanged in the acquisition of Data Domain. SG&A expenses within EMCs Information Infrastructure business, as a percentage of EMCs Information Infrastructure business revenues, were 27.0%, 26.4% and 27.1% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. SG&A expenses increased $655.1 in 2011 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, travel costs, commissions, cost of facilities and depreciation expense. Personnel related costs increased by $435.4, travel costs increased by $45.8, commissions increased by $28.7, cost of facilities increased by $21.2 and depreciation expense increased by $20.7 in 2011. SG&A expenses increased $479.0 in 2010 primarily due to increases in personnel related costs, commissions, travel costs, business development costs, cost of facilities and depreciation. Personnel related costs increased by $258.8, commissions increased by $108.4, travel costs increased by $52.0, business development costs increased by $35.3, cost of facilities increased by $21.1 and depreciation expense increased by $14.9. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in professional services costs of $12.3. 30 Table of Contents SG&A expenses within the VMware Virtual Infrastructure business, as a percentage of VMwares revenues, were 39.4%, 40.7% and 41.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. SG&A expenses increased $320.0 in 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2011 was primarily due to growth in personnel related expenses driven by incremental headcount and by higher commission expense due to increased sales volumes. SG&A expenses increased $318.7 in 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2010 was primarily the result of higher salaries and benefits costs resulting from incremental headcount from strategic hiring and acquisitions as well as commission expense on higher sales volumes. Also contributing to the change was increased spending on marketing programs. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Charges In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred restructuring and acquisition related charges of $97.3, $84.4 and $107.5, respectively. In 2011, we incurred $86.0 of restructuring charges, of which $63.2 primarily related to our current year restructuring programs and $11.3 of charges in connection with acquisitions for financial, advisory, legal and accounting services. In 2010, we incurred $76.7 of restructuring charges, of which $37.8 primarily related to our 2010 restructuring program and $7.7 of charges in connection with acquisitions for financial, advisory, legal and accounting services. In 2009, we incurred $88.4 of restructuring charges, of which $69.3 primarily related to our 2008 restructuring program and $19.1 of charges in connection with acquisitions for financial, advisory, legal and accounting services. During 2011, we implemented separate restructuring programs to create further operational efficiencies which will result in a workforce reduction of 787 positions and the vacation of certain facilities. These actions will impact positions around the globe covering our Information Storage, RSA Information Security and Information Intelligence Group segments. All of these actions will be completed by the end of 2012. During 2010, we implemented a restructuring program to create further operational efficiencies which resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 400 positions. These actions impacted positions around the globe covering our Information Storage, RSA Information Security and Information Intelligence Group segments. All of these actions have been completed by the end of 2011. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $26.1, $31.6 and $27.1, respectively, of lease termination costs for facilities vacated and other contractual obligations in the respective periods as part of all of our restructuring programs. These costs are expected to be utilized by the end of 2015. The remaining cash portion owed for these programs in 2012 is approximately $62.0, plus an additional $19.7 over the period from 2013 and beyond. Investment Income Investment income was $129.2, $142.5 and $140.4 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Investment income decreased in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains and lower coupon income. Net realized gains were $10.1, $15.8 and $20.8 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense was $170.5, $178.3 and $182.5 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on the $1,725 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes), and our $1,725 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes and, together with the 2011 Notes, the Notes) which we issued in November 2006. Included in interest expense are non cash interest charges related to amortization of the debt discount attributable to the conversion feature of $115.9, $114.5 and $108.3 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We are accreting our convertible debt to their stated values over their term. See Note E to the consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $(152.0), $(39.5) and $2.4 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Other expense in 2011 primarily consisted of our consolidated share of the losses from our converged infrastructure joint venture, VCE Company LLC, of $(209.2), partially offset by the non recurring gain on the sale of VMwares investment in Terremark Worldwide, Inc. in the second quarter of 2011 of $56.0. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. Other expense in 2010 was primarily attributable to our consolidated share of the losses from VCE Company LLC of $42.8. See Note J to the consolidated financial statements. Other income in 2009 was primarily attributable to gains on strategic investments. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 19.7%, 24.5% and 18.4% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies. Our aggregate income tax rate in foreign 31 Table of Contents jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the United States; substantially all of our income before provision for income taxes from foreign operations has been earned by our Irish subsidiaries. We do not believe that any recent or currently expected developments in non U.S. tax jurisdictions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our effective rate. Our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates. In 2011, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 14.4 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences, resolution of income tax audits and reversal of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations and other items collectively decreased the rate by 0.9 percentage points. In 2010, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 12.2 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. In 2010, we effected a plan to reorganize our international operations by transferring certain assets of Isilon, Archer Technologies and Bus Tech entities into a single EMC international holding company. As a result of this reorganization, we incurred an income tax charge which negatively impacted our effective tax rate by 3.2 percentage points. In 2010, we also had a reduction in our valuation allowance which arose from the utilization of a certain subsidiarys foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a benefit to our effective tax rate of 0.6 percentage points. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences, resolution of income tax audits and elimination of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations and other items collectively decreased the rate by 0.9 percentage points. In 2009, the lower aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions reduced our effective rate by 17.5 percentage points compared to our statutory federal tax rate of 35.0%. The resolution of income tax audits and reversal of reserves associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations for which we believe we had certain tax exposure favorably reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 4.5 percentage points. In 2009, we effected a plan to reorganize our international operations by transferring certain assets of our RSA and Data Domain entities and legacy foreign corporations owned directly by EMC into a single EMC international holding company. As a result of this reorganization, we incurred income taxes which negatively impacted our effective tax rate by 4.4 percentage points. The net effect of tax credits, state taxes, non deductible permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances and other items collectively increased the rate by 1.0 percentage point, driven principally by non deductible permanent differences. The effective tax rate decreased from 2010 to 2011 by 4.8%, from 24.5% to 19.7%. This decrease was principally attributable to a higher amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions during 2011, which was largely due to how certain expenses are allocated to our world wide subsidiaries. Additionally, the decrease was attributable to the reorganization of our international operations during 2010, and the favorable resolution of income tax audits during 2011, which was partially offset by a decrease in our U.S. tax credits and an increase in other differences. The effective tax rate increased from 2009 to 2010 by 6.1%, from 18.4% to 24.5%. This increase was principally attributable to a lower amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions during 2010 and the favorable resolution of income tax audits in 2009, which was partially offset by reductions in our non deductible permanent differences and the reorganization of our international operations. Non controlling Interest in VMware, Inc. The net income attributable to the non controlling interest in VMware was $147.5, $69.7 and $33.7 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increases were due to increases in VMwares net income and increases in the weighted average percentage ownership by the non controlling interest in VMware. VMwares reported net income was $723.9, $357.4 and $197.1 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The weighted average non controlling interest in VMware was approximately 20.4%, 19.5% and 17.0% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In the first quarter of 2010, we announced a stock purchase program of VMwares Class A common stock to maintain an approximately 80% majority ownership in VMware over the long term. As of December 31, 2011, we have purchased approximately 10.6 million shares for $799.2. Financial Condition Cash provided by operating activities was $5,668.8, $4,548.8 and $3,334.4 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash received from customers was $21,144.7, $17,585.4 and $14,647.7 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in cash received from customers from 2009 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2011 was attributable to an increase in sales volume and higher cash proceeds from the sale of multi year maintenance contracts, which are typically billed and paid in advance of services being rendered. Cash paid to suppliers and employees was $15,218.7, $12,830.7 and $11,032.9 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees from 2009 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to a general growth in the business to support the increased revenue base. Income taxes paid was $323.1, $232.1 and $316.5 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These payments are comprised of estimated taxes for the current year, extension payments for the prior year and refunds or payments associated with income tax filings and tax audits. 32 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities was $3,543.5, $6,476.0 and $3,095.5 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash used for business acquisitions, strategic and other related investments was $837.1, $3,070.7 and $2,827.9 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, we acquired seven companies for $536.6, net of cash acquired, and spent $300.5 on strategic and other related investments including the purchase of patents from Novell of $112.5, and VMware purchased a leasehold interest for $151.1. In 2010, we acquired Isilon for $2,301.1, net of cash acquired, and in 2009, we acquired Data Domain for $1,933.9, net of cash acquired. Additionally, we also provided funding of $383.2 to our joint venture, VCE Company LLC, in 2011 compared to $29.6 in 2010 and $19.2 in 2009. Capital additions were $801.4, $745.4 and $411.6 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher level of capital additions in both 2011 and 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in spending on facility expansion and information technology infrastructure for 2011 as well as to support the growth of the business. Capitalized software development costs were $442.3, $363.0 and $304.5 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily attributable to EMC Information Infrastructures software development activities. Net purchases of investments were $928.4 and $2,267.3 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to net sales and maturities of $466.6 in 2009. This activity varies from period to period based upon our cash collections, cash requirements and maturity dates of our investments. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1,718.5), $(243.8) and $211.9 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011 and 2010, we spent $2,000.0 and $999.9 to repurchase 81.8 million and 52.7 million shares of EMC common stock, respectively. Additionally, in 2011 and 2010 we spent $400.0 and $399.2 to purchase 4.6 million and 6.0 million shares of VMware common stock, respectively, and VMware spent $526.2 and $338.5 to repurchase 6.0 million and 4.9 million shares of its common stock, respectively. We made no share repurchases in 2009. We generated $1,011.0, $1,212.0 and $594.0 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares within the employee stock plans. We generated $361.6, $281.9 and $46.1 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. In 2011, we spent $141.0 on the settlement of interest rate contracts. We expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations and to use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2011, the 2011 Notes had matured and the note holders exercised their rights to convert the outstanding Notes. Due to the settlement terms, the majority of the converted Notes were not settled until January 9, 2012. At that time, we paid the note holders $1,699.8 in cash for the outstanding principal and 29.5 million shares for the $661.4 excess of the conversion value over the principal amount, as prescribed by the terms of the Notes. We intend to issue debt in 2012 to replace the 2011 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock (the Purchased Options). The Purchased Options allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the Notes upon conversion. The Purchased Options will cover, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of our common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we exercised 107.5 million of the Purchased Options in conjunction with the planned settlements of the 2011 Notes, and we received 29.5 million shares of net settlement on January 9, 2012, representing the excess conversion value of the options. The remaining 107.5 million of the Purchased Options expire on December 1, 2013. The remaining $1,725.0 of the 2013 Notes is due in November 2013. Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period during the three months ended December 31, 2011, the contingent conversion thresholds on the 2013 Notes were exceeded. As a result, the 2013 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder through March 31, 2012. Upon conversion, we are obligated to pay cash up to the principal amount of the debt converted. We have the option to settle any conversion value in excess of the principal amount with cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. Approximately $0.5 of the 2013 Notes have been converted as of December 31, 2011. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we also entered into separate transactions in which we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, shares of our common stock. Half of the associated warrants have expiration dates between February 15, 2012 and March 14, 2012 and the remaining half of the associated warrants have expiration dates between February 18, 2014 and March 18, 2014. Upon exercise, the value of the warrants is required to be settled in shares. See Note E to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we also have available for use a credit line of $50.0 in the United States. As of December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit. The credit line bears interest at the banks base rate and requires us, upon utilization of the credit line, to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses. In the event the covenants are not met, the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of liabilities of our subsidiaries was approximately $6,162.3. 33 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, our total cash, cash equivalents, and short term and long term investments were $10,843.1. This balance includes approximately $4,512.3 held by VMware, of which $2,072.2 is held overseas, and $1,517.0 held by EMC in overseas entities. If these overseas funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Results The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). EMC uses certain non GAAP financial measures, which exclude stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and acquisition related charges, infrequently occurring gains, losses and charges, and special tax items to measure its gross margin, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share for purposes of managing our business. EMC also assesses its financial performance by measuring its free cash flow which is also a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. These non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMCs financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMCs non GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non GAAP financial measures. EMCs management uses the non GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of EMCs comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes these items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segments financial goals. These non GAAP financial measures are used by EMCs management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect EMCs ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons. EMCs management believes that these non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMCs current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner EMCs current financial results with EMCs past financial results. Our non GAAP operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: For the Three Months Ended For the Year Ended December 31,2011 December 31,2010 December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Gross margin $ 3,595.8 $ 3,028.4 $ 12,516.1 $ 10,271.4 Gross margin percentage 64.5 % 61.9 % 62.6 % 60.4 % Operating income 1,467.8 1,243.0 4,784.0 3,738.0 Operating income percentage 26.3 % 25.4 % 23.9 % 22.0 % Income tax provision 253.4 249.8 949.3 824.0 Net income attributable to EMC 1,065.2 920.1 3,380.5 2,715.3 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.49 $ 0.42 $ 1.51 $ 1.26 The improvements in the non GAAP gross margin and non GAAP gross margin percentage were attributable to higher sales volume, a change in mix attributable to higher margin products and improved cost control. The improvements in the non GAAP operating income and non GAAP operating income percentage were primarily attributable to an improved gross margin percentage. 34 Table of Contents The reconciliation of the above financial measures from GAAP to non GAAP is as follows: For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 GAAP Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges RSA specialcharge Gain onstrategicinvestments Special taxcharge Non GAAP Gross margin $ 3,523.3 $ 31.7 $ 40.8 $ $ $ $ $ 3,595.8 Operating income 1,138.8 213.9 86.2 28.9 1,467.8 Income tax provision 174.9 47.6 27.3 3.7 253.4 Net income attributable to EMC 832.0 151.8 56.1 25.2 1,065.2 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.38 $ 0.07 $ 0.03 $ 0.01 $ $ $ $ 0.49 For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 GAAP Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges RSA specialcharge Gain onstrategicinvestments Special taxcharge Non GAAP Gross margin $ 2,966.3 $ 28.9 $ 33.2 $ $ $ $ $ 3,028.4 Operating income 943.7 185.4 70.4 43.5 1,243.0 Income tax provision 257.0 45.2 24.1 6.8 (83.3 ) 249.8 Net income attributable to EMC 628.6 126.9 44.6 36.7 83.3 920.1 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.29 $ 0.06 $ 0.02 $ 0.02 $ $ $ 0.04 $ 0.42 For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 GAAP Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges RSA specialcharge Gain onstrategicinvestments Special taxcharge Non GAAP Gross margin $ 12,168.9 $ 123.7 $ 157.2 $ $ 66.3 $ $ $ 12,516.1 Operating income 3,442.4 836.2 341.8 97.3 66.3 4,784.0 Income tax provision 640.4 194.6 107.9 15.9 10.1 (19.6 ) 949.3 Net income attributable to EMC 2,461.3 587.0 223.9 80.9 56.2 (28.9 ) 3,380.5 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 1.10 $ 0.26 $ 0.10 $ 0.04 $ 0.03 $ (0.01 ) $ $ 1.51 For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 GAAP Stock basedcompensation Intangibleassetamortization Restructuringandacquisition relatedcharges RSA specialcharge Gain onstrategicinvestments Special taxcharge Non GAAP Gross margin $ 10,031.0 $ 108.7 $ 131.8 $ $ $ $ $ 10,271.4 Operating income 2,683.3 685.1 285.3 84.4 3,738.0 Income tax provision 638.3 165.7 92.7 10.7 (83.3 ) 824.0 Net income attributable to EMC 1,900.0 472.7 187.3 72.0 83.3 2,715.3 Diluted earnings per share attributable to EMC $ 0.88 $ 0.22 $ 0.09 $ 0.03 $ $ $ 0.04 $ 1.26 We also monitor our ability to generate free cash flow in relationship to our non GAAP net income attributable to EMC over comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our free cash flow was $4,425.1, an increase of 28.6% compared to the free cash flow generated for the year ended December 31, 2010. The free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 exceeded our non GAAP net income attributable to EMC by $1,044.6. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statements of cash flows. 35 Table of Contents The reconciliation of the above free cash flow from GAAP to non GAAP is as follows: For the Three Months Ended For the Year Ended December 31,2011 December 31,2010 December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Cash Flow from Operations $ 2,184.2 $ 1,512.2 $ 5,668.8 $ 4,548.8 Capital Expenditures (200.2 ) (203.5 ) (801.4 ) (745.4 ) Capitalized Software Development Costs (100.3 ) (90.5 ) (442.3 ) (363.0 ) Free Cash Flow $ 1,883.8 $ 1,218.2 $ 4,425.1 $ 3,440.5 Free cash flow represents a non GAAP measure related to operating cash flows. In contrast, our GAAP measures of cash flow consist of three components. These are cash flows provided by operating activities of $5,668.8 and $4,548.8 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, cash used in investing activities of $3,543.5 and $6,476.0 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and net cash used in financing activities of $1,718.5 and $243.8 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. All of the foregoing non GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMCs operations or cash flows. Further, these non GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMCs financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investments The following table summarizes the composition of our investments at December 31, 2011: AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains Unrealized(Losses) AggregateFair Value U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,474.0 $ 12.4 $ (1.5 ) $ 2,485.0 U.S. corporate debt securities 1,400.4 10.0 (2.6 ) 1,407.8 High yield corporate debt securities 442.7 12.5 (7.7 ) 447.5 Asset backed securities 29.1 0.1 29.1 Municipal obligations 814.7 2.0 (0.6 ) 816.1 Auction rate securities 82.9 (8.3 ) 74.6 Foreign debt securities 984.7 5.2 (2.8 ) 987.1 Total fixed income securities 6,228.5 42.1 (23.5 ) 6,247.1 Publicly traded equity securities 58.2 6.8 65.0 Total $ 6,286.7 $ 49.0 $ (23.5 ) $ 6,312.1 Our fixed income and equity investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair market values. At December 31, 2011, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by third party pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our fixed income holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. For all of our securities where the amortized cost basis was greater than the fair value at December 31, 2011, we have concluded that currently we neither plan to sell the security nor is it more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. In making the determination as to whether the unrealized loss is other than temporary, we considered the length of time and extent the investment has been in an unrealized loss position, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the issuers credit rating, third party guarantees and the time to maturity. 36 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contractual Obligations We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years* 3 4 years** More than4 years Operating leases $ 1,501.0 $ 254.9 $ 514.7 $ 90.0 $ 641.4 Notes converted and payable 1,699.8 1,699.8 Convertible debt 1,724.5 1,724.5 Product warranty obligations 254.6 Other long term obligations, including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations and post retirement obligations 287.9 136.2 1.3 0.6 1.3 Purchase orders 2,349.8 2,341.0 8.8 Uncertain tax positions 196.8 Total $ 8,014.4 $ 6,156.4 $ 524.8 $ 90.6 $ 642.7 *Includes payments from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015. **Includes payments from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2011, we had $254.6 of product warranty obligations, $148.5 of long term post retirement obligations, $2,349.8 of purchase orders and $196.8 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations. The purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services. While the purchase orders are generally cancellable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service. Our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world. We believe leasing such space in most cases is more cost effective than purchasing real estate. The 2011 Notes have been fully converted, were settled in January 2012 and are included here and in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 under Notes Converted and Payable. The convertible debt pertains to the 2013 Notes. The holders of the 2013 Notes may convert their Notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding September 1, 2013 only under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the price per Note for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Notes. Additionally, the 2013 Notes will become convertible during the last three months prior to their maturity. Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period during the three months ended December 31, 2011, the contingent conversion threshold on the 2013 Notes was exceeded. As a result, the 2013 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder through March 31, 2012. Accordingly, since the terms of the Notes require the principal to be settled in cash, we reclassified from equity the portion of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature which had not yet been accreted to its face value and the Notes have been classified as a current liability. For the holders to be able to continue to convert the 2013 Notes, our closing stock price must exceed $20.90 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days of each future quarter. If this threshold is not met, the 2013 Notes will be reclassified to long term debt. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations EMCs subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions for such institutions to provide guarantees for rent, taxes, insurance, leases, performance bonds, bid bonds and customs duties aggregating $115.0 as of December 31, 2011. The guarantees vary in length of time. In connection with these arrangements, we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the 37 Table of Contents guarantees provided by these financial institutions. EMC and certain of its subsidiaries have also entered into arrangements with financial institutions in order to facilitate the management of currency risk. EMC has agreed to guarantee the obligations of its subsidiaries under these arrangements. We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, resellers, joint ventures, OEMs, systems integrators and distributors. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an EMC product infringes a patent and or copyright. Certain agreements in which we grant limited licenses to specific EMC trademarks require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that the use of the licensed trademark infringes a third party trademark. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to the loss or processing of data, to real or tangible personal property damage, personal injury or the acts or omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time, we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. We have also made certain guarantees for obligations of affiliated third parties. We have agreements with certain vendors, financial institutions, lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters, such as acts and omissions of EMC, its employees, agents or representatives. We have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an OEM. Under some of these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies. We have agreed to indemnify the directors, executive officers and certain other officers of EMC and our subsidiaries, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired companys by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons. In a substantial majority of instances, we have maintained the acquired companys directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. These indemnities vary in length of time. Based upon our historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2011, we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at December 31, 2011 is not material. Pension We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan) that was assumed as part of the Data General acquisition, which covers substantially all former Data General employees located in the United States. Certain of the former Data General foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. All of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services. The assets for these defined benefit plans are invested in common stocks and bonds. The market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value. The expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 6.75%. This rate represents the average of the expected long term rates of return weighted by the plans assets as of December 31, 2011. We continue to shift the asset allocation to lower the percentage of investments in equities and increase the percentage of investments in long duration fixed income securities. The continued changes could result in a reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets and increase future pension expense consistent with the sensitivity described below. As of December 31, 2011, the ten year historical rate of return on plan assets was 5.5% and the inception to date return on plan assets was 9.8%. In 2011 and 2010, we experienced an 8.9% and 12.6% gain on plan assets, respectively. Based upon current market conditions and the target allocation of the plans assets, the expected long term rate of return for 2012 is 6.75%. A 25 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a $1.0 impact on the 2012 pension expense. As of December 31, 2011, the Pension Plan had a $218.0 unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants of 13.10 years. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 4.6%. This rate represents the average of the discount rate weighted by the plans liabilities as of December 31, 2011. The discount rate selected was based on highly rated long term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plans benefit obligations. The bond indices and yield curve analyses include only bonds rated AA or higher from a reputable rating agency. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a $0.6 impact on the 2012 pension expense for all plans. Additionally, certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans. These foreign pension plans are excluded from this discussion because they do not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 38 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the areas set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented within Note A to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The application of the appropriate guidance within the Accounting Standards Codification to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes information systems, including hardware storage and hardware related devices, software, including required storage operating systems and optional value added software application programs, and services, including installation, professional, software and hardware maintenance and training, or a combination of these items. As our business evolves, the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized. Additionally, revenue recognition involves judgments, including estimates of fair value and selling price in arrangements with multiples deliverables, assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience and market and economic conditions. Changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized. Should market or economic conditions deteriorate, our actual return experience could exceed our estimate. Warranty Costs We accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment. We estimate systems warranty costs based upon historical experience, specific identification of system requirements and projected costs to service items under warranty. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs. To the extent that our actual systems warranty costs differed from our estimates by 5 percent, consolidated pre tax income would have increased/decreased by approximately $12.7 and $11.8 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Asset Valuation Asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts and notes receivable, investments, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate. The market value of our short and long term investments is based primarily upon the listed price of the security. At December 31, 2011, with the exception of our auction rate securities, the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs such as market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securitys market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Each month, we perform independent price verifications of all of our fixed income holdings. In the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. In the event the fair market values that we determine are not accurate or we are unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner, we may not realize the recorded value of our investments. We hold investments whose market values are below our cost. The determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held, market conditions, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers, the time to maturity, length of the impairment, magnitude of the impairment and ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired. The recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and our levels of inventory held, forecasted demand, pricing, competition and changes in technology. Should current market and economic conditions deteriorate, our actual recovery could be less than our estimate. 39 Table of Contents Other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, forecasted cash flows, changes in technology and customer demand. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, at least annually, in the fourth quarter of each year. Our assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which, for certain of our operating segments, is one step below our segment level. During 2011, we early adopted the new accounting guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary and, in doing so, we evaluated goodwill for certain reporting units in a qualitative manner and determined there was no impairment. For the reporting units that we evaluated using a quantitative model, there was sufficient market value above the carrying value of those reporting units so that we would not expect any near term changes in the operating results that would trigger an impairment. The determination of relevant comparable industry companies impacts our assessment of fair value. Should the operating performance of our reporting units change in comparison to these companies or should the valuation of these companies change, this could impact our assessment of the fair value of the reporting units. Our discounted cash flow analyses factor in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates. These estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity, factoring in customer demand, changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues. Additionally, these discounted cash flow analyses factor in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit. Restructuring Charges We recognized restructuring charges in 2011, 2010, 2009 and prior years. The restructuring charges include, among other items, estimated employee termination benefit costs, subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts. The amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors, including market conditions, negotiations with third parties and finalization of severance agreements with employees. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation For our share based payment awards, we make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options, including volatility, expected life and forfeiture rates. Additionally, for awards which are performance based, we make estimates as to the probability of the underlying performance being achieved. Changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the value and timing of stock based compensation expense recognized, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. To manage the volatility relating to foreign exchange risk, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk Management As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, will be reported in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are reflected on our balance sheet. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. We enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the Euro, the Japanese yen and the pound sterling. Additionally, we have exposure to emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In all cases, we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures. The success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. We have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 based on scenarios in which market spot rates are hypothetically changed in order to produce a potential net exposure loss. The hypothetical change is based on a 10 percent strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar, whereby all other variables are held constant. The analyses include all of our foreign currency contracts outstanding as of December 31 for each year, as well as the offsetting underlying exposures. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of $30.6, $3.6 and $1.2 at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt and equity securities of various types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in U.S. dollars. These securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at market value, with any unrealized gain or temporary non credit related loss recorded in other comprehensive loss. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We employ a Historical Value At Risk calculation to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios. This model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last 180 days are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day. This model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates, using a 95% confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. The value at risk on the debt portion of the investment portfolio was $4.0 as of December 31, 2011 and $3.6 as of December 31, 2010. The average, high and low value at risk amounts for 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Average High Low 2011 $ 4.0 $ 5.2 $ 3.1 2010 $ 3.6 $ 5.0 $ 3.0 The average value represents an average of the quarter end values. The high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of bank deposits, money market investments, short and long term investments, accounts and notes receivable, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Deposits held with banks in the United States may exceed the amount of FDIC insurance provided on such deposits. Deposits held 41 Table of Contents with banks outside the United States generally do not benefit from FDIC insurance. The majority of our day to day banking operations globally are maintained with Citibank. We believe that Citibanks position as a primary clearing bank, coupled with the substantial monitoring of their daily liquidity, both by their internal processes and by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, mitigate some of our risk. Our money market investments are placed with money market funds that are 2a 7 qualified. Rule 2a 7, adopted by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, establishes strict standards for quality, diversity and maturity, the objective of which is to maintain a constant net asset value of a dollar. We limit our investments in money market funds to those that are primarily associated with large, money center financial institutions. Our short and long term investments are invested primarily in investment grade securities, and we limit the amount of our investment in any single issuer. Due to the ongoing European Financial Crisis, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we took steps to limit certain exposure to investments in this region. We provide credit to customers in the normal course of business. Credit is extended to new customers based upon checks of credit references, credit scores and industry reputation. Credit is extended to existing customers based on prior payment history and demonstrated financial stability. The credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is generally limited due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas. We establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable. The allowance was $64.7 and $60.5 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity. Generally, we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes. Our sales are generally dispersed to a large number of customers, minimizing the reliance on any particular customer or group of customers. The counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions. In addition to limiting the amount of contracts we enter into with any one party, we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties on an ongoing basis. We purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose customer orders. We attempt to minimize this risk by finding alternative suppliers or maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet our forecasted needs. 42 Table of Contents
