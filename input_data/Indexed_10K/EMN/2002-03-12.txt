ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements for Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company"), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. All references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires its management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, impaired assets, restructuring of operations, investments, environmental costs, pensions and other postemployment benefits, goodwill and intangible assets, and litigation and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are the most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, price protection, promotions, and other volume based incentives. These estimates are based on a combination of forecast and actual sales volumes and revenues against established goals. If market conditions were to decline, the Company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings to maintain market share and capacity utilization. ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management continuously assesses the financial condition of the Companys customers and the markets in which these customers participate. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In response to the recent economic developments in Argentina, at December 31, 2001, management recorded an $18 million reserve for credit risks related to devaluation of the peso. A change in market conditions within Argentina could result in a significant increase or decrease in the reserve. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the United States by the last in, first out ("LIFO") method. The cost of all other inventories, including inventories outside the United States, is determined by the first in, first out ("FIFO") or average cost method. The Company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. IMPAIRED ASSETS The Company reviews the carrying values of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss for an asset to be held and used is recognized when the fair value of the asset is less than the 30 carrying value of the asset, and for assets to be disposed of, is recognized when the fair value of the asset, less costs to dispose, is less than the carrying value of the asset. The fair value of the assets is generally based on discounted estimated cash flows using annual discount rates of 7% to 9%. The estimates reflect the Companys assumptions about selling prices, production and sales volume levels, costs, and market conditions over the estimated remaining operating period which can range from three months to over fifteen years. If the Companys assumptions related to assets to be held and used are inaccurate, additional write downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related assets is adjusted, resulting in recognition of a credit or debit to earnings. RESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS The Company records restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations, exited business lines, or shutdowns of specific sites. These restructuring charges, which reflect managements commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months, are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, or other costs directly related to the restructuring. If the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost, an additional charge to earnings will result. If the actual cost is less than the estimated cost, a credit to earnings will be recognized. INVESTMENTS Marketable securities held by the Company, currently common or preferred stock, are deemed by management to be available for sale and are reported at fair value, with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities. The Company records an investment impairment charge when it believes a business venture investment, accounted for by the Company as a marketable security, has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Eastman has made a number of minority investments in technology businesses that the Company believes have potential to significantly impact the way business is conducted in the chemical industry. At December 31, 2001, the carrying value of the Companys investments in technology business ventures totaled approximately $30 million. Declines in the value of these or any other investment, or subsequent additional adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment, could result in impairment charges in the future. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS The Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount unless another amount within the range appears to be a better estimate. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remedial requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. PENSION AND OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS The Company maintains defined benefit plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increase for employees. Projected health care benefits additionally reflect the Companys assumptions about health care cost trends. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES Through December 31, 2001, the Company amortized certain intangible assets on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the underlying assets. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 31 ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", beginning January 1, 2002, the Company ceased amortization of purchased goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles. In the future, the Company will review the assets for impairment, and when required, the assets will be written down and charged to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value is more than the fair value. At December 31, 2001, the Company had net goodwill of $339 million and net other intangibles of $275 million. Management continues to assess the impact of SFAS No. 142 which could result in a material charge to earnings in 2002. The useful life of an intangible asset is based on the Companys assumptions regarding expected use of the asset; the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets; any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the assets legal or contractual life without substantial cost; the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors; and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the assets useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed, it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss. LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Companys operations from time to time are parties to, or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. NONRECURRING ITEMS It is the Companys policy to identify as a "nonrecurring item" a material charge or gain that is not associated with on going operations or that is caused by unique events not reflective of the Companys normal business activities in the period if such items individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on a specific line item in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) or have a material impact on results overall. The Company believes that separately reporting such charges or gains enhances transparency and comparability of results by removing distortion that would otherwise occur. Examples of such items that have been separately identified in the past under this policy include material charges or gains resulting from asset impairments and restructuring of operations, including employee terminations; litigation not related to on going operations; discontinued businesses; and acquisition charges including those related to acquired in process research and development. Nonrecurring items are appropriately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations as presented beginning on page 57 of this Form 10 K are discussed below. SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Sales revenue increased 2% including acquisitions but decreased 6% excluding acquisitions. The asset acquisition of the hydrocarbon resins and select portions of the rosin based resins businesses from Hercules Incorporated ("Hercules Businesses") and the acquisitions of McWhorter Technologies, Inc. ("McWhorter") and Chemicke Zavody Sokolov ("Sokolov"), primarily reflected in the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers, and Inks ("CASPI") segment, contributed 8% to the increase in sales revenue. Decreased sales volumes in existing businesses, attributed to weaker economic demand worldwide, had a negative impact on sales revenue of 5%. Foreign currency exchange rates had a 1% negative impact on sales revenue while overall selling prices remained flat compared to 2000. Operating earnings for 2001 and 2000 were impacted by nonrecurring items totaling approximately $446 million and $21 million, respectively. These nonrecurring items are more fully described below and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2001, the decrease in operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items was due to lower sales volumes excluding acquisitions, higher unit costs driven by lower capacity utilization, and additional selling and general administrative 32 expenses and research and development costs from acquisitions. The decline in sales volumes in existing businesses was attributed to weaker economic demand worldwide. For 2001, the Company reported a loss of $2.33 per share compared with $3.94 earnings per share for 2000. Excluding the effect of nonrecurring items, earnings per share were $1.43 in 2001 compared to $3.88 in 2000. (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE SALES $5,384 $5,292 2% Revenue from acquisitions contributed 8% to the increase in sales revenue, partially offset by decreased sales volumes in existing businesses, which had a negative impact of 5% on sales revenue. The decline in sales volumes in existing businesses was attributed to weaker economic demand worldwide. Foreign currency exchange rates had a 1% negative impact on sales revenue. Overall, selling prices remained flat compared to 2000. (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE GROSS PROFIT $ 887 $1,078 (18)% As a percentage of sales 16.5% 20.4% In 2001, gross profit was negatively impacted by lower sales volumes in existing businesses attributed to weaker economic demand worldwide. Higher unit costs driven by lower capacity utilization also had a negative impact on gross profit. (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE SELLING AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ 407 $ 346 18% As a percentage of sales 7.6% 6.5% Higher selling and general administrative expenses primarily reflected additional costs associated with recent acquisitions, including integration costs, and costs incurred by Cendian Corporation ("Cendian") to develop its capacity to establish new customers in the chemicals logistics business. (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS $ 160 $ 149 7% As a percentage of sales 3.0% 2.8% Research and development costs increased for 2001 compared to 2000 mainly due to costs associated with the Hercules Businesses and McWhorter. ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES In 2001, nonrecurring charges totaling $396 million related to asset impairments and restructuring costs were recognized. 33 (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 Termination of raw material supply agreement $ 108 $ Under performing polyethylene assets 103 Consolidation and restructuring of CASPI operations 77 Restructuring of fine chemicals product lines 70 Under utilized specialty plastics assets 15 Discontinuation of precolored green PET 10 Cessation of production at solid stating facility 10 Impaired PCI European assets 3 Sorbates manufacturing exit costs 8 Distillation Products Industries exit costs 5 $ 396 $ 13 In 2001, approximately $231 million of asset impairment and restructuring charges were incurred in the Polymers segment. A charge of $108 million was recognized for the write off of a prepaid asset related to the termination of a raw material supply agreement and a charge of $103 million was recognized for the write down of underperforming polyethylene assets. A $10 million charge related to discontinuation of the precolored green polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") product line in Kingsport, Tennessee and a $10 million charge related to cessation of production at the Companys solid stating facility in Toronto, Ontario were also recognized. The consolidation and restructuring of the operations of the CASPI segment resulted in restructuring charges, including related asset write downs, totaling $77 million. Of these charges, $27 million related to the closure of an operating site in Dusseldorf, Germany that was obtained in the acquisition of Jager and $21 million related to the closure of a Moundville, Alabama plant that was obtained in the acquisition of Lawter International, Inc. ("Lawter"). The closure of plants in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Portland, Oregon that were obtained in the acquisition of McWhorter resulted in charges of $20 million being recognized. These restructuring charges included write downs of the fixed assets at these facilities, severance accruals for employees impacted by the plant shutdowns, and other costs associated with closing the facilities. Charges of $6 million and $3 million were recorded for the write down of impaired operating assets in North America and Europe, respectively. The Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment incurred total nonrecurring charges of $73 million in 2001. Approximately $70 million of these charges resulted from the Companys on going restructuring of its fine chemicals product line to reduce costs and to write down assets determined to be impaired. The restructuring initiative and related asset impairments include assets at the Companys Tennessee and Arkansas sites within the United States, a plant in Wales, and a plant in Hong Kong. A charge of $63 million pertained primarily to write downs of fixed assets associated with product lines that the Company will no longer pursue, net of the effect of a reversal of a customer deposit related to the impacted assets, and write downs of other long term deposits. A charge of $7 million pertained primarily to severance accruals for employees impacted by the plant shutdowns, closure costs, and write downs of fixed assets. An additional charge of $3 million was recognized for impaired assets in the European region. The Company recorded asset impairment charges of approximately $15 million associated with under utilized assets in the Specialty Plastics ("SP") segment. These charges related to deterioration of demand for certain specialty plastics products produced in Kingsport, Tennessee. Approximately $75 million of the charges discussed above were recognized in the fourth quarter 2001. Of this total, $36 million related to the consolidation and restructuring of the operations of the CASPI segment; $20 million related to asset impairment charges associated with under utilized assets in the Polymers segment; $15 million related to under utilized specialty plastics assets; $3 million related to impaired PCI European assets; and $1 million related to the Companys on going restructuring of its fine chemicals product line. In 2000, nonrecurring charges totaling $13 million were recognized, of which $8 million related to costs associated with exiting the sorbates manufacturing site at Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and $5 million related to the shutdown of facilities at Distillation Products Industries in Rochester, New York. These charges are reflected in the PCI segment. For additional information regarding these asset impairments and restructuring costs, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 34 (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 OTHER NONRECURRING OPERATING ITEMS Costs associated with efforts to spin off specialty chemicals and plastics businesses $ 20 $ Write down of accounts receivable resulting from economic crisis in Argentina 18 Pension settlement charge 7 Write off of Hercules Businesses in process research and development costs 5 Write off of McWhorter in process research and development costs 9 Gain on sale of assets (1) $ 50 $ 8 Other nonrecurring operating items totaling $50 million were recognized in 2001. These items consisted of approximately $20 million in charges associated with efforts to spin off the specialty chemicals and plastics businesses; an $18 million write down of accounts receivable for credit risks resulting from the economic crisis in Argentina; a $7 million pension settlement charge; and a $5 million write off of acquired in process research and development costs related to the acquisition of the Hercules Businesses. Approximately $26 million of these items were reflected in the Polymers segment, $11 million in the CASPI segment, $7 million in the PCI segment, $4 million in the SP segment, and $2 million in the Fibers segment. Total charges recognized during the fourth quarter 2001 were $36 million. Other nonrecurring operating items totaling approximately $8 million were recorded in 2000. Reflected in the CASPI segment was a $9 million charge for costs associated with the write off of in process research and development related to the McWhorter acquisition, partially offset by a $1 million gain on the sale of certain assets, reflected in the Polymers segment. (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE GROSS INTEREST COSTS $ 151 $ 148 LESS CAPITALIZED INTEREST 5 6 INTEREST EXPENSE 146 142 3% INTEREST INCOME 6 7 NET INTEREST EXPENSE $ 140 $ 135 4% Higher interest expense reflected higher average commercial paper and other short term borrowings used to finance the purchase of recent acquisitions and for general financing and investing activities, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates of approximately 6.5% for 2001 compared to approximately 7.25% for 2000. (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE OTHER INCOME $ (11) $ (31) (65)% OTHER CHARGES 22 34 (35)% GAIN RECOGNIZED ON INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF GENENCOR (38) N/A Included in other income are gains from equity investments, gains on sales of nonoperating assets, royalty income, gains on foreign exchange transactions, and other miscellaneous items. Other income for 2001 primarily reflected gains from equity investments. Other income for 2000 primarily reflected gains on sales of nonoperating assets and gains from equity investments. Included in other charges are losses from foreign exchange transactions, certain litigation costs, losses from equity investments, losses on sales of nonoperating assets, fees on securitized receivables, and other miscellaneous items. Other charges declined mainly due to a decrease in certain litigation costs and lower fees related to securitized receivables. In 2000, a nonrecurring gain of approximately $38 million resulted from the initial public offering of common shares of Genencor International, Inc. ("Genencor"). This transaction is more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 35 (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 OTHER NONRECURRING ITEMS $ 20 $ 10 Other nonrecurring items for 2001 totaling $20 million consisted of a $12 million charge for currency losses resulting from the economic crisis in Argentina and $8 million of sorbates civil litigation settlement costs and other professional fees. Other nonrecurring items for 2000 totaling $10 million were recognized for costs related to sorbates civil litigation. SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are managed and reported in five operating segments. The Chemicals Group includes the CASPI segment, the PCI segment, and the SP segment. The Polymers Group includes the Polymers segment and the Fibers segment. During the first quarter 2002, the Company began managing the Chemicals Group as Eastman Division and the Polymers Group as Voridian Division ("Voridian"). CHEMICALS GROUP CASPI SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE Sales $1,508 $1,176 28 % Operating earnings (loss) including nonrecurring items (35) 123 (128)% Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 53 132 (60)% 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Sales revenue from acquisitions had a positive impact on sales revenue of 35%, which was partially offset by a 7% decrease in sales volumes for existing businesses. The decline in sales volumes for existing businesses was attributed to weaker economic demand worldwide. Increased selling prices had a 1% positive impact on sales revenue, offset by the negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Operating results for 2001 and 2000 were negatively impacted by nonrecurring items of approximately $88 million and $9 million, respectively, as more fully described above and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The decrease in operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items was due to lower sales volumes excluding acquisitions, higher unit costs driven by lower capacity utilization and additional selling and general administrative expenses and research and development costs from acquisitions. PCI SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE Sales $1,132 $1,297 (13)% Operating earnings (loss) including nonrecurring items (76) 87 (187)% Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 4 100 (96)% 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Sales revenue declined 10% due to lower sales volumes attributed to weaker economic demand worldwide. Other factors which negatively impacted sales revenue for 2001 by 1% each included a decline in selling prices, the negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates, and product mix. 36 Results for 2001 and 2000 were impacted by nonrecurring items of approximately $80 million and $13 million, respectively, as more fully described above and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The decrease in operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items was mainly due to higher unit costs driven by lower capacity utilization and decreased sales volumes resulting from weaker economic demand worldwide. In addition, lower selling prices had an $11 million negative impact on results for 2001 when compared to 2000. Based upon indications from a large customer of this segment that it does not intend to renew its contract for a custom synthesis product beyond 2002, the Company does not expect to pursue that product in the future. Sales of that product represented approximately 2% of Eastmans sales for 2000 and approximately 5% of Eastmans operating earnings for 2000. Financial results reported after June 30, 2001 reflect a minimal contribution to operating earnings from this contract. SP SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE Sales $ 505 $ 550 (8)% Operating earnings including nonrecurring items 40 103 (61)% Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 59 103 (43)% 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Sales revenue declined mainly due to lower sales volumes which had a negative impact on sales revenue of 7%. Foreign currency exchange rates had a 1% negative effect on sales revenue while selling prices remained relatively flat compared to 2000. Results for 2001 were negatively impacted by nonrecurring items totaling approximately $19 million, as more fully described above and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The decrease in operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items was primarily due to higher unit costs driven by lower capacity utilization and decreased sales volumes resulting from weaker demand, primarily for cellulosic products. POLYMERS GROUP POLYMERS SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE Sales $1,611 $1,636 (2)% Operating earnings (loss) including nonrecurring items (201) 99 (303)% Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 56 98 (43)% 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Decreased selling prices for polyethylene had a negative impact of 3% on sales revenue, partially offset by a 2% increase in sales volumes for PET polymers. Foreign currency exchange rates had a 2% negative impact on sales revenue. Results for 2001 were sharply impacted by nonrecurring items totaling approximately $257 million, while results for 2000 were positively impacted by a $1 million gain on the sale of certain assets. These items are more fully described above and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The decrease in operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items was primarily due to lower operating earnings for polyethylene, which was attributed to lower selling prices. Operating earnings and revenues for PET polymers excluding nonrecurring items were virtually flat when compared to 2000. 37 FIBERS SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE Sales $ 628 $ 633 (1)% Operating earnings including nonrecurring items 146 150 (3)% Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 148 150 (1)% 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Decreased sales volumes had a negative impact on sales revenue of 2%. The sales volume decrease was offset by increased selling prices, primarily related to acetate tow. Foreign currency exchange rates had a 1% negative effect on sales revenue. Operating earnings were impacted by nonrecurring items of approximately $2 million, as more fully described above and in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items remained flat in 2001 as a slight decline in sales volumes was offset by a slight increase in selling prices. For supplemental analysis of segment results and the impact of recent acquisitions on revenue, see Exhibits 99.01 and 99.02 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K. For additional information concerning the Companys operating segments, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 CHANGE United States and Canada $3,196 $3,229 (1)% Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,148 1,062 8 % Asia Pacific 555 547 1 % Latin America 485 454 7 % $5,384 $5,292 In the United States and Canada, sales revenue decreased slightly mainly due to lower sales volumes for existing businesses, attributed to weaker economic demand, which had a negative impact of 8% on sales revenue. Lower selling prices, primarily for polyethylene, also had a negative impact on sales revenue of 2%. These decreases were partially offset by revenue contributed by acquisitions, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 9%. Sales revenue outside the United States and Canada increased 6% to $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2000. Increased sales volumes resulting from acquisitions and increased selling prices, mainly for PET polymers, had a positive impact on sales revenue of 6% and 2%, respectively. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates which had a negative impact on sales revenue of 3%. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, sales revenue increased mainly due to revenue contributed by acquisitions, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 11%. Increased selling prices had a positive impact on sales revenue of 5%, offset by decreased sales volumes for existing businesses. PET polymers were the primary reason for the change in selling prices and sales volumes. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of 3% on sales revenue. The slight increase in sales revenue in Asia Pacific was due to higher sales volumes, mainly for PET polymers, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 7%. This increase was partially offset by lower selling prices and foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact on sales revenue of 4% and 2%, respectively. In Latin America, sales revenue increased primarily due to increased sales volumes, mainly for PET polymers, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 7%. Higher selling prices had a positive impact on sales revenue of 2%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. 38 With a substantial portion of 2001 sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and Part II Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 Eastmans record sales revenue of $5.3 billion represented an increase of 15% over 1999 sales revenue. Higher selling prices accounted for 11% of the increase in sales revenue and improved sales volumes had a positive impact of 8% on sales revenue. The increase in selling prices was driven by substantially higher selling prices for PET polymers and higher selling prices in the PCI and CASPI segments. Significant sales volume growth in the CASPI segment, mainly attributable to acquisitions, accounted for the increase in sales volumes. Substantially higher operating earnings reflected improving market conditions for PET polymers, growth through acquisitions, and an on going emphasis on lower cost structure. Operating earnings for 2000 and 1999 were negatively impacted by nonrecurring items totaling approximately $21 million and $117 million, respectively, as more fully described below and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2000, significant factors that impacted operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items included the improving supply and demand balance for PET polymers accompanied by the Companys firm stance on pricing for PET polymers, lower cost structure resulting from employee separations that occurred late in 1999 and additional non labor cost reductions implemented in 2000, and overall higher selling prices. Lower pension expense of approximately $30 million resulted from mid 1999 amendments to the Companys defined benefit pension plan. Costs for major raw materials and energy were approximately $380 million higher, net of the Companys feedstock and energy cost hedging program. Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items for 1999 were negatively impacted by charges totaling approximately $17 million related to the write up of Lawters inventory required by purchase accounting; a decrement recognized using the last in, first out inventory valuation method; loss on sales of excess spare parts; and two months of unplanned downtime at the Companys Malaysia facility. Amendments to Eastmans defined benefit pension plan resulted in a decrease in pension expense for 1999 of approximately $37 million. As a result of the adoption of AICPA Statement of Position 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use", Eastman capitalized $24 million, of which $2 million was amortized, of certain internal use software costs which otherwise would have been expensed. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE SALES $5,292 $4,590 15% The increase in sales revenue is mainly due to higher selling prices for PET polymers and higher selling prices in the PCI and CASPI segments, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 11%. Increased sales volumes had a positive impact of 8% on sales revenue. Significant sales volume growth in the CASPI segment, mainly attributable to acquisitions, accounted for the increase in sales volumes. Overall, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on sales revenue of 3%, although the impact in Europe, Middle East and Africa was more significant due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Acquisitions contributed approximately $360 million to the increase in sales revenue. While sales volumes including acquisitions were up, volume in existing businesses declined 1% due to a slowing of economic demand in the second half of 2000, the Companys firm stance on pricing for PET polymers, and the discontinuation of certain products. 39 (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE GROSS PROFIT $1,078 $ 861 25% As a percentage of sales 20.4% 18.8% Gross profit improved substantially as a result of higher selling prices that were driven by increased raw materials costs, the Companys lower cost structure resulting from voluntary and involuntary employee separations that occurred late in 1999, and additional cost reductions implemented in 2000. Significantly higher costs for raw materials and energy negatively impacted gross profit, even with the Companys hedging of certain feedstock and energy costs. For the year, raw materials and energy costs were up approximately $380 million. Lower pension expense of approximately $30 million in 2000 resulted from mid 1999 amendments to the Companys defined benefit plan. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE SELLING AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ 346 $ 355 (3)% As a percentage of sales 6.5% 7.7% Benefits derived from a lower cost structure resulted in significantly lower selling and general administrative expenses, even with the addition of costs for acquired businesses and costs related to Cendian. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS $ 149 $ 187 (20)% As a percentage of sales 2.8% 4.1% Research and development costs were significantly lower during 2000 due to lower cost structure, although costs from acquired companies partially offset this decrease. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES $ 13 $ 52 In 2000, nonrecurring charges of $13 million were recognized, of which, $8 million related to costs associated with exiting the sorbates manufacturing site at Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and $5 million related to the shutdown of facilities at Distillation Products Industries in Rochester, New York. These charges are reflected in the PCI segment. In 1999, nonrecurring charges totaling $36 million related to asset impairments and restructuring of operations were recorded in the PCI segment. A charge of approximately $17 million was recognized in association with a decision to discontinue production at the Companys sorbates facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, which resulted in a write down of plant and equipment used at the site. A charge of approximately $9 million was recognized in relation to the phase out of operations at Distillation Products Industries in Rochester, New York, including costs associated with employee termination benefits and the write down of plant and equipment used at the site. A charge of approximately $10 million was recognized for the write off of construction in progress related to an epoxybutene ("EpB(R)") plant project that was terminated and determined to have no future value. Also in 1999, a charge of approximately $16 million, reflected in the Polymers segment, was recognized for the write off of construction in progress associated with a purified terephthalic acid ("PTA") plant project in Columbia, South Carolina. This project was terminated due to unfavorable market conditions and unsuccessful discussions with several potential buyers of this product. These nonrecurring charges are described in more detail in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 OTHER NONRECURRING OPERATING ITEMS $ 8 $ 65 40 Other nonrecurring operating items totaling $8 million were recorded in 2000. Reflected in the CASPI segment was a $9 million charge for costs associated with the write off of in process research and development related to the McWhorter acquisition, partially offset by a $1 million gain on the sale of certain assets, reflected in the Polymers segment. In 1999, other nonrecurring operating items totaling $65 million were recognized. Of these items, approximately $53 million related to employee separation and pension settlement charges and $25 million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development costs associated with the acquisition of Lawter. Nonrecurring operating items totaling approximately $8 million were recorded related to an increase in the reserve for sorbates civil litigation and other matters, a loss recognized on an investment, the write off of purchased technology which was determined to have no future value, and other items. A gain of approximately $21 million, reflected in the PCI segment, was recognized as a result of the reimbursement of previously expensed pension costs related to Holston Defense Corporation. These items are reflected in the Companys segments as follows: CASPI $30 million, SP $10 million, Polymers $21 million, Fibers $8 million, and PCI ($4) million. These other nonrecurring operating items are described in more detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE GROSS INTEREST COSTS $ 148 $ 139 LESS CAPITALIZED INTEREST 6 13 INTEREST EXPENSE 142 126 13% INTEREST INCOME 7 5 NET INTEREST EXPENSE $ 135 $ 121 12% Higher net interest expense reflects decreased capitalized interest resulting from the completion of certain capital expansion projects during 1999, higher average commercial paper borrowings due to acquisitions, and higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE OTHER INCOME $ (31) $ (12) 158% OTHER CHARGES 34 29 17% GAIN RECOGNIZED ON INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF GENENCOR (38) N/A Included in other income are gains from equity investments, gains on sales of nonoperating assets, royalty income, gains on foreign exchange transactions, and other miscellaneous items. Other income increased mainly due to higher income from equity investments and gains on sales of nonoperating assets. Included in other charges are losses from foreign exchange transactions, certain litigation costs, losses from equity investments, losses on sales of nonoperating assets, fees on securitized receivables, and other miscellaneous items. Other charges increased mainly due to an increase in certain litigation costs and higher fees related to securitized receivables. In 2000, a nonrecurring gain of approximately $38 million resulted from the initial public offering of common shares of Genencor. This transaction is more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 OTHER NONRECURRING ITEMS $ 10 $ (8) Other nonrecurring items for 2000 totaling $10 million were recognized for costs related to sorbates civil litigation. Other nonrecurring items for 1999 reflected a gain of $8 million from the sale of certain nonoperating assets. 41 SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT CHEMICALS GROUP CASPI SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE Sales $1,176 $ 836 41 % Operating earnings including nonrecurring items 123 121 2 % Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 132 151 (13)% 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 Sales revenue for the CASPI segment increased 41%, reflecting higher sales volumes attributable to the Lawter, Sokolov, and McWhorter acquisitions, and overall higher selling prices. Sales revenue increased 40% due to increased sales volumes and 6% due to higher selling prices. Foreign currency exchange rates and product mix had a negative impact on sales revenue of 4% and 1%, respectively. Results for 2000 and 1999 were negatively impacted by nonrecurring items totaling $9 million and $30 million, respectively, as more fully described above and in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2000, raw materials cost increases exceeded selling price increases, and margins eroded for many products. Lower cost structure resulting from employee separations that occurred late in 1999 and non labor cost reductions implemented in 2000 did not offset the reduction in margins. Operating earnings were positively affected by decreased pension expense in 2000 and 1999 that resulted from the mid 1999 amendments to Eastmans defined benefit pension plan. PCI SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE Sales $1,297 $1,245 4 % Operating earnings (loss) including nonrecurring items 87 (2) N/A Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 100 30 233 % 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 Sales revenue for the PCI segment increased 4% due to moderately higher selling prices. Increased selling prices, driven by higher raw materials costs, had a positive impact on sales revenue of 7%. Sales revenue for fine chemicals declined, partially due to lower volume associated with discontinued products that were part of the fine chemicals product line. Decreased sales volumes, foreign currency exchange rates, and product mix had a negative impact on sales revenue of 1% each. Operating earnings for 2000 were negatively impacted by nonrecurring items totaling approximately $13 million, as more fully described above and in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The operating loss for 1999 included nonrecurring items totaling approximately $32 million as more fully described above and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2000, operating earnings were positively impacted by lower cost structure, in part due to dependence on coal rather than oil or natural gas for acetyl based products, and higher selling prices. Decreased pension expense in 2000 and 1999 that resulted from the mid 1999 amendments to Eastmans defined benefit pension plan also had a positive impact on results. 42 SP SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE Sales $ 550 $ 531 4% Operating earnings including nonrecurring items 103 80 29% Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 103 90 14% 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 Sales revenue for the SP segment increased 4% as higher sales volumes and increased selling prices had a positive impact on revenues of 6% and 2%, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the effects of foreign currency exchange rates and product mix which negatively impacted sales revenue by 3% and 1%, respectively. Operating earnings for 1999 included other nonrecurring operating items totaling approximately $10 million, as more fully described above and in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. For 2000, operating earnings were positively impacted by lower cost structure and by decreased pension expense in 2000 and 1999 resulting from the mid 1999 amendments to Eastmans defined benefit pension plan. POLYMERS GROUP POLYMERS SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE Sales $1,636 $1,344 22 % Operating earnings (loss) including nonrecurring items 99 (104) N/A Operating earnings (loss) excluding nonrecurring items 98 (67) N/A 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 Sales revenue for the Polymers segment increased 22% due to higher selling prices which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 26%. The increase in selling prices was attributable to higher selling prices for PET polymers, driven by an improved supply and demand balance. Sales volumes for PET polymers used in beverage containers were level due to the Companys firm stance on selling prices and a maturing carbonated soft drink market in North America. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on sales revenue of 4%, although the impact in Europe was more significant due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Operating earnings for 2000 were positively impacted by a nonrecurring gain of $1 million related to the sale of certain assets. Operating earnings for 1999 were negatively impacted by nonrecurring charges totaling approximately $37 million, as more fully described above and in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating earnings were sharply higher for the year primarily due to the Companys lower cost structure and substantially higher selling prices for PET polymers. Margins on polyethylene products were pressured by higher raw material costs and lower selling prices that resulted from slowing demand. The Polymers segments operating earnings were positively affected by decreased pension expense in 2000 and 1999 resulting from the mid 1999 amendments to the Companys defined benefit pension plan. FIBERS SEGMENT (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE Sales $ 633 $ 634 0 % Operating earnings including nonrecurring items 150 107 40 % Operating earnings excluding nonrecurring items 150 115 30 % 43 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 Sales revenue for the Fibers segment was level. Higher sales volumes, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 3%, were offset by the impact of lower selling prices and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Operating earnings for 1999 were negatively impacted by nonrecurring items totaling $8 million, as more fully described above and in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating earnings increased sharply for the year primarily due to lower cost structure and by decreased pension expense in 2000 and 1999 resulting from mid 1999 amendments to the Companys defined benefit pension plan. SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 (Dollars in millions) 2000 1999 CHANGE United States and Canada $3,229 $2,869 13% Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,062 849 25% Asia Pacific 547 486 13% Latin America 454 386 18% $5,292 $4,590 Sales revenue in the United States and Canada for 2000 was $3.2 billion, up 13% from 1999 sales revenue of $2.9 billion. The improvement was primarily attributable to higher selling prices, mainly for PET polymers, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 8%. Increased sales volumes resulting from acquisitions had a positive impact on revenues of 5%. Sales revenue outside the United States and Canada increased 20% to $2.1 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in 1999. Higher selling prices, mainly for PET polymers, had a positive impact on sales revenue of 15%. Increased sales volumes resulting from acquisitions had a positive impact on revenues of 13%. These increases were partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange rates and product mix, which had a negative impact on revenues of 7% and 1%, respectively. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, sales revenue increased 25% in 2000 compared with 1999. Increased selling prices, primarily for PET polymers, had a positive impact on revenues of 22%. Higher sales volumes resulting from acquisitions had a positive impact on sales revenue of 19%. A strong U.S. dollar against the euro resulted in a significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of 15%. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased 13%, mainly due to increased sales volumes, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of 11%. The increase in sales volumes was driven by higher volumes for fibers. Other factors which positively impacted sales revenue included higher selling prices for performance chemicals and intermediates and PET polymers, which resulted in a positive impact on revenues of 3%, and foreign currency exchange rates, which had a 1% positive impact on revenues. Product mix had a negative impact of 2% on sales revenue in 2000. Sales revenue in Latin America increased 18%, mainly due to higher selling prices, primarily for PET polymers, which had a positive impact on revenues of 16%. Increased sales volumes had a positive impact on revenues of 2%. 44 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 431 $ 831 $ 744 Investing activities (523) (465) (715) Financing activities 57 (451) 128 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (35) $ (85) $ 157 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 66 $ 101 $ 186 Cash provided by operating activities for 2001 reflected an increase in working capital related to a decrease in trade accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in receivables, and additionally reflected the payment of certain employee incentive compensation expenses. In 2000, cash flows from operations were positively impacted by settlement of strategic foreign currency hedging transactions, partially offset by an increase in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities in 2000 and 1999 also reflected $50 million and $150 million, respectively, provided by a continuous sale of accounts receivable program. Cash used in investing activities in 2001 and 2000 reflected decreased expenditures for capital additions and acquisitions compared to 1999. In 2001, cash paid for the Hercules Businesses was approximately $252 million; in 2000, cash paid for McWhorter was approximately $200 million and for Sokolov was approximately $46 million; and in 1999, cash paid for Lawter was approximately $370 million. Cash used in investing activities in 2001, 2000, and 1999 additionally reflects other small acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities in 2000 reflected higher proceeds from sales of assets. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 reflected an increase in commercial paper and other short term borrowings to fund the acquisition of the Hercules Businesses and for general operating purposes. In 2000, cash used in financing activities reflected a repayment of borrowings associated with acquisitions. In 1999, cash provided by financing activities reflected an increase in borrowings primarily related to funding the Lawter acquisition and additional borrowings at year end as a precautionary measure related to the Year 2000 issue. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities in 2001 included the effect of an increase in treasury stock resulting from a reverse/forward stock split of the Companys common stock approved by the stockholders on May 3, 2001 and the repurchase of shares of the Companys common stock in 2000 and 1999. The Company expects to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. Priorities for use of available excess cash are to reduce outstanding borrowings, fund targeted growth initiatives such as small acquisitions and other ventures, and repurchase shares. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures were $234 million, $226 million, and $292 million for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. For 2002, the Company estimates that capital spending and other directed investments for small acquisitions and other ventures will be no more than expected depreciation and amortization of $370 million. Long term commitments related to planned capital expenditures are not material. 45 OTHER COMMITMENTS At December 31, 2001, the Companys obligations related to long term notes and debentures totaled $1.5 billion to be paid over a period extending 25 years. Other borrowings, related primarily to Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings, totaled approximately $700 million. The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2001, totaling approximately $1.9 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month to month operating leases totaling $239 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 40% relates to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 35% relates to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; and approximately 25% relates to railcars. The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD More Than Total 1 Year 2 5 Years 6 10 Years 10 Years Long term notes and debentures $ 1,493 $ $ 500 $ $ 993 Credit facility, commercial paper, and other borrowings 704 54 650 Purchase obligations 1,861 230 806 524 301 Operating leases 239 55 95 50 39 $ 4,297 $ 339 $ 2,051 $ 574 $ 1,333 If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. The Company maintains defined benefit plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Benefits are paid to employees from trust funds. The Company contributes to the plans as permitted by laws and regulations. No contribution to the plans was required in 2001 and the Company anticipates that none will be required in 2002. As disclosed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2001 the Company increased its minimum pension liability from $16 million to $187 million in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. While this amount does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication the Company will be required to contribute cash to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. For example, a 1% change in interest rates could impact future funding requirements by approximately $50 million. The Company has long term commitments relating to a joint venture as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company guarantees up to $125 million of the principal amount of the joint ventures third party borrowings, but believes, based on current facts and circumstances and the structure of the venture, that the likelihood of a payment pursuant to such guarantee is remote. As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, Eastman entered into an agreement in 1999 that allows it to sell undivided interests in certain domestic trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third party. Under this agreement, receivables sold to the third party totaled $200 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Undivided interests in designated receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the receivables purchased. The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. 46 LIQUIDITY Eastman has access to an $800 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") expiring in July 2005, and to a short term $130 million credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") expiring in July 2002. Any borrowings under the Credit Facility or the Credit Agreement are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates, principally LIBOR. The Credit Facility and the Credit Agreement require facility fees on the total commitment that vary based on Eastmans credit rating. The rate for such fees on the Credit Facility was 0.15% and 0.125% as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The rate for such fees on the Credit Agreement is 0.15%. The Credit Facility and the Credit Agreement contain a number of covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Eastman was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods. Management believes the likelihood of failure to comply with such covenants is remote. Eastman typically utilizes commercial paper, generally with maturities of 90 days or less, to meet its liquidity needs. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Because the Credit Facility expires in July 2005, the commercial paper borrowings are classified as long term borrowings because the Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings long term. As of December 31, 2001, the Companys Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings were $637 million at an effective interest rate of 3.17%. At December 31, 2000, the Companys outstanding balance of commercial paper was $400 million at an effective interest rate of 7.12%. The Company has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $1 billion of debt or equity securities. Access to public debt markets, however, is dependent on a variety of factors including general market conditions and investors perceptions regarding the chemical industry and the Companys expected performance. No securities have been sold from this shelf registration. A downgrade of one level in the Companys credit rating is not anticipated, but should it occur, would not cause a significant impact on the commitments or sources of capital described above and would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. However, an adverse change in the Companys credit rating could affect the renewal of existing credit facilities or the Companys ability to obtain access to new credit facilities in the future, could adversely affect the terms under which the Company can borrow, and could increase the cost of borrowings under such facilities. Cash flows from operations and the sources of capital described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However, the Companys cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw materials availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastmans products, capacity utilization, and other factors described in the forward looking statements beginning on page 50. STOCK REPURCHASES The Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock. In the second quarter 2001, a total of 77,069 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $4 million, or an average price of $53 per share, were repurchased. This repurchase was the result of a reverse/forward stock split of the Companys common stock which was approved by the stockholders on May 3, 2001 in order to consolidate small shareholdings and reduce administrative costs. During 2000, 1,575,000 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $57 million, or an average price of approximately $36 per share, were repurchased under this authorization. A total of 2,746,869 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $112 million, or an average price of approximately $41 per share, has been repurchased under the authorization. Repurchased shares may be used to meet common stock requirements for compensation and benefit plans and other corporate purposes. DIVIDENDS The Company declared cash dividends of $0.44 per share in the fourth quarters of 2001, 2000, and 1999 and $1.76 per share in 2001, 2000, and 1999. 47 ENVIRONMENTAL Certain of the Companys manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur closure/postclosure costs relating to environmental remediation pursuant to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Companys preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, the Company does not believe its liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to Eastmans consolidated financial position, results of operations, or competitive position. The Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs associated with closure/postclosure are accrued over the facilities estimated remaining useful lives which are currently estimated to extend over 50 years. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remedial requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount unless another amount within the range appears to be a better estimate. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the minimum or best estimate of environmental contingencies was approximately $80 million. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had recognized environmental contingencies of approximately $54 million and $49 million, respectively, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and for closure/postclosure costs accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives. The Companys cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately $216 million, $195 million, and $220 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. These amounts pertain primarily to operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also include expenditures for construction and development. The Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Companys planned level of capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. INFLATION In recent years, inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastmans costs, primarily because of price competition among suppliers of raw materials. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments may be utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market price fluctuations. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," collectively referred to as the "Standards." SFAS No. 141 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 16, "Business Combinations." The provisions of SFAS No. 141 require the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001; provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill; and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized. SFAS No. 141 also requires that upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill, based on certain criteria. SFAS No. 142 supersedes APB No. 17, "Intangible Assets," and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets; require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested annually for impairment, and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired; require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill; and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives. 48 The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142 in its first quarter ended March 31, 2002. The Company is in the process of preparing for its adoption of SFAS No. 142 and is making the determinations as to what its reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, other assets, and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company expects to reclassify $12 million of its intangibles assets and the related deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5 million to goodwill. The Company expects that it will no longer record $20 million of amortization relating to its existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles, as adjusted for the reclassifications just mentioned. The Company will also evaluate the useful lives assigned to its intangible assets and anticipates no significant changes to the useful lives or the related amortization expense. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and, in transition, this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year. However, a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step. The Company expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first half of 2002. The second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss (measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption), if any, and must be completed by the end of the Companys fiscal year. Intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year, and pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142 will be completed during the first quarter of 2002. Any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company has not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on the Companys earnings and financial position. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and or normal use of the asset. The Company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 143 January 1, 2003. Upon initial application of the provisions of SFAS No. 143, entities are required to recognize a liability for any existing asset retirement obligations adjusted for cumulative accretion to the date of adoption of this Statement, an asset retirement cost capitalized as an increase to the carrying amount of the associated long lived asset, and accumulated depreciation on that capitalized cost. The cumulative effect, if any, of initially applying this Statement will be recognized as a change in accounting principle. The Company has not yet assessed the impact of this Statement on its financial statements. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for assets to be disposed of and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The provisions of this Statement, which were adopted by the Company January 1, 2002, have not had a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. OUTLOOK For 2002, the Company: Expects capital spending and other directed investments for small acquisitions and other ventures to be no more than expected depreciation and amortization of approximately $370 million; Expects research and development expenditures to be approximately $170 million, and combined costs related to selling and general administrative expenses and research and development costs to be approximately 11% of sales; Expects pension and other postemployment benefit expenses to increase over 2001 and expects that no contribution to the Companys pension plan will be required in 2002; 49 Expects to further integrate recent acquisitions into the Companys processes and SAP R3 and expects that costs related to such implementation will be minimal; Expects to continue to recognize costs related to Cendian, formerly ShipChem, as it builds capability to add new customers; Expects to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and anticipates that excess available cash will be used to reduce outstanding borrowings, fund targeted growth initiatives for small acquisitions and other ventures, and repurchase shares. The Company further expects: Global demand for PET polymers to grow approximately 10% annually over the next four years; To take actions necessary to improve within three years the Companys credit rating to BBB+; Significant cash contributions to the Companys defined benefit pension plans will be required in future years; the amount and timing of such contributions is unknown and significantly impacted by interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, and other factors. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this report may be forward looking in nature as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time relate to such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; legal proceedings; effects of hedging raw material and energy costs and foreign currencies; global and regional economic conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial conditions; expectations and strategies for individual products, businesses, and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman Chemical Company; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans; pension expenses and funding; credit rating; cost reduction targets; integration of recently acquired businesses; development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services, and technologies; asset and product portfolio changes. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, economic conditions, and other factors. These plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements: The Company began operating its Chemicals Group as Eastman Division and its Polymers Group as Voridian Division effective January 1, 2002. The divisional structure for the businesses is expected to allow each to concentrate its respective efforts and resources on strategies specific to the business. There can be no assurance that any or all of such goals or expectations will be realized. The Company has manufacturing and marketing operations throughout the world, with approximately 45% of the Companys revenues attributable to sales outside the United States. Economic factors, including foreign currency exchange rates, could affect the Companys revenues, expenses, and results. Although the Company utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenues, expenses, and results, and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. In addition, changes in laws, regulations, or other political factors in any of the countries in which the Company operates could affect business in that country or region, as well as the Companys results of operations. 50 The Company has made and may continue to make acquisitions, divestitures, and investments, and enter into alliances, as part of its growth strategy. The completion of such transactions are subject to the timely receipt of necessary regulatory and other consents and approvals needed to complete the transactions which could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the satisfactory negotiation of the transaction documents and the fulfillment of all closing conditions to the transactions. Additionally, after completion of the transactions, there can be no assurance that such transactions will be successfully integrated on a timely and cost efficient basis or that they will achieve projected operating earnings targets. The Company has made strategic technology investments, including formation of joint ventures and investments in other technology businesses, in order to build certain Eastman capabilities. There can be no assurance that such investments will achieve their objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Companys results of operations. During 2002, the Company will continue integrating recent acquisitions into the Companys processes and SAP R3 to enable cost saving and synergy opportunities. There can be no assurance that such cost saving and synergy opportunities will be realized or that the integration efforts will be completed as planned. The Company owns assets in the form of equity in other companies, including joint ventures, technology investments and Genencor. Such investments are minority investments in companies which are not managed or controlled by the Company and are subject to all of the risks associated with changes in value of such investments including the market valuation of those companies whose shares are publicly traded. The Company has undertaken and will continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. In addition to cost reduction initiatives, the Company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases, where warranted and accepted by the market; however, the Companys earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized, not be sufficient to cover increased raw materials costs, or have a negative impact on demand and volume. The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw materials costs. There can be no assurance, however, that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. The Companys competitive position in the markets in which it participates is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of the Companys products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of the Companys products. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced. Limitation of the Companys available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations could have a material adverse affect on revenues, expenses, and results. The Companys facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future. The Companys accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are believed to be adequate, but are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The estimates depend on a number of factors including those associated with on going operations and remedial requirements. On going operations can be affected by unanticipated government enforcement action, which in turn is influenced by the nature of the allegation and the complexity of the site. Likewise, changes in chemical control regulations and testing requirements can increase costs or result in product deselection. Remedial requirements at contaminated sites are dependent on the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. 51 The Companys operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and "Forward Looking Statements," and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this filing and elsewhere from time to time, represent managements best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects. 52 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding of foreign operations. To mitigate the Companys exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities, which include short term commercial paper and long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. Currently, these borrowings are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. The Companys operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than two years and denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials. To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, ethane, and natural gas, the Company enters into forwards and options contracts. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis, which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and or commodity prices. For 2001 and 2000, respectively, the market risk associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates of 10% are approximately $81 million and $86 million and an additional $10 million and $9 million for each one percentage point change in interest rates thereafter. This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates. The market risk associated with foreign currency sensitive instruments utilizing a modified Black Scholes option pricing model and a 10% adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency hedged by the Company is approximately $2 million and $8 million and an additional $0.1 million and $0.5 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, for an additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates. Further adverse movements in foreign currencies would create losses in fair value; however, such losses would not be linear to that disclosed above. This exposure, which is primarily related to foreign currency options purchased by the Company to manage fluctuations in foreign currencies, is limited to the dollar value of option premiums payable by the Company for the related financial instruments. Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The market risk associated with feedstock options and natural gas swaps assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10% is approximately $2 million and $9 million and an additional $0.2 million and $0.8 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, for each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter. 53
