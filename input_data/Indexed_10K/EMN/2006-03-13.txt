All references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. 36 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Companys management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, impaired assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Companys management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Companys financial condition and results. These policies require managements more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share is low. However, if one of the Companys key customers were to file for bankruptcy, or otherwise be unable to make its required payments, or there was a significant continued slow down in the economy, the Company could be forced to increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings. For trade receivables of $595 million and $690 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the Companys allowances were $20 million and $15 million, respectively. Impaired Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used, significant changes in business climate, or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset. For long lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or an appraisal. For long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing. 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As the Companys assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change, additional write downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recorded fixed (tangible) asset impairments of $9 million and definite lived intangible asset impairments of $3 million during 2005. The Company recorded fixed (tangible) asset impairments of $134 million, definite lived intangible asset impairments of $5 million, and indefinite lived intangible asset impairments of $1 million during 2004. The Company recorded fixed (tangible) asset impairments of $291 million, definite lived intangible asset impairments of $128 million, indefinite lived intangible asset impairments of $47 million, and goodwill impairments of $34 million during 2003. Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $21 million to the maximum of $42 million at December 31, 2005. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as defined in SFAS No. 143, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset up to 50 years. If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged into earnings could increase or decrease. The Companys reserve for environmental contingencies was $51 million and $56 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and, for asset retirement obligation costs, the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives. United States Pension and Other Post employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets. At December 31, 2005, the Company assumed a discount rate of 5.62 percent and an expected return on assets of 9 percent. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for U.S. pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans: Change in Assumption Impact on 2006 Pre tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2005 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plans Impact on December 31, 2005 Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$6 Million +$52 Million +$23 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $6 Million $47 Million $23 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$2 Million No Impact N/A 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $2 Million No Impact N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Companys pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, and private equities markets. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of approximately 570 grade Aa corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2005, 2004, and 2003 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $56 million, $44 million, and $32 million, respectively. The actual return on assets has exceeded the expected return for the last 3 years and a 1 percent increase or decrease in the health care trend would have had no material impact. The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2006. However, an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, as of December 31, 2006 for the impact on the pensions projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations, see Note 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2005, a valuation allowance of $197 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. 2005 OVERVIEW Sales revenue of $7.1 billion for full year 2005 was the highest in the Companys history and a 7 percent increase over 2004. Operating earnings were $757 million in 2005, a $582 million increase from 2004 and the best since 1995. These results reflect the Companys successful implementation of a turnaround strategy to improve profitability which included extensive restructuring, divestitures, and consolidation within the Company, improved pricing strategies and processes and ongoing cost reductions. The significant increases in sales revenue and operating earnings were primarily driven by increased selling prices throughout the Company in response to increasing raw material and energy costs, and were aided by strong economic growth. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by the successful completion of previously announced restructuring, divestiture and consolidation actions in 2004; a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines across the Companys portfolio of businesses, including acetyl, olefins, and polyester stream optimization; and cost reduction efforts. Included in 2005 results were a $171 million pre tax gain on the sale of the Companys equity investment in Genencor International, Inc. ("Genencor"), a $46 million charge associated with the early repayment of long term debt, and $33 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges. In the second half of 2005, the Company also mitigated the negative effects of the Gulf Coast hurricanes on raw material costs and availability through pricing strategies, effective inventory management and procurement strategies. The Companys cash flow from operations for 2005 increased by $270 million compared with 2004 primarily due to the significant increase in earnings. The Company used cash from operations, combined with proceeds from the sale of the Companys investment in Genencor, to reduce net debt (long and short term debt minus cash and cash equivalents) by $636 million. Throughout 2005, the Company maintained financial discipline while improving profitability. With the successful implementation of the Companys turnaround strategy, as evidenced by the improved operating results and strengthened financial profile, the Company believes that it is positioned for profitable growth. This growth will be focused in markets in which the Company has expertise and deep understanding, and where it can leverage the technological innovation it has built over the past 85 years. 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 The Companys results of operations as presented in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K are summarized and analyzed below: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect Sales $ 7,059 $ 6,580 7% (7)% 15% (1)% % Sales revenue for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to increased selling prices of approximately $1 billion throughout the Company that more than offset a decrease in volume resulting from divested businesses and product lines in 2004. The increase in selling prices was primarily in response to an increase in raw material and energy costs and the Companys efforts to improve profitability. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Gross Profit $ 1,404 $ 978 44 % As a percentage of sales 19.9% 14.9% Gross profit for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to the following factors: increased selling prices across all segments, primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs which increased more than $500 million; a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines; and cost reduction programs. The above items more than offset higher raw material and energy costs primarily attributable to paraxylene, propane, natural gas, coal and ethylene glycol. The Company expects that raw material and energy costs will continue to be volatile during 2006. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") $ 454 $ 450 1 % Research and Development Expenses ("R&D") 162 154 5 % $ 616 $ 604 2 % As a percentage of sales 8.7% 9.2% SG&A costs for 2005 increased slightly compared with 2004 due primarily to higher incentive compensation resulting from improved Company performance and higher bad debt expense, which more than offset decreases resulting from the previous divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") segment and the shutdown of operations at Cendian Corporation ("Cendian"). R&D expenses for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to expenditures on growth initiatives in the Specialty Plastics ("SP") and Developing Businesses ("DB") segments, which more than offset decreases resulting from the previous divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI segment. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Impairments and restructuring charges totaled $33 million during 2005, consisting of non cash asset impairments of $12 million and restructuring charges of $21 million. During 2004, these charges totaled $206 million, consisting of non cash asset impairments of $140 million and restructuring charges of $66 million. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, see Note 16 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other Operating Income Other operating income of $2 million for 2005 included a $2 million gain associated with a change in estimates for contingencies related to the 2004 divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI segment. Other operating income of $7 million in 2004 resulted from the sale of Ariel Research Corporation (Ariel), formerly part of the DB segment. Operating Earnings (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 Change Operating earnings $ 757 $ 175 $ &gt;100% Operating earnings for 2005 increased $582 million. Key factors in the improved results, aided by strong economic growth, were: increased selling prices throughout the Company of approximately $1 billion in response to increasing raw material and energy costs; lower asset impairment and restructuring charges of $33 million in 2005 compared to $206 million in 2004; completion of previously announced restructuring, divestiture and consolidation actions in 2004; a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines across the Companys portfolio of businesses, including acetyl, olefins, and polyester stream optimization; and continued cost reduction efforts. The above items more than offset an estimated $500 million increase in raw materials and energy costs and $33 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges. Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Gross interest costs $ 118 $ 126 Less: capitalized interest 5 3 Interest expense 113 123 (9) % Interest income 13 8 Interest expense, net $ 100 $ 115 (14) % Lower gross interest costs for 2005 compared to 2004 reflected lower average debt levels primarily due to the early extinguishment of debt in second quarter 2005, partially offset by higher average interest rates. Higher interest income for 2005 compared to 2004 reflected higher invested cash balances as well as higher average interest rates, resulting in lower net interest expense. 42 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For 2006, the Company expects net interest expense to decrease compared with 2005 primarily due to lower expected gross interest costs as a result of lower average borrowings, increased capitalized interest and higher interest income. Income from Equity Investment in Genencor Income from equity investment in Genencor includes the Companys portion of earnings from its equity investment in Genencor. In second quarter 2005, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in Genencor for net cash proceeds of approximately $417 million. The book value of the investment prior to sale was $246 million resulting in a pre tax gain on the sale of $171 million. Early Debt Extinguishment Costs In the second quarter 2005, the Company completed the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt for $544 million in cash and recorded a charge of $46 million for early debt extinguishment costs including $2 million in unamortized bond issuance costs. The book value of the purchased debt was $500 million. Other (Income) Charges, net (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Other income $ (11) $ (10) $ (1) Other charges 12 20 (8) Other (income) charges, net $ 1 $ 10 $ (9) Included in other income are the Companys portion of earnings from its equity investments (excluding Genencor); gains on the sale of certain technology business venture investments, royalty income and net gains on foreign exchange transactions. Included in other charges are net losses on foreign exchange transactions, the Companys portion of losses from its equity investments (excluding Genencor); write downs to fair value of certain technology business venture investments due to other than temporary declines in value and fees on securitized receivables. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 226 $ (106) &gt; 100 % Effective tax rate 29 % N/A The 2005 effective tax rate was impacted by $13 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of capital loss carryforward valuation reserves, $14 million of tax benefit resulting from the change in reserves for tax contingencies due to the favorable resolution of prior periods tax contingencies and a $12 million charge resulting from the repatriation of $321 million of foreign earnings and capital pursuant to provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2004 effective tax rate was impacted by $90 million of deferred tax benefits resulting from the expected utilization of a capital loss resulting from the sale of certain businesses and product lines and related assets in the CASPI segment and $26 million of tax benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of a prior year capital loss refund claim. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2004 was impacted by the treatment of asset impairments and restructuring charges resulting in lower expected tax benefits in certain jurisdictions. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2006 will be approximately 33 percent. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Earnings (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 Net earnings $ 557 $ 170 Earnings per share Basic $ 6.90 $ 2.20 Diluted 6.81 2.18 SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are managed and reported in three divisions comprising six operating segments. Eastman Division consists of the CASPI segment, the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment, and the SP segment. Voridian Division contains the Polymers segment and the Fibers segment. The Developing Businesses Division consists of the DB segment. For 2005 and 2004, the Companys divisional structure provided for goods and services to be transferred between the divisions at predetermined prices. Accordingly, the divisional structure resulted in the recognition of interdivisional sales revenue and operating earnings. Such interdivisional transactions are eliminated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. For additional information and analysis of the results of the Companys operating segments, see Note 21 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Exhibits 99.01 and 99.02 to this Annual Report.

Sales revenue for continuing product lines increased $186 million, with selling prices positively impacting revenues 18 percent, driven by cyclical commodity products. The increase in operating earnings was the result of increased selling prices that more than offset higher raw material costs; lower asset impairment and restructuring charges; an increased focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, including the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product lines within the segment; improved gross profit margins, particularly for cyclical commodity product lines; and the impact of cost reduction efforts. Operating earnings for 2005 and 2004 were reduced by asset impairments and restructuring charges totaling approximately $4 million and $81 million, respectively. These charges are more fully described in Note 16 in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Operating earnings for 2005 included $2 million of other operating income related to a change in estimates for contingencies associated with the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product lines within the segment. PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 $ % External sales $ 1,627 $ 1,347 $ 280 21 % Volume effect 64 5 % Price effect 244 18 % Product mix effect (30) (2) % Exchange rate effect 2 % Interdivisional sales 665 583 82 14 % Operating earnings 161 16 145 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 11 38 (27) (71 % The increase in external sales revenue of $280 million was primarily due to higher selling prices which had a positive impact on revenues of $244 million, and higher sales volumes, which had a positive impact on revenues of $64 million. Selling prices and sales volume were higher particularly in the intermediates product lines in response to significant increases in raw material and energy costs, an upturn in the olefins cycle, and improved market conditions in acetyl product lines. The sales volume increase was also attributed to long term arrangements with key customers and increased production capacity. The increase in operating earnings of $145 million was primarily due to increases in selling prices and ongoing cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings for 2005 included $10 million of operating earnings from the achievement of certain milestones under an acetyls technology licensing agreement. Operating earnings for 2005 include $11 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges for previously impaired sites. Operating earnings for 2004 include $38 million in asset impairments related to assets at the Companys Batesville, Arkansas and Longview, Texas facilities, as well as severance charges. The Company continues to identify and implement projects to reduce costs and address the performance of underperforming PCI product lines. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SP Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 $ % External sales $ 718 $ 644 $ 74 12 % Volume effect (2) % Price effect 75 12 % Product mix effect (1) % Exchange rate effect 2 % Interdivisional sales 48 51 (3) (6) % Operating earnings 64 13 51 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 53 (53) % External sales revenue increased $74 million due to higher selling prices, which had a positive impact of $75 million. Despite higher sales volume for copolyester product lines, particularly for consumer and medical goods, overall sales volume declined primarily due to the lower sales volume of acetate used in photographic film. Operating earnings increased by $51 million compared to 2004 due to lower asset impairments and restructuring charges, higher selling prices, improved product mix, and ongoing cost reduction efforts partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs, and expenditures related to growth initiatives. Operating earnings for 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $53 million related primarily to the closure of the Hartlepool, United Kingdom manufacturing facility, as well as severance charges. VORIDIAN DIVISION Polymers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 $ % External sales $ 2,519 $ 2,183 $ 336 15 % Volume effect (97) (5) % Price effect 424 19 % Product mix effect (4) % Exchange rate effect 13 1 % Interdivisional sales 87 69 18 27 % Operating earnings 159 25 134 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 13 (13) % 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The increase in external sales revenue of $336 million was primarily due to increased selling prices, which had a positive impact of $424 million. The increased selling prices were mainly the result of efforts to offset volatile raw material and energy costs. The lower sales volume was attributed to several factors: the effects of higher and volatile raw material and energy costs in North America due to the Gulf Coast hurricanes, including the impact of lower raw material costs for Asian producers of PET polymers to North America and customers working down inventories; and low PET polymers industry operating rates in Europe and Latin America due to a combination of lower than expected demand and overcapacity in southern and eastern Europe and Asian imports in South America. Operating earnings increased as higher selling prices and reduced costs attributed to ongoing cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, resulting in improved margins, primarily in the polyethylene markets and North American PET markets, prior to the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Operating earnings for 2004 were also reduced by asset impairments and restructuring charges of $13 million related to severance. In early March, 2005, the Company broke ground on the first commercial scale PET polymers plant based upon Eastmans IntegRex technology. The plant will be a 350,000 metric ton facility and is expected to begin production in fourth quarter 2006. Research and development efforts further enhanced IntegRex technology in parallel with construction of the first IntegRex manufacturing facility. In September 2005, the Company announced it was evaluating a second world class facility in North America utilizing these further refinements to IntegRex technology. The Company is evaluating its strategic options related to its non integrated PET assets outside the U.S. Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 $ % External sales $ 869 $ 731 $ 138 19 % Volume effect 51 7 % Price effect 76 11 % Product mix effect 10 1 % Exchange rate effect 1 % Interdivisional sales 99 88 11 12 % Operating earnings 207 146 61 42 % External sales revenue increased $138 million due to higher selling prices and increased sales volume. The higher sales volume was attributed to stronger demand for acetate tow, primarily in China, due to higher cigarette production volumes, a trend towards longer cigarette filters and substitution of acetate tow for polypropylene in cigarette filters. Demand for acetate tow in Eastern Europe is increasing due to increased cigarette production volumes. Market share for acetate yarn increased due to the exit of a major competitor from the acetate yarn market. Operating earnings increased due to higher sales volumes and increased selling prices that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. The Company believes the segment has modest growth potential in future years and is evaluating growth options in Europe and Asia. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEVELOPING BUSINESSES DIVISION Developing Businesses Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 $ % External sales $ 27 $ 121 $ (94) (78) % Interdivisional sales 61 424 (363) (86) % Operating loss (70) (86) 16 19 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 18 21 (3) (14)% Other operating income 7 (7) % The decrease in external and interdivisional sales revenue was primarily due to the shutdown of Cendian in the first half of 2005, which resulted in the termination of third party contracts and the reintegration of Cendians logistics functions into the Company, and the divestiture of Ariel in fourth quarter 2004. Operating results for the segment improved due to the shutdown of Cendian and reintegration of the Companys logistics function. Results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $18 million, primarily related to Cendian. With the shutdown of Cendian, the DB segment consists of investments in early stage businesses, which the Company continually evaluates using a disciplined stage gating process. 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 Sales Revenue (excluding interdivisional sales) (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 4,098 $ 3,723 10 % (5) % 19 % (4) % % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,344 1,467 (8) % (15) % 5 % 1 % 1 % Asia Pacific 930 785 18 % 4 % 12 % 2 % % Latin America 687 605 14 % (8) % 20 % 1 % 1% $ 7,059 $ 6,580 Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly for the Polymers, PCI, and CASPI segments, which had a $723 million positive impact on sales revenue. The higher selling prices mostly related to sales of PET polymers, polyethylene, intermediates chemicals, and other cyclical commodity product lines and were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs and high industry wide capacity utilization. Lower overall sales volumes had a $208 million negative impact on sales revenue and were primarily due to the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, partially offset by significantly higher sales volumes in the PCI segment. The Cendian shutdown was reflected in product mix which had a $140 million negative impact on sales revenue. Sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes, mainly the result of the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, which had a $224 million negative impact on sales revenue. Higher selling prices, particularly for PET polymers, had a $77 million positive impact on sales revenue. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher overall selling prices across all segments which had a $92 million positive impact on sales revenue. Higher sales volumes, particularly for the Fibers segment, had a $34 million positive impact on sales revenue. Sales revenue in Latin America increased primarily due to higher selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volume. Higher selling prices, particularly for PET polymers, had a $119 million positive impact on sales revenue. Lower sales volume, particularly for PET polymers and polyethylene, had a $49 million negative impact on sales revenue. With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars and euros. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For more information on these practices see Note 9 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Part II Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 49 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect Sales $ 6,580 $ 5,800 13% 4% 6% 1% 2% Sales revenue increased for 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to increased selling prices, particularly for the Polymers and the PCI segments, increased sales volumes, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, of approximately $363 million, $243 million, and $128 million, respectively. The increase in selling prices was primarily in response to an increase in raw material and energy costs and the Companys efforts to improve profitability. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Gross Profit $ 978 $ 810 21 % As a percentage of sales 14.9 % 14.0 % Gross profit for 2004 increased compared with 2003 primarily due to the following factors: increased selling prices in response to higher raw material costs, particularly in Polymers and PCI, and the Companys continued efforts to improve profitability; increased volumes, excluding restructured, divested, and consolidated businesses and product lines, across all segments due to strengthening general economic conditions and the substitution of other materials with SP and Polymers products; focus on more profitable product lines, achieved by a variety of actions, including restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activity, as well as improving product mix, particularly in CASPI, SP, and Fibers; and improved cost structure through restructuring efforts and cost reduction programs. The above items more than offset higher raw material and energy costs primarily attributable to paraxylene, ethylene glycol, propane, coal, and natural gas. The Company continued to implement a variety of cost control measures to manage discretionary spending. Of the measures taken, a change in vacation policy favorably impacted 2003 results by approximately $40 million. This change in vacation policy did not have a significant impact on 2004 results. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 450 $ 414 9 % Research and Development Expenses 154 173 (11) % $ 604 $ 587 As a percentage of sales 9.2% 10.1% The increase in SG&A expenses for 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher compensation and employee related costs as well as higher professional service fees. Research and development expenses for 2004 were lower compared to 2003 primarily due to reduced labor costs as well as reduced project spending within Voridian Division. 50 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Impairments and restructuring charges totaled $206 million during 2004, consisting of non cash asset impairments of $140 million and restructuring charges of $66 million. These charges totaled $523 million during 2003, consisting of non cash asset impairments of $500 million and restructuring charges of $23 million. Effective January 1, 2004, certain commodity product lines were transferred from the PCI segment to the CASPI segment, which resulted in the reclassification of asset impairment and severance charges of approximately $42 million for 2003. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, see Note 16 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other Operating Income (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Other operating income $ (7) $ (33) $ 26 Other operating income for 2004 totaled approximately $7 million from the gain on sale of Ariel in the fourth quarter, reflected in the DB segment. Other operating income for 2003 totaled approximately $33 million and reflected gains of approximately $20 million on the sale of the Companys high performance crystalline plastic assets in first quarter, and approximately $13 million on the sale of the Companys colorant product lines and related assets in fourth quarter. These items were reflected within the SP and CASPI segments, respectively. Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Gross interest costs $ 126 $ 133 Less: capitalized interest 3 3 Interest expense 123 130 (5) % Interest income 8 6 Interest expense, net $ 115 $ 124 (7) % Lower gross interest costs for 2004 compared to 2003 reflected lower average debt levels due to paydown of debt throughout the year, which were partially offset by higher average interest rates. Operating Earnings (Loss) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2004 2003 Operating earnings (loss) $ 175 $ (267) Operating results for 2004 increased $442 million over results for 2003. This improvement included a $317 million reduction in asset impairments and restructuring charges partially offset by lower other operating income of $26 million. In addition, earnings were positively impacted by the following factors: increased selling prices of approximately $350 million; increased volumes, excluding restructured, divested, and consolidated businesses and product lines; focus on more profitable product lines and the impact of favorable product mix; improved cost structure; and favorable impact of foreign exchange. 51 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The above items more than offset an estimated $600 million increase in raw materials and energy costs. Other operating income of $7 million in 2004 resulted from the sale of Ariel, formerly part of the Companys DB segment. Other operating income in 2003 included a $20 million gain from the sale of the Companys high performance crystalline plastics assets, which were formerly a part of the SP segment, and a gain of $13 million from the sale of the Companys colorant product lines and related assets, which were formerly part of the CASPI segment. Operating results for 2003 were impacted by a reduction in costs of approximately $40 million as a result of the previously discussed change in vacation policy. This policy was part of cost reduction measures implemented by the Company in the first quarter 2003. This change in policy impacted 2003 only. Also positively impacting 2003 results was a gain of approximately $14 million recorded as a credit to cost of sales on the earnings statement from the insurance settlement related to the 2002 operational disruptions at the Companys Rotterdam, the Netherlands and Columbia, South Carolina facilities. Other (Income) Charges, net (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Other income $ (10) $ (18) $ 8 Other charges 20 18 2 Other (income) charges, net $ 10 $ $ 10 Included in other income are the Companys portion of earnings from its equity investments (excluding Genencor), gains on the sale of certain technology business venture investments, royalty income, and net gains on foreign exchange transactions. For both periods presented, included in other charges are net losses on foreign exchange transactions, the Companys portion of losses from its equity investments (excluding Genencor), write downs to fair value of certain technology business venture investments due to other than temporary declines in value, and fees on securitized receivables. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (106) $ (108) (2.0) % Effective tax rate N/A 28% The 2004 effective tax rate was impacted by $90 million of deferred tax benefits resulting from the expected utilization of a capital loss resulting from the sale of certain businesses and product lines and related assets in the CASPI segment and $26 million of tax benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of a prior year capital loss refund claim. In addition, the effective tax rates for both 2004 and 2003 were impacted by the treatment of asset impairments and restructuring charges resulting in lower expected tax benefits in certain jurisdictions. The 2003 effective tax rate was also impacted by non deductible goodwill impairments. Both rates are impacted by the impact of foreign rate variances and extraterritorial income exclusion benefits on normal taxable earnings. In both years, the Company recorded benefits from the extraterritorial income exclusion. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles, Net (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net $ $ 3 52 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SFAS No. 143 As required by SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, at January 1, 2003, the Company recognized existing asset retirement obligations adjusted for cumulative accretion to the date of adoption, asset retirement costs capitalized as an increase to the carrying amount of the associated long lived asset and accumulated depreciation on those capitalized costs. As a result of adoption of this standard, the Company recognized an after tax credit to earnings of $3 million during the first quarter 2003, primarily related to a reduction in certain environmental liabilities. For more information regarding SFAS No. 143, see Note 24 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K.

(2)Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which remain and were reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments subsequent to restructure, consolidation and divestiture. On July 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of certain businesses, product lines and related assets within the CASPI segment. This sale includes portions of the resins and monomers, and inks and graphic arts product groups. As a result, the Company has presented CASPI segment sales revenue, operating earnings, and asset impairments and restructuring charges for restructured, divested, and consolidated product lines and continuing product lines. For additional information, see Exhibits 99.01 and 99.02 filed with this report. 54 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS External sales revenue decreased $129 million due to lower sales volume resulting from the divestiture discussed above. Excluding the sales from these sources for both 2004 and 2003, sales revenue increased by 15 percent primarily due to an 11 percent increase in volume. Continuing businesses benefited from improved end market demand attributable to strong economic growth and successful marketing of existing products in new applications. Operating earnings increased $453 million due to lower asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $381 million as well as a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, increased sales volume, and continued cost reduction efforts that were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs, especially propane. PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 $ % External sales $ 1,347 $ 1,098 $ 249 23 % Volume effect 133 12 % Price effect 117 11 % Product mix effect (10) (1) % Exchange rate effect 9 1 % Interdivisional sales 583 495 88 18 % Operating earnings 16 (45) 61 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 38 57 (19) The increase in external sales revenue of $249 million was primarily due to increased sales volume and higher selling prices. The increase in volume had a positive impact on sales revenue of $133 million and was attributable to improved end market demand as a result of strong economic growth and implementation of long term supply arrangements with key customers. Additionally, higher selling prices, as a result of significantly increased raw material and energy costs, had a positive impact on sales revenues of $117 million. The increase in interdivisional sales was due to both higher selling prices as a result of higher raw material and energy costs and increased volume. Operating earnings increased $61 million, partially due to a decrease in asset impairment and restructuring charges of $19 million. Operating earnings were also favorably impacted by higher sales volume, higher selling prices, and continued cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw materials and energy prices. Volume growth was primarily due to improved end market demand as a result of strong economic growth, implementation of long term supply arrangements with key customers and debottlenecking of production capacity at the Longview, Texas site. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $38 million in 2004 relate to manufacturing facilities in the Companys Batesville, Arkansas and Longview, Texas sites. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $57 million in 2003 related to the Companys manufacturing site in Llangefni, Wales. 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SP Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 $ % External sales $ 644 $ 559 $ 85 15 % Volume effect 65 12 % Price effect 6 1 % Product mix effect % Exchange rate effect 14 2 % Interdivisional sales 51 49 2 4 % Operating earnings 13 63 (50) ( 79) % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 53 1 52 Other operating income 20 (20) The increase in external sales revenue of $85 million for 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher sales volume attributed to strong market demand for products in both new and existing applications including eyewear, housewares, and cosmetics packaging in North America and Asia Pacific regions. The increase in volume had a positive impact on sales revenue of $65 million. Operating earnings for 2004 decreased $50 million compared with 2003 primarily due to asset impairments and restructuring charges of $53 million related primarily to the closure of the Hartlepool, United Kingdom manufacturing site as well as severance charges related to the Companys employee separation programs. Operating earnings in 2003 included a gain of $20 million on the sale of the segments high performance crystalline plastics assets. In addition, the operating earnings improved year over year due to increased sales volumes, a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, and continued cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw materials and energy costs.

Higher selling prices had a positive impact on sales revenue of $211 million, primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs and improving market conditions in the second half of 2004. The volume increase was mostly a result of continued strong end market demand for PET polymers and continued substitution for other competitive materials in North America, Latin America, and Europe and had a positive impact on sales revenue of $156 million. Operating earnings decreased $37 million, including an asset impairment and restructuring charge increase of $11 million. Operating earnings were also impacted by increased selling prices and higher sales volumes that were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene and ethylene glycol. Included in the 2003 results is a $14 million gain in 2003 from an insurance settlement related to the 2002 operational disruptions at the Companys Rotterdam, the Netherlands and Columbia, South Carolina facilities.

Increased sales volume had a positive impact of $83 million and improved product mix had a $17 million impact on revenue. The increase in sales volume and favorable shift in product mix were primarily attributable to acetyl chemicals in North America and acetate tow in the Asia Pacific region. Operating earnings increased $21 million primarily due to increased sales volume that was partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. DEVELOPING BUSINESSES DIVISION Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 $ % External sales $ 121 $ 69 $ 52 75 % Interdivisional sales 424 396 28 7 % Operating earnings (86) (65) (21) (32) % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 21 21 Other operating income 7 7 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS External sales revenue increased $52 million primarily due to the implementation of third party contracts at Cendian. The increase in interdivisional sales revenue for 2004 was primarily due to the increase in logistics services provided by Cendian to Eastman Division and Voridian Division business segments and the increase in sales volumes in those segments. Operating losses increased $21 million primarily due to asset impairments and restructuring charges of $21 million mainly related to the restructuring of Cendian. Also included in 2004 operating results was a $7 million gain from the sale of Ariel. In 2004, the operating results for the DB segment were below the Companys expectations, primarily due to the inability of Cendian to achieve sufficient margins to offset operating costs. As a result, the Company decided it would reintegrate its logistics function. This reintegration was completed in second quarter 2005. SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 Sales Revenue (excluding interdivisional sales) (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 3,723 $ 3,302 13 % 6 % 8 % (1) % % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,467 1,368 7 % (5) % 2 % 1 % 9 % Asia Pacific 785 643 22 % 9 % 6 % 6 % 1 % Latin America 605 487 24 % 11 % 11 % 1 % 1% $ 6,580 $ 5,800 The increase in sales revenue in the United States and Canada for 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly for the Polymers and PCI segment, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of $247 million. The higher selling prices mostly related to sales of intermediates chemicals, PET polymers, and polyethylene, and were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs and high industry wide capacity utilization. While the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment had a negative impact on sales revenue, overall higher sales volumes, particularly for the Polymers and PCI segment, had a positive impact on sales revenue of $192 million. 2004 sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa increased compared with 2003 due to favorable shifts in foreign currency exchange rates which had a positive impact on sales revenue of $119 million, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro. 2004 sales volume declined 4 percent due to the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment. In all other segments, 2004 sales volumes increased compared to 2003. 2004 sales revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased significantly compared with 2003 primarily due to higher sales volume, particularly in the Fibers segment, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of $57 million. A favorable shift in product mix and higher selling prices, particularly for intermediates products in the PCI segment, contributed $42 million and $36 million, respectively, to sales revenue. 2004 sales revenue in Latin America increased significantly compared with 2003 primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher selling prices, primarily related to PET polymers, each of which had a positive impact on sales revenue of $55 million. 58 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash Flows (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 764 $ 494 $ 244 Investing activities (18) (148) (160) Financing activities (547) (579) 397 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 199 $ (233) $ 481 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 524 $ 325 $ 558 Cash provided by operating activities increased $270 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily as a result of a significant increase in earnings and a decrease in working capital requirements, partially offset by $165 million in contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The decrease in working capital requirements related primarily to accounts receivable, largely the result of improved collection performance which more than offset the increase in sales, partially offset by an increase in inventories. The Company made $3 million in contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2004. Cash provided by operating activities increased $250 million in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily as a result of a reduction in cash funding for U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Contributions to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $238 million in 2003. In addition, net earnings increased in 2004 due to higher gross margins and lower asset impairment charges, and were partially offset by additional increases in working capital, primarily accounts receivable. The additional increase in accounts receivable was the result of the significant increase in sales in fourth quarter 2004 partially offset by improved collection performance. Cash used in investing activities decreased $130 million in 2005 compared with 2004 largely due to $417 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Companys investment in Genencor in the second quarter 2005. In addition, in the second quarter 2005, the Company received payment for the $50 million note it received in the sale of certain businesses and product lines in the CASPI segment. In 2004, the Company received $115 million in net cash proceeds associated with such sale, as well as $12 million in proceeds from the sale of Ariel. In the fourth quarter 2005, the Company provided a line of credit up to $125 million to Primester, a joint venture in which Eastman has a 50 percent interest, which Primester fully utilized to repay its third party borrowings, which had previously been guaranteed by Eastman. In addition, the Company used an additional $95 million for additions to properties and equipment in 2005 as compared with 2004. Cash used in investing activities in 2004 decreased $12 million compared with 2003. In 2004, the Company sold certain businesses and product lines in its CASPI segment as well as Ariel, resulting in total net proceeds of $127 million. In 2003, the Company sold its high performance crystalline plastics assets and its colorant product lines and related assets for $70 million. The Company used an additional $18 million for additions to properties and equipment in 2004 as compared with 2003. In 2003, the Company received a return of a deposit of approximately $15 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2005 totaled $547 million and included the Companys early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt, and a decrease in credit facility and other short term borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $150 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $98 million. See Note 8 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K for information regarding the early extinguishment of debt. In addition, the Company borrowed $191 million from a new credit facility in the fourth quarter 2005, the proceeds of which provided a significant part of the funding for the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cash used in financing activities in 2004 totaled $579 million and reflects the January 2004 repayment of $500 million of 6 3/8% notes and a decrease in commercial paper, credit facility, and other short term borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $19 million, offset by cash from stock option exercises of $77 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2003 totaled $397 million primarily due to proceeds from long term borrowings of $495 million and an increase in commercial paper and other short term borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $39 million. The payment of dividends is also reflected in financing activities in all periods. In 2006, priorities for use of available cash will be to pay the quarterly cash dividend, fund targeted growth initiatives, and fund defined benefit pension plans. Liquidity At December 31, 2005, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and foreign banks totaling approximately $890 million. These credit facilities consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") expiring in April 2009, and a 160 million euro credit facility (" the Euro Facility") which expires in December, 2010 and has options for two one year extensions. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. These credit facilities require facility fees on the total commitment that are based on Eastmans credit rating. In addition, these credit facilities contain a number of covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Eastman was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2005, the Companys credit facility borrowings totaled $214 million at a weighted average interest rate of 3.01 percent. At December 31, 2004, the Companys credit facility borrowings were $146 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.98 percent. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since the Credit Facility expires in April 2009, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long term borrowings because the Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis. Eastman fully utilized the Euro Facility in the fourth quarter 2005 by borrowing $189 million. These funds comprised a significant portion of the funding for the 2005 repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The Company has effective shelf registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a combined $1.1 billion of debt or equity securities. In the second quarter 2005, Eastman completed the sale of its equity interest in Genencor for approximately $417 million in net cash proceeds after tax. This action, combined with strong operating results, allowed the Company to complete the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding debt in second quarter 2005, further strengthening its financial position. During 2005, the Company contributed $165 million to U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company anticipates contributing approximately $75 million to U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2006. Cash flows from operations and the sources of capital described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements including those requirements related to the normal seasonal increase in working capital expected in the first half of the year. However, the Companys cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw materials availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastmans products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. Furthermore, the Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. 60 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $343 million, $248 million, and $230 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase of $95 million in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to spending on the new PET facility in South Carolina, utilizing IntegRex technology, as well as other growth initiatives. The Company expects that 2006 capital spending will be up to $450 million which will exceed estimated 2006 depreciation and amortization of approximately $300 million. In 2006, the Company will continue to pursue projects including a copolyester intermediates expansion, the new PET facility in South Carolina, utilizing IntegRex technology, and other growth initiatives. Other Commitments At December 31, 2005, the Companys obligations related to notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.4 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 20 years. Other borrowings, related primarily to credit facility borrowings, totaled approximately $214 million. The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2005 totaling approximately $1.7 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month to month operating leases totaling approximately $208 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 15 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities and land; and approximately 35 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2005 totaling approximately $1.2 billion related to pension, retiree medical, and other post employment obligations. The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Payments Due For Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liablities (a) Total 2006 $ 4 $ $ 291 $ 44 $ 134 $ 473 2007 282 36 87 405 2008 72 177 23 68 340 2009 12 25 172 19 65 293 2010 189 162 16 62 429 2011 and beyond 1,323 658 70 765 2,816 Total $ 1,411 $ 214 $ 1,742 $ 208 $ 1,181 $ 4,756 (a) Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company for pension and other post employment benefits in the periods indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. 61 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Notes and debentures at December 31, 2005 decreased approximately $500 million compared with December 31, 2004 primarily due to the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt during second quarter 2005. Credit facility borrowings increased approximately $70 million at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 due to the funding for the 2005 repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. Purchase obligations decreased approximately $200 million at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 due to consumption of ethylene glycol and polypropylene under existing contracts. Other liabilities decreased approximately $120 million at December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004 due primarily to contributions to the Companys defined benefit pension plans. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that a material payment pursuant to such guarantees in excess of the payments included above is remote. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2005 totaled $85 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment. Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $4 million, $27 million, and $54 million will expire in 2006, 2008, and 2012, respectively. As described in Note 5 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at the Companys Kingsport, Tennessee plant. During fourth quarter 2005, the Company provided a line of credit to the joint venture of up to $125 million, which Primester fully utilized to pay the principal amount of the joint ventures third party borrowings, previously guaranteed by Eastman. As described in Note 11 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Eastman entered into an agreement in 1999 that allows it to generate cash by reducing its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third party. Under this agreement, receivables sold to the third party totaled $200 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Undivided interests in designated receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the purchased interest in the receivable pools. The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. The Company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees related to the third party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has concluded that the entities are not Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) or, in the case of Primester, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As such, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation Number 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R"), the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In addition, the Company has evaluated long term purchase obligations with two entities that may be VIEs at December 31, 2005. These potential VIEs are joint ventures from which the Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and purchases approximately $60 million of raw materials and utilities on an annual basis. The Company has no equity interest in these entities and has confirmed that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the potential VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company has not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the entities are VIEs, and if one or both are VIEs, whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary. 62 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and non consolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur. Non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or liquidity. See Note 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K for off balance sheet post employment benefit obligations. Treasury Stock Transactions The Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock. No shares of Eastman common stock were repurchased by the Company during 2005, 2004 or 2003. A total of 2,746,869 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $112 million, or an average price of approximately $41 per share, have been repurchased under the authorization. Repurchased shares may be used to meet common stock requirements for compensation and benefit plans and other corporate purposes. Dividends The Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share for a total of $1.76 per share in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Adequate reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastmans policies as described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Companys preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $21 million to the maximum of $42 million at December 31, 2005. 63 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ("FIN 47"), which was effective for the Company on December 31, 2005. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation also clarifies that the term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation ("CARO") refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company performed a thorough examination of various asset categories. Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately 60 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2005. Currently, the Companys environmental assets are expected to be no longer useable at different times over the next 50 years. If the Company were to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastmans costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market price fluctuations. For additional information see Note 9 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4. The Statement adopts the International Accounting Standards Boards view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. Additionally, the Statement clarifies the meaning of the term normal capacity. The provisions of this Statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS No. 151 and determined that it does not materially impact its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results from operations. 64 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In December, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(Revised), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". SFAS No. 123(R) requires all companies that award their employees stock based compensation to recognize these transactions in their financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award. This differs from the requirements of SFAS No. 123 which permitted the option of adopting SFAS No. 123 and reflecting these transactions in the financial statements or the continued application of APB Opinion No. 25 requiring only pro forma disclosure of the effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if SFAS No. 123 had been adopted. Through the end of 2005, the Company has elected to continue the application of APB Opinion No. 25 with the pro forma disclosure required for SFAS No. 123. However, the Company is required to implement the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the Company, as of the required effective date of application, to implement the standard using a modified version of prospective application. Under this method, compensation expense is recognized for the following: 1) the portion of outstanding awards at the effective date of implementation for which the requisite employee service has not yet been rendered, based upon the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS No. 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes, and 2) all new awards, modified awards, repurchased awards, or cancelled awards after the effective date of implementation. Under previous reporting guidance, the following types of share based compensation awards have been recorded in the financial statements: 1) unrestricted common stock awards, 2) restricted common stock awards, 3) stock appreciation rights payable in cash and 4) long term performance awards payable in the form of shares of common stock or cash. The implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) includes the additional requirement to recognize compensation expense of stock option awards in the financial statements. The outstanding quantity and value of existing stock option awards at December 31, 2005 for which the requisite service period has not been provided and for which compensation expense will be recognized in the financial statements after the effective date of application total 1,990,617 options and approximately $17 million over three years. The Company did not modify any awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 to affect early vesting which would have eliminated the required service period to be provided after the effective date of application and eliminated recognition of compensation expense related thereto. Further, there have not been any changes in the quantity or type of share based payment awards solely due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). The determination of the grant date fair value of share based compensation awards is based upon observable prices of financial equity instruments actively traded in open markets or, if not available, as in the case of the Companys stock option awards and stock appreciation rights awards, an option pricing financial model should be used to estimate the fair value of the award. Eastman has relied upon the use of the Black Scholes Merton model to determine the value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights under SFAS No. 123 and will continue to do so under SFAS No. 123(R). As discussed in Note 15 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K, the use of any financial model may require the use of highly subjective input assumptions that may materially affect the fair value estimate. Refer to this footnote to review these assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003. All share based employee compensation expense will be reflected in the earnings statement within the selling, general and administrative expense line item with an offset to paid in capital or non current liabilities in the statement of financial position dependent upon classification as a liability award or equity award. Awards classified as liabilities require the use of cash or other assets to effect payment while equity awards reflect payment through stock issuances. The federal income tax and state income tax consequences of recognition for share based compensation are reflected in the earnings statement as a credit to current period income tax expense with an offset in the statement of financial position as deferred income taxes in the other non current assets line item. Additionally, SFAS No. 123(R) requires that cash inflows related to the realized tax benefits in excess of the amount recorded in the financial statements be recognized in the statement of cash flows as a cash inflow from financing and a cash outflow from operating activities. 65 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OUTLOOK For 2006, the Company expects: that the volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and that the Company will continue to pursue pricing strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit; strong volumes will be maintained due to continued economic strength, continued substitution of Eastman products for other materials, and new applications for existing products; that pension and other post employment benefit expenses will be similar to 2005 levels; to contribute approximately $75 million to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plans; net interest expense to decrease compared with 2005 primarily as a result of anticipated lower average borrowings, increased capitalized interest and higher interest income; the effective tax rate to be approximately 33 percent; to continue to evaluate its portfolio, which could lead to further restructuring, divestiture, or consolidation of product lines as it continues to focus on profitability; capital expenditures to increase to up to $450 million and exceed estimated depreciation and amortization of approximately $300 million; in 2006, the Company plans to complete construction of the new PET facility in South Carolina, utilizing IntegRex technology, and pursue a copolyester intermediates expansion and other targeted growth initiatives; and that priorities for use of available cash will be to pay the quarterly cash dividend and fund targeted growth initiatives and defined benefit pension plans. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K may be forward looking in nature as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs and foreign currencies; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses, segments and divisions as well as for the whole of Eastman Chemical Company; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; integration of acquired businesses; development, production, commercialization and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. 66 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described in this report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements: The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material costs. There can be no assurance, however, that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. In addition, natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities, or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business, or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials, could affect availability and costs of raw materials. While temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability and price are impacted by natural disasters, plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market and political conditions, changes in government regulation, and war or other outbreak of hostilities. Eastmans operations or products may, at times, be adversely affected by these factors. The Companys competitive position in the markets in which it participates is, in part, subject to external factors in addition to those that the Company can impact. Natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities, or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business, or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials, could negatively impact the Companys competitive position and its ability to maintain market share. For example, supply and demand for certain of the Companys products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of the Companys products. Limitation of the Companys available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations, including natural disasters, could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue, costs and results of operations and financial condition. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of the largest customers could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. In addition, the Companys competitive position may be adversely impacted by low cost competitors in certain regions and customers developing internal or alternative sources of supply. In addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives, the Company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases where warranted and accepted by the market; however, the Companys earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized, not be sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs, or have a negative impact on demand and volume. There can be no assurances that price increases will be realized or will be realized within the Companys anticipated timeframe. The Company is endeavoring to exploit growth opportunities in certain core businesses by developing new products, expanding into new markets, and tailoring product offerings to customer needs. There can be no assurance that such efforts will result in financially successful commercialization of such products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets. 67 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company has made, and intends to continue making, strategic investments, including IntegRex technology, and has entered, and expects to continue to enter, into strategic alliances in technology, services businesses, and other ventures in order to build, diversify, and strengthen certain Eastman capabilities and to maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets. There can be no assurance that such investments and alliances will achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Companys results of operations. The Company has undertaken and expects to continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. The Companys facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future. The Companys accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. The Company and its operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating losses. The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Companys ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and elsewhere from time to time, represents managements best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects. 68 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations. To mitigate the Companys exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis, which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities, which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. Currently, these borrowings are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. In 2005, for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, the Company changed to a one percent absolute shift in interest rates from a 10 percent relative shift in interest rates which was used in 2004. For 2005 and 2004, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of 1 percent were approximately $134 million and $158 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates. The Companys operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts or currency options. For 2005, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $19 million and an additional $1.9 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. For 2004, the market risks associated with forward exchange contracts utilizing a modified Black Scholes option pricing model and a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency hedged by the Company were approximately $15 million and an additional $1.4 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2004, the Companys outstanding borrowings denominated in foreign currencies were immaterial. Further adverse movements in foreign currencies would create losses in fair value; however, such losses would not be linear to that disclosed above. This exposure, which is primarily related to foreign currency options purchased by the Company to manage fluctuations in foreign currencies, is limited to the dollar value of option premiums payable by the Company for the related financial instruments. Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy. To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane and natural gas, the Company enters into forwards and options contracts. For 2005 and 2004, the market risks associated with options and swaps for feedstock and natural gas assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent were $2 million and $1 million, respectively, and an additional $0.1 million for each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter for both periods. 69
