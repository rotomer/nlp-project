All references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. 32 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Companys management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, impaired assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Companys management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Companys financial condition and results. These policies require managements more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share is low. However, if one of the Companys key customers were to file for bankruptcy, or otherwise be unable to make its required payments, or there was a significant continued slowdown in the economy, the Company could be forced to increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings. For trade receivables of $698 million and $595 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Companys allowances were $16 million and $20 million, respectively. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used, significant changes in business climate, or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset. For long lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or an appraisal. For long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing. 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As the Companys assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change, additional write downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recorded fixed (tangible) asset impairments of $55 million and definite lived intangible asset impairments of $1 million during 2006. The Company recorded fixed (tangible) asset impairments of $9 million and definite lived intangible asset impairments of $3 million during 2005. Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $18 million to the maximum of $32 million at December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as defined in SFAS No. 143, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years. If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged into earnings could increase or decrease. In accordance with Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ("FIN 47"), the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The Companys reserve for environmental contingencies was $47 million and $51 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and, for asset retirement obligation costs, the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives. United States Pension and Other Post employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets. At December 31, 2006, the Company assumed a discount rate of 5.86 percent and an expected return on assets of 9 percent. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. 34 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for U.S. pension plan and other postretirement welfare plans: Change in Assumption Impact on 2007 Pre tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2006 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plan Impact on December 31, 2006 Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5 Million +$49 Million +$21 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5 Million $46 Million $21 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$3 Million No Impact N/A 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $3 Million No Impact N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Companys pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, and private equities markets. The actual return on assets has exceeded the expected return for the last 3 years. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations. A 1 percent increase or decrease in the health care trend would have had no material impact. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2006, 2005, and 2004 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $54 million, $56 million, and $44 million, respectively. The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2007. However, an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, as of December 31, 2007 for the impact on the pensions projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2006, a valuation allowance of $130 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. 2006 OVERVIEW The Company generated sales revenue of $7.5 billion for full year 2006, which was the highest in the Companys history and a 6 percent increase over 2005. Operating earnings were $640 million in 2006, a decline of $117 million compared with 2005. These results reflect continued strong earnings from the Companys broad base of businesses, with the decline substantially due to lower results in the Performance Polymers segment. During 2006, the Company was impacted by $400 million higher raw material and energy costs. Most of the Companys businesses were able to offset these costs with higher selling prices, higher volumes and lower operating costs. However, the Performance Polymers segment had lower selling prices, particularly for polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") polymers, in spite of higher raw material costs, due to lower industry capacity utilization rates. The Company continued to evaluate its portfolio of businesses and product lines to better focus on its core strengths and improve overall profitability. As a result of the strategic decisions made, operating earnings were negatively impacted by $10 million of accelerated depreciation and $101 million in asset impairment and restructuring charges. These charges were partially offset by $68 million of other operating income from the sale of its polyethylene ("PE") business and related assets and the sale of its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets. In 2006, these divested product lines had sales revenue of $811 million and operating earnings of $124 million. Operating earnings in 2005 included asset impairments and restructuring charges were $33 million and other operating income was $2 million. 36 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In addition to achieving the above results, Eastman continued to progress on its overall growth objectives and announced its plans to improve the performance of its PET polymer product lines in the Performance Polymers segment. These efforts included: the start up of the Companys 350 thousand metric tons new PET facility using IntegRex technology in Columbia, South Carolina which is expected to be at full production by the end of the first quarter of 2007; plans to debottleneck the IntegRex technology facility for an additional 100 thousand metric tons of capacity, to be completed in early 2008; rationalizing 350 thousand metric tons of existing capacity in North America, to be completed by mid 2008; plans to expand its acetate tow capacity in Workington, England in the Fibers segment; continuing development of a new family of copolyesters in the Specialty Plastics ("SP") segment to be commercialized in 2007; and furthering the advancement of its coal gasification efforts. The Company is also considering various strategic options for its underperforming PET manufacturing facilities outside the United States that could lead to further restructuring, divestiture, or consolidation of product lines in the Performance Polymers segment to improve profitability. In first quarter 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the San Roque, Spain manufacturing facility. Net earnings for 2006 were $409 million versus 2005 net earnings of $557 million. Included in 2005 results were a $111 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of the Companys equity investment in Genencor International, Inc. ("Genencor") and early debt retirement costs of $28 million, net of tax. The Company generated $609 million in cash from operating activities during 2006, a decrease of $160 million compared to 2005. The decline was due primarily to higher net earnings in 2005 compared with 2006 and an increase of $128 million in working capital in 2006, partially offset by lower pension contributions in the current year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 The Companys results of operations as presented in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K are summarized and analyzed below: Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Sales $ 7,450 $ 7,059 6 % 2 % 5 % (1) % % Sales revenue for 2006 increased compared with 2005 primarily due to higher selling prices in response to both higher raw material and energy costs and continued strong economic conditions. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Gross Profit $ 1,277 $ 1,404 (9) % As a percentage of sales 17.1% 19.9% 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales for 2006 decreased, particularly in the Performance Polymers segment, compared with 2005 primarily due to increased raw material and energy costs and operational disruptions that were partially offset by higher selling prices. In 2006, raw material and energy costs increased by approximately $400 million compared to the prior year, compared to a selling price increase of $323 million. In addition, 2006 included $10 million of accelerated depreciation related to previously disclosed restructuring decisions in association with cracking units in Longview, Texas, and higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina, which are scheduled for shutdown. In 2007, accelerated depreciation will be approximately $50 million related to these assets. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") $ 437 $ 454 (4) % Research and Development Expenses ("R&D") 167 162 3 % $ 604 $ 616 (2) % As a percentage of sales 8.1% 8.7% SG&A expenses in 2006 decreased compared to 2005 primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense in 2006, which included compensation expense recorded under SFAS No. 123 Revised December 2004 ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), "Share Based Payment". For more information concerning SFAS No. 123(R), see Note 15, "Share Based Compensation Plans and Awards", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. R&D expenses for 2006 increased compared with 2005 primarily due to increased spending on growth initiatives, particularly in the SP segment, which more than offset lower expenses in the Performance Polymers segment. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $101 million and $33 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company continues to review its portfolio of products and businesses, which could result in further restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, see Note 16, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other Operating Income Other operating income for 2006 reflects a gain of $75 million on the sale of the Companys PE and Epolene polymer businesses, related assets, and the Companys ethylene pipeline and charges of approximately $7 million related to the sale of the Companys Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and its related assets and product lines. For more information concerning divestitures, see Note 24, "Divestitures", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other operating income for 2005 reflects a $2 million gain related to the 2004 divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") segment. 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Gross interest costs $ 112 $ 118 Less: capitalized interest 7 5 Interest expense 105 113 (7) % Interest income 25 13 Interest expense, net $ 80 $ 100 (20) % Lower gross interest costs for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected lower average borrowings that more than offset higher average interest rates. Higher interest income for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected higher invested cash balances as well as higher average interest rates, resulting in lower net interest expense. For 2007, the Company expects net interest expense to decrease compared with 2006 primarily due to higher interest income, driven by higher invested cash balances. Income from Equity Investment in Genencor For 2005, income from equity investment in Genencor includes the Companys portion of earnings from its equity investment in Genencor. In second quarter 2005, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in Genencor for net cash proceeds of approximately $417 million. The book value of the investment prior to sale was $246 million resulting in a pre tax gain on the sale of $171 million. Early Debt Extinguishment Costs In the second quarter 2005, the Company completed the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt for $544 million in cash and recorded a charge of $46 million for early debt extinguishment costs including $2 million in unamortized bond issuance costs. The book value of the purchased debt was $500 million. Other (Income) Charges, net (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Other income $ (24) $ (11) $ (13) Other charges 8 12 (4) Other (income) charges, net $ (16) $ 1 $ (15) Included in other income are the Companys portion of net earnings from its equity investments (excluding Genencor); gains on the sale of certain technology business venture investments, royalty income, net gains on foreign exchange transactions and other non operating income, related to Holston Defense Corporation ("HDC"). Included in other charges are net losses on foreign exchange transactions, the Companys portion of losses from its equity investments (excluding Genencor); write downs to fair value of certain technology business venture investments due to other than temporary declines in value and fees on securitized receivables. 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Included in 2006 other income is a $12 million gain related to a favorable award from the U.S. Department of the Army regarding a request for reimbursement for post employment benefits being provided to retirees of HDC, a wholly owned subsidiary. This gain reflected a portion of the unrecognized gain resulting from the award that will be amortized into earnings over future periods. For additional information, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Provision for Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Provision for income taxes $ 167 $ 226 (26) % Effective tax rate 29 % 29 % The 2006 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported operating earnings before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 33 percent. The effective tax rate was impacted by $25 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of capital loss carryforward valuation reserves and $11 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of foreign net operating loss valuation reserves. The 2005 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported operating earnings before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 35 percent. The effective tax rate was impacted by $13 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of capital loss carryforward valuation reserves, $14 million of tax benefit resulting from the change in reserves for tax contingencies due to the favorable resolution of prior periods tax contingencies and a $11 million charge resulting from the repatriation of $321 million of foreign earnings and capital pursuant to provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2007 will be approximately 35 percent. Net Earnings (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 Net earnings $ 409 $ 557 Earnings per share Basic $ 4.98 $ 6.90 Diluted 4.91 6.81 SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are managed and reported in five reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment, the Performance Polymers segment and the SP segment. The Companys segments were previously aligned in a divisional structure that provided for goods and services to be transferred between divisions at predetermined prices that may have been in excess of cost, which resulted in the recognition of intersegment sales revenue and operating earnings. Such interdivisional transactions were eliminated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In first quarter 2006, the Company realigned its organizational structure to support its growth strategy and to better reflect the integrated nature of the Companys assets. A result of the realigned organizational structure is that goods and services are transferred among the segments at cost. As part of this change, the Companys segment results have been restated to eliminate the impact of interdivisional sales revenue and operating earnings. For additional information and analysis of the results of the Companys operating segments, see Note 21, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Exhibits 99.01to this Annual Report. In the first quarter of 2006, management determined that the Developing Businesses ("DB") segment is not of continuing significance for financial reporting purposes. As a result, revenues and costs previously included in the DB segment and R&D expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 21, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K as "other" revenues and operating losses. 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fourth quarter 2006, certain product lines were transferred from the PCI segment to the Performance Polymers segment. During 2005 and 2004, these amounts were included within the PCI segment. Accordingly, the prior years amounts for sales and operating earnings have been adjusted to retrospectively apply these changes to all periods presented. CASPI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 $ % Sales $ 1,421 $ 1,299 $ 122 9 % Volume effect 6 % Price effect 115 9 % Product mix effect 4 % Exchange rate effect (3) % Operating earnings 229 228 1 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 13 4 9 Other operating income (2) 2 Sales revenue increased $122 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to an increase in selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings increased $1 million for 2006 compared to 2005 including increased asset impairments and restructuring charges. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $13 million for 2006 related to previously closed manufacturing facilities and severance related to a voluntary reduction in force. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $4 million for 2005 related primarily to previously closed manufacturing facilities. These charges are more fully described in Note 16, "Impairments and Restructuring Charges", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Excluding these items, operating earnings increased due to an increase in selling prices that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and favorable product mix that resulted from higher sales volume for specialty coatings. In November 2006, the Company sold the CASPI segments Epolene polymer businesses and related assets. CASPI sales revenue and operating earnings attributed to the divested businesses were $65 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2006. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 $ % Sales $ 910 $ 869 $ 41 5 % Volume effect 17 2 % Price effect 55 6 % Product mix effect (31) (3) % Exchange rate effect % Operating earnings 226 216 10 5 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 2 2 Sales revenue increased $41 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume that were partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs as well as continued strong demand for and limited supply of acetate yarn and acetyl chemical products. The increased sales volume and shift in product mix were due to strong demand for acetyl chemical products attributed to strengthened global acetate tow demand. Operating earnings for 2006 compared to 2005 increased $10 million as higher selling prices and increased sales volume more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $2 million in 2006 related primarily to severance due to a voluntary reduction in force. The Company believes that acetate tow has modest growth potential in future years and has been evaluating growth options in Europe and Asia. In the third quarter 2006, the Company announced plans to add capacity and expand production of Estron acetate tow in Europe at its Workington, England facility. The Company continues to evaluate options for growth in Asia. 42 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 $ % Sales $ 1,659 $ 1,560 $ 99 6 % Volume effect 1 % Price effect 118 7 % Product mix effect (19) (1) % Exchange rate effect (1) % Operating earnings 132 143 (11) (8) % Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 2 2 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 20 11 9 Other operating charges 7 7 Sales revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 increased $99 million primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly in the intermediates product lines, in response to increases in raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings for 2006 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $20 million primarily related to the divestiture of the PCI segments Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic chemicals product lines completed in the fourth quarter 2006 and to severance related to a voluntary reduction in force. The 2006 operating earnings also included $2 million of accelerated depreciation for cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility and $7 million of other operating charges related to the above mentioned divestiture. Excluding those items, operating earnings increased compared with 2005 as higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. PCI sales revenue and operating loss attributed to the divested product lines were $111 million and $15 million, respectively, for 2006. The 2005 operating earnings included $11 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges for previously impaired sites and $10 million of operating earnings from the achievement of certain milestones under an acetyls technology licensing agreement. In addition, as part of the transition agreement pertaining to the PE divestiture, the Company will supply ethylene to the buyer. The supply of ethylene to the buyer, which was formerly used internally, will be reported in the PCI segment. The Company also expects to begin a staged phase out of older cracking units in 2007, with timing dependent in part on market conditions. 43 Performance Polymers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 $ % Total sales $ 2,642 $ 2,586 $ 56 2 % Sales divested product lines 635 618 17 3 % Sales continuing product lines 2,007 1,968 39 2 % Volume effect 41 1 % Price effect 2 % Product mix effect 8 1 % Exchange rate effect 5 % Total operating earnings 54 176 (122) (69) % Operating earnings divested product lines (1) 136 75 61 81 % Operating earnings continuing product lines (82) 101 (183) &gt; (100)% Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 7 7 Accelerated depreciation divested product lines (1) Accelerated depreciation continuing product lines 7 7 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 46 46 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net divested product lines (1) Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net continuing product lines 46 46 Other operating income (75) (75) Other operating income divested product lines (1) (75) (75) Other operating income continuing product lines (1) Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company completed the divestiture of the Performance Polymer segments PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site and the Companys ethylene pipeline. Sales revenue increased $56 million for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher sales volume, particularly for PET polymers in Latin America, mostly offset by lower sales volume for PET polymers in North America attributed to lower industry capacity utilization rates. Excluding the divested product lines, sales revenue increased $39 million. 44 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating earnings decreased $122 million for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher and continued volatile raw material and energy costs, lower selling prices for PET polymers globally, increased asset impairments and restructuring charges and increased accelerated depreciation more than offsetting other operating income and increased sales volume. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $46 million for 2006 were primarily related to the shutdown of a research and development Kingsport, Tennessee pilot plant, discontinued production of cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM") modified polymers in San Roque, Spain and severance related to a reduction in force in the U.S. and Spain. CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET production, was discontinued in San Roque, Spain to gain operational efficiencies at other facilities. These charges are more fully described in Note 16, "Impairments and Restructuring Charges", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Accelerated depreciation of $7 million for 2006 related to previously disclosed restructuring decisions in association with cracking units in Longview, Texas, and higher cost PET polymer intermediates assets in Columbia, South Carolina, which are scheduled for shutdown. Other operating income for 2006 reflects a gain of $75 million on the above mentioned divestiture. Excluding the divested product lines, operating earnings decreased $183 million. Production began in November 2006 at the Companys new PET manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRex technology in Columbia, South Carolina. Manufacturing ParaStar next generation PET resins, the Company expects the facility to be at its full operational capacity of 350 thousand metric tons during the first quarter of 2007. The Company is evaluating the construction of a PET facility using the full IntegRex technology in the U.S. or elsewhere and utilizing further refinements to IntegRex technology. The Company is continuing to evaluate its strategic and operational options related to certain underperforming PET assets to improve profitability of the segment. In first quarter 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the San Roque, Spain manufacturing facility.

The increased sales volume was primarily attributed to continued market development efforts, particularly in copolyester product lines. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy costs with increases limited by competitive industry dynamics. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating earnings for 2006 declined $18 million compared with 2005 primarily due to asset impairment and restructuring charges, increased expenditures related to growth initiatives and higher raw material and energy costs slightly more than offsetting increased sales volume and higher selling prices. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $16 million in 2006 were related to the discontinued production of CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET production, in San Roque, Spain to gain operational efficiencies at other facilities. Accelerated depreciation of $1 million for 2006 related primarily to South Carolina operations.

The higher selling prices were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs. Sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly in the CASPI segment, and higher volumes particularly in the Performance Polymer segment. The higher selling prices were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volume and changes in mix. Higher selling prices, particularly in the Fibers segment, had a $76 million positive impact on sales revenue. Lower sales volume and negative mix, particularly for the Fibers segment, had a $61 million negative impact on sales revenue. Sales revenue in Latin America increased primarily due to higher sales volume, particularly in the Performance Polymers segment. With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars and euros. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For more information on these practices see Note 9 to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Sales $ 7,059 $ 6,580 7 % (7) % 15 % (1) % % Sales revenue for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to increased selling prices of approximately $1 billion throughout the Company that more than offset a decrease in volume resulting from divested businesses and product lines in 2004. The increase in selling prices was primarily in response to an increase in raw material and energy costs and the Companys efforts to improve profitability. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Gross Profit $ 1,404 $ 978 44 % As a percentage of sales 19.9 % 14.9 % Gross profit for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to the following factors: increased selling prices across all segments, primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs which increased more than $500 million; a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines; and cost reduction programs. The above items more than offset higher raw material and energy costs primarily attributable to paraxylene, propane, natural gas, coal and ethylene glycol. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 454 $ 450 1 % Research and Development Expenses 162 154 5 % $ 616 $ 604 2 % As a percentage of sales 8.7% 9.2% SG&A costs for 2005 increased slightly compared with 2004 due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense resulting from improved Company performance and higher bad debt expense, which more than offset decreases resulting from the previous divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI segment and the shutdown of operations at Cendian. R&D expenses for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to expenditures on growth initiatives in the SP segment and corporate R&D, which more than offset decreases resulting from the previous divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI segment. Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Impairments and restructuring charges totaled $33 million during 2005, consisting of non cash asset impairments of $12 million and restructuring charges of $21 million. During 2004, these charges totaled $206 million, consisting of non cash asset impairments of $140 million and restructuring charges of $66 million. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, see Note 16, "Impairments and Restructuring Charges", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Operating Income Other operating income of $2 million for 2005 included a $2 million gain associated with a change in estimates for contingencies related to the 2004 divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI segment. Other operating income of $7 million in 2004 resulted from the sale of Ariel Research Corporation ("Ariel"). Operating Earnings (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 Change Operating earnings $ 757 $ 175 $ &gt;100% Operating earnings for 2005 increased $582 million. Key factors in the improved results, aided by strong economic growth, were: increased selling prices throughout the Company of approximately $1 billion in response to increasing raw material and energy costs; lower asset impairment and restructuring charges of $33 million in 2005 compared to $206 million in 2004; completion of previously announced restructuring, divestiture and consolidation actions in 2004; a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines across the Companys portfolio of businesses, including acetyl, olefins, and polyester stream optimization; and continued cost reduction efforts. The above items more than offset an estimated $500 million increase in raw materials and energy costs and $33 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges.

Higher interest income for 2005 compared to 2004 reflected higher invested cash balances as well as higher average interest rates, resulting in lower net interest expense. Income from Equity Investment in Genencor Income from equity investment in Genencor includes the Companys portion of earnings from its equity investment in Genencor. In second quarter 2005, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in Genencor for net cash proceeds of approximately $417 million. The book value of the investment prior to sale was $246 million resulting in a pre tax gain on the sale of $171 million. 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Early Debt Extinguishment Costs In the second quarter 2005, the Company completed the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt for $544 million in cash and recorded a charge of $46 million for early debt extinguishment costs including $2 million in unamortized bond issuance costs. The book value of the purchased debt was $500 million.

Excluding discrete items, the effective tax rate would have been 35 percent. The 2004 effective tax rate was impacted by $90 million of deferred tax benefits resulting from the expected utilization of a capital loss resulting from the sale of certain businesses and product lines and related assets in the CASPI segment and $26 million of tax benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of a prior year capital loss refund claim. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2004 was impacted by the treatment of asset impairments and restructuring charges resulting in lower expected tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.

The decrease in sales revenue of $255 million was due to lower sales volume resulting from the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product lines within the segment. Sales revenue for continuing product lines increased $186 million, with selling prices positively impacting revenues 18 percent, driven by cyclical commodity products. The increase in operating earnings was the result of increased selling prices that more than offset higher raw material costs; lower asset impairment and restructuring charges; an increased focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, including the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product lines within the segment; improved gross profit margins, particularly for cyclical commodity product lines; and the impact of cost reduction efforts. Operating earnings for 2005 and 2004 were reduced by asset impairments and restructuring charges totaling approximately $4 million and $81 million, respectively. These charges are more fully described in Note 16, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Operating earnings for 2005 included $2 million of other operating income related to a change in estimates for contingencies associated with the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product lines within the segment. 50 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 $ % Sales $ 869 $ 731 $ 138 19 % Volume effect 51 7 % Price effect 76 11 % Product mix effect 10 1 % Exchange rate effect 1 % Operating earnings 216 155 61 39 % Sales revenue increased $138 million due to higher selling prices and increased sales volume. The higher sales volume was attributed to stronger demand for acetate tow, primarily in China, due to higher cigarette production volumes, a trend towards longer cigarette filters and substitution of acetate tow for polypropylene in cigarette filters. Demand for acetate tow in Eastern Europe increased due to increased cigarette production volumes. Market share for acetate yarn increased due to the exit of a major competitor from the acetate yarn market. Operating earnings increased due to higher sales volumes and increased selling prices that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. In 2005, a major global competitor exited the acetate filament yarn market. As a direct result, Eastman became the world leader in acetate yarn production, the only acetate yarn producer vertically integrated in acetate flake production, and the only acetate yarn producer in North America. The yarn market tightened significantly as the competitors yarn inventory was consumed in the world marketplace, and world prices for acetate yarn increased to profitable levels during late 2005.

Selling prices and sales volume were higher particularly in the intermediates product lines in response to significant increases in raw material and energy costs, an upturn in the olefins cycle, and improved market conditions in acetyl product lines. The sales volume increase was also attributed to long term arrangements with key customers and increased production capacity. 51 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The increase in operating earnings of $139 million was primarily due to increases in selling prices and ongoing cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings for 2005 included $10 million of operating earnings from the achievement of certain milestones under an acetyls technology licensing agreement. Operating earnings for 2005 also included $11 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges for previously impaired sites. Operating earnings for 2004 included $38 million in asset impairments related to assets at the Companys Batesville, Arkansas and Longview, Texas facilities, as well as severance charges.

In December 2006, the Company completed the sale of the Performance Polymer segments PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site and the Companys ethylene pipeline. The increase in sales revenue of $360 million was primarily due to increased selling prices, which had a positive impact of $424 million. The increased selling prices were mainly the result of efforts to offset higher raw material and energy costs. The lower sales volume was attributed to several factors: the effects of higher and volatile raw material and energy costs in North America due to the Gulf Coast hurricanes, including the impact of lower raw material costs for Asian producers of PET polymers to North America and customers working down inventories; and low PET polymers industry operating rates in Europe and Latin America due to a combination of lower than expected demand and overcapacity in southern and eastern Europe and Asian imports in South America. Excluding the divested product lines, sales revenue increased $253 million. Operating earnings increased as higher selling prices and reduced costs attributed to ongoing cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, resulting in improved margins, primarily in the PE markets and North American PET markets, prior to the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Operating earnings for 2004 were also reduced by asset impairments and restructuring charges of $13 million related to severance. Excluding the divested product lines, operating earnings increased $109 million. 52 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SP Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 $ % Sales $ 718 $ 644 $ 74 12 % Volume effect (2) % Price effect 75 12 % Product mix effect (1) % Exchange rate effect 2 % Operating earnings 64 13 51 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 53 (53) Sales revenue increased $74 million due to higher selling prices, which had a positive impact of $75 million. Despite higher sales volume for copolyester product lines, particularly for consumer and medical goods, overall sales volume declined primarily due to the lower sales volume of acetate used in photographic film. Operating earnings increased by $51 million compared to 2004 due to lower asset impairments and restructuring charges, higher selling prices, improved product mix, and ongoing cost reduction efforts partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs, and expenditures related to growth initiatives. Operating earnings for 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $53 million related primarily to the closure of the Hartlepool, United Kingdom manufacturing facility, as well as severance charges.

The higher selling prices mostly related to sales of PET polymers, PE, intermediates chemicals, and other cyclical commodity product lines and were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs and high industry wide capacity utilization. Lower overall sales volumes had a $208 million negative impact on sales revenue and were primarily due to the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, partially offset by significantly higher sales volumes in the PCI segment. The Cendian shutdown was reflected in product mix which had a $140 million negative impact on sales revenue. 53 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes, mainly the result of the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, which had a $224 million negative impact on sales revenue. Higher selling prices, particularly for PET polymers, had a $77 million positive impact on sales revenue. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher overall selling prices across all segments which had a $92 million positive impact on sales revenue. Higher sales volumes, particularly for the Fibers segment, had a $34 million positive impact on sales revenue. Sales revenue in Latin America increased primarily due to higher selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volume. Higher selling prices, particularly for PET polymers, had a $119 million positive impact on sales revenue. Lower sales volume, particularly for PET polymers and PE, had a $49 million negative impact on sales revenue. LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash Flows (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 609 $ 769 $ 494 Investing activities (94) (18) (148) Financing activities (101) (547) (579) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 (5) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 415 $ 199 $ (233) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 939 $ 524 $ 325 Cash provided by operating activities decreased $160 million in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements and a decrease in earnings, partially offset by lower current year cash contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In 2006, the Companys working capital requirements increased, primarily due to a higher mix of sales in Latin America and Europe, where customer credit terms are longer as compared to North America. The Company contributed $75 million and $165 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities increased $275 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily as a result of a significant increase in earnings and a decrease in working capital requirements, partially offset by $165 million in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The decrease in working capital requirements related primarily to accounts receivable, largely the result of improved collection performance which more than offset the increase in sales, partially offset by an increase in inventories. The Company made $3 million in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2004. Cash used in investing activities totaled $94 million and $18 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, the Company received $74 million in proceeds from the sale of its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and the specialty organic chemicals product lines and $235 million in proceeds from the sale of PE and Epolene polymer businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site and the Companys ethylene pipeline. For more information concerning divestitures, see Note 24, "Divestitures", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. In 2005, the Company received $417 million net cash proceeds from the sale of its equity investment in Genencor. Capital spending of $389 million and $343 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, included expenditures related to the construction of the new PET facility utilizing IntegRex technology. 54 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cash used in investing activities decreased $130 million in 2005 compared with 2004 largely due to $417 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Companys investment in Genencor in the second quarter 2005. In addition, in the second quarter 2005, the Company received payment for the $50 million note it received in the sale of certain businesses and product lines in the CASPI segment. In 2004, the Company received $115 million in net cash proceeds associated with such sale, as well as $12 million in proceeds from the sale of Ariel. In the fourth quarter 2005, the Company provided a line of credit up to $125 million to Primester, a joint venture in which Eastman has a 50 percent interest, which Primester fully utilized to repay its third party borrowings, which had previously been guaranteed by Eastman. In addition, the Company used an additional $95 million for additions to properties and equipment in 2005 as compared with 2004. Cash used in financing activities in 2006 totaled $101 million and included a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $50 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $83 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2005 totaled $547 million and included the Companys early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt, and a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $150 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $98 million. See Note 8, "Early Extinguishment of Debt", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K for information regarding the early extinguishment of debt. In addition, the Company borrowed $191 million from a new credit facility in the fourth quarter 2005, the proceeds of which provided a significant part of the funding for the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. Cash used in financing activities in 2004 totaled $579 million and reflects the January 2004 repayment of $500 million of 6 3/8% notes and a decrease in commercial paper, credit facility, and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $19 million, offset by cash from stock option exercises of $77 million. The payment of dividends is also reflected in financing activities in all periods. Liquidity At December 31, 2006, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and foreign banks totaling approximately $885 million. These credit facilities consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") expiring in April 2011, as well as a 140 million Euro credit facility ("Euro Facility") which expires in December 2011. Both credit facilities have options for two one year extensions, and the first extension option for the Euro Facility has been exercised. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. These credit facilities require facility fees on the total commitment that are based on Eastmans credit rating. In addition, these credit facilities contain a number of covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2006, the Companys credit facility borrowings totaled $185 million at an effective interest rate of 4.00 percent. At December 31, 2005, the Companys credit facility borrowings were $214 million at a weighted average interest rate of 3.01 percent. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since the Credit Facility expires in April 2011, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long term borrowings because the Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis. For more information regarding interest rates, see Note 7, "Borrowings", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company has effective shelf registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a combined $1.1 billion of debt or equity securities. In the second quarter 2005, Eastman completed the sale of its equity interest in Genencor for approximately $417 million in net cash proceeds after tax. This action, combined with strong operating results, allowed the Company to complete the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding debt in second quarter 2005, further strengthening its financial position. During 2006, the Company contributed $75 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In first quarter 2007, the Company completed a planned $100 million contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Cash flows from operations and the sources of capital described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However, the Companys cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastmans products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $389 million, $343 million, and $248 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increase of $46 million in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to spending on the expansion of CHDM capacity, as well as other growth initiatives. The Company expects that 2007 capital spending will be up to $450 million which will exceed estimated 2007 depreciation and amortization of approximately $350 million, including accelerated depreciation of $50 million. In 2007, the Company will continue to pursue projects including an acetate tow expansion in England, a copolyester intermediates expansion, make enhancements to benefit the PET facilities in South Carolina, utilizing IntegRex technology, and other growth initiatives. Other Commitments At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations related to notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.4 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 20 years. Other borrowings, related primarily to credit facility borrowings, totaled approximately $200 million. The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2006 totaling approximately $2.1 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month to month operating leases totaling approximately $200 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 12 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities and land; and approximately 38 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2006 totaling approximately $1.4 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other post employment obligations and environmental reserves. 56 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in Millions) Payments Due from Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities (a) Total 2007 $ $ 3 $ 107 $ 373 $ 45 $ 158 $ 686 2008 72 106 363 30 71 642 2009 13 106 349 25 67 560 2010 104 312 20 66 502 2011 2 185 104 199 17 61 568 2012 and beyond 1,317 1,052 507 64 955 3,895 Total $ 1,391 $ 201 $ 1,579 $ 2,103 $ 201 $ 1,378 $ 6,853 (a) Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post employment benefits in the periods indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Purchase obligations increased approximately $360 million at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 due primarily to increased raw material prices. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2006 totaled $113 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment. Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $2 million, $27 million, and $84 million will expire in 2007, 2008, and 2012, respectively. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. As described in Note 5, "Equity Investments and Other Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at the Companys Kingsport, Tennessee plant. During fourth quarter 2005, the Company provided a line of credit to the joint venture of up to $125 million, which Primester fully utilized to pay the principal amount of the joint ventures third party borrowings, previously guaranteed by Eastman. 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As described in Note 11, "Commitments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K, Eastman entered into an agreement in 1999 that allows it to generate cash by reducing its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third party. Under this agreement, receivables sold to the third party totaled $200 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Undivided interests in designated receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the purchased interest in the receivable pools. The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. The Company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees related to the third party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has concluded that the entities are not Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) or, in the case of Primester, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As such, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation Number 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In addition, the Company has evaluated long term purchase obligations with two entities that may be VIEs at December 31, 2006. These potential VIEs are joint ventures from which the Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and purchases approximately $60 million of raw materials and utilities on an annual basis. The Company has no equity interest in these entities and has confirmed that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the potential VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company has not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the entities are VIEs, and if one or both are VIEs, whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary. Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and non consolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur. Non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or liquidity. See Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K for off balance sheet post employment benefit obligations. Treasury Stock Transactions The Company was authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock. No shares of Eastman common stock were repurchased by the Company during 2006, 2005 or 2004 under a Company repurchase plan. A total of 2,746,869 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $112 million, or an average price of approximately $41 per share, have been repurchased under the authorization. Repurchased shares may be used to meet common stock requirements for compensation and benefit plans and other corporate purposes. On February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors cancelled its prior authorization for stock repurchases dated February 4, 1999 and approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. Repurchased shares may be used for such purposes or otherwise applied in such a manner as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. 58 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Dividends The Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share for a total of $1.76 per share in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Preferred Stock Purchase Rights During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company redeemed all of the outstanding preferred stock purchase rights issuable pursuant to the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement and terminated the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement. The payment of $0.01 per share of common stock was made January 2, 2007. ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Adequate reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastmans policies as described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Companys preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $18 million to the maximum of $32 million at December 31, 2006. In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" (" FIN 47"), which was effective for the Company on December 31, 2005. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation also clarifies that the term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation ("CARO") refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company performed a thorough examination of various asset categories. Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately 60 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2006. Currently, the Companys environmental assets are expected to be no longer useable at different times over the next 50 years. If the Company were to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastmans costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market price fluctuations. For additional information see Note 9, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." SFAS No. 155 simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments under SFAS No. 133 by permitting fair value remeasurement for financial instruments containing an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 eliminates both the previous restriction under SFAS No. 140 on passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity may hold and SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, which provides that beneficial interests are not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, and clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not imbedded derivatives. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS No. 155 and determined that it does not expect a material impact from the adoption to its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results from operations. 60 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 156 permits entities to choose to either subsequently measure servicing rights at fair value and report changes in fair value in earnings or amortize servicing rights in proportion to and over the estimated net servicing income or loss and assess to rights for impairment or the need for an increased obligation. SFAS No. 156 also clarifies when a servicer should separately recognize servicing assets and liabilities; requires all separately recognized assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable; permits a one time reclassification of available for sales securities to trading securities by an entity with recognized servicing rights and requires additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS No. 156 and determined that it does not expect a material impact from the adoption to its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results from operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes". FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under FIN 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts, but without considering time values. FIN 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive, annual, tabular roll forward of the unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which addresses the measurement of fair value by companies when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP. SFAS No. 157 provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP which is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for an entitys financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position No. AUG AIR 1 ("FSP No. AUG AIR 1") which addresses the accounting for planned major maintenance activities. FSP No. AUG AIR 1 amends certain provisions in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Industry Audit Guide and APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting". Four alternative methods of accounting for planned major maintenance activities were permitted: direct expense, built in overhaul, deferral, and accrual ("accrue in advance"). This FSP prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities because it results in the recognition of a liability in a period prior to the occurrence of the transaction or event obligating the entity. FSP No. AUG AIR 1 is effective for an entitys financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not utilize the accrue in advance method of accounting and therefore expects this FSP to have no impact on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. In February, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115." SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Upon adoption, an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Most of the provisions apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. SFAS No. 159 will be effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS No. 159 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. 61 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OUTLOOK For 2007, the Company expects: strong volumes will be maintained due to continued economic strength, continued substitution of Eastman products for other materials, and new applications for existing products; the volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit; a staged phase out of older cracking units and a planned shutdown of higher cost PET assets in South Carolina will continue in 2007, resulting in accelerated depreciation in 2007 of approximately $50 million; to increase volumes in the PCI segment due to the transition agreement pertaining to the polyethylene divestiture; the Company will supply ethylene to the buyer, allowing both companies to optimize the value of their respective olefin businesses under various market conditions; to contribute $100 million to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan, all of which was contributed in the first quarter of 2007; net interest expense to decrease compared with 2006 primarily due to higher interest income, driven by higher invested cash balances; the effective tax rate to be approximately 35 percent; that acetate tow will have modest growth potential in future years and; therefore, expects to continue to evaluate growth options in Asia; to aggressively take action to improve the performance of its PET product lines in the Performance Polymers segment, including starting up the Companys new PET facility utilizing IntegRex technology in Columbia, South Carolina, debottlenecking the new PET facility utilizing IntegRex technology for an additional 100 thousand metric tons of capacity, rationalizing 350 thousand metric tons of existing capacity in North America, entering into an agreement to sell the Spain PET manufacturing facility, and considering other strategic options for its underperforming PET manufacturing facilities outside the United States, which may lead to further restructuring and asset impairment charges; capital expenditures to increase to up to $450 million and exceed estimated depreciation and amortization of approximately $350 million, including accelerated depreciation of $50 million; in 2007, the Company plans to pursue expansion of acetate tow and copolyester intermediates, make enhancements to benefit the PET facilities in South Carolina, utilizing IntegRex technology, and pursue growth initiatives; and priorities for use of available cash will be to pay the quarterly cash dividend, fund targeted growth initiatives and defined benefit pension plans, and repurchase shares. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. 62 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K may be forward looking in nature as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman Chemical Company; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; integration of acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described in this report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements: The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. There can be no assurance, however, that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. In addition, natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials and energy commodities, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities, could affect availability and costs of raw materials and energy commodities. While temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability and price are impacted by natural disasters, plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market and political conditions, changes in government regulation, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure. Eastmans operations or products may, at times, be adversely affected by these factors. 63 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys competitive position in the markets in which it participates is, in part, subject to external factors in addition to those that the Company can impact. Natural disasters, pandemic illnesses, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw materials and energy supplies to the Company and for delivery of the Companys products to customers, could negatively impact the Companys competitive position and its ability to maintain market share. For example, supply and demand for certain of the Companys products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of the Companys products. Limitation of the Companys available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations, including natural disasters, pandemic illnesses, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw materials and energy supplies to the Company and for delivery of the Companys products to customers, could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue, costs and results of operations and financial condition. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of the largest customers could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. The Companys competitive position has recently been adversely impacted by low cost competitors in certain regions and customers developing internal or alternative sources of supply. The Company has efforts underway to exploit growth opportunities in certain core businesses by developing new products and technologies, expanding into new markets, and tailoring product offerings to customer needs. Current examples include IntegRex technology and new PET polymers products and copolyester product innovations There can be no assurance that such efforts will result in financially successful commercialization of such products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor. The Company has made, and intends to continue making, strategic investments, including IntegRex technology and coal gasification, and has entered, and expects to continue to enter, into strategic alliances in technology, services businesses, and other ventures in order to build, diversify, and strengthen certain Eastman capabilities, improve Eastmans raw materials and energy cost and supply position, and maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets. There can be no assurance that such investments and alliances will achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Companys results of operations or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor. In addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives, the Company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases where warranted and accepted by the market; however, the companys earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized, not be sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs, or have a negative impact on demand and volume. There can be no assurances that price increases will be realized or will be realized within the companys anticipated timeframe. 64 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company has undertaken and expects to continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. The Companys facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future. The Companys accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. The Company and its operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating losses. The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Companys ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. Due to the Companys global sales, earnings, and asset profile, it is exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including swaps, options and forwards, to mitigate the impact of changes in exchange rates and interest rates on its financial results. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful and operating results could be affected by significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates. The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and elsewhere from time to time, represents managements best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects. 65 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations. To mitigate the Companys exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis, which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities, which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. Currently, these borrowings are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent absolute shift in interest rates. For 2006 and 2005, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of 1 percent were approximately $126 million and $134 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates. The Companys operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. For 2006, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $20 million and an additional $2.0 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy. To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane and natural gas, the Company enters into forwards and options contracts. For 2006 and 2005, the market risks associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent were $6 million and $2 million, respectively, and an additional $0.5 million for each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter for both periods. 66
