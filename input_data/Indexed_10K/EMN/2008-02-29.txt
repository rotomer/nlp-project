All references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. During second quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of its polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") manufacturing facility in Spain. In fourth quarter 2007, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its PET polymers and purified terephthalic acid ("PTA") manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands and its PET manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom and the related businesses. Because the Company is exiting the PET business in the European region, results related to sales of PET products manufactured at the Spain, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom sites are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under GAAP. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Also in 2007, the Company sold its Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing sites. Sales from these sites are not presented as discontinued operations due to the Performance Polymers segments continuing involvement in the Latin America region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. 32 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Companys management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to impaired assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Companys management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Companys financial condition and results. These estimates require managements most significant judgments in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used, significant changes in business conditions, or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset. For long lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or an appraisal. For long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing. As the Companys assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change, additional write downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recognized fixed (tangible) asset impairment costs of $120 million and definite lived intangible asset impairment costs of $2 million in results from continuing operations during 2007. The Company recognized fixed (tangible) asset impairment costs of $61 million and definite lived intangible asset impairment costs of $1 million in results from continuing operations during 2006. 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $13 million to the maximum of $17 million at December 31, 2007. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as defined in SFAS No. 143, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years. If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease. In accordance with Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ("FIN 47"), the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The Companys reserve for environmental contingencies was $42 million at December 31, 2007 and $47 million at December 31, 2006, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs. United States Pension and Other Post employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets. At December 31, 2007, the Company assumed a discount rate of 6.16 percent on its defined benefit pension plan, 6.21 percent on its other post employment benefit plan and an expected return on assets of 9 percent. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. 34 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for U.S. pension plan and other postretirement welfare plans: Change in Assumption Impact on 2008 Pre tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2007 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plan Impact on December 31, 2007 Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5 Million +$41 Million +$20 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5 Million $39 Million $19 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$3 Million No Impact N/A 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $3 Million No Impact N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Companys pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, and private equities markets. The actual return on assets has exceeded the expected return for the last 5 years. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations. As future benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2007, 2006, and 2005 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $47 million, $54 million, and $56 million, respectively. The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2008. However, an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, as of December 31, 2008 for the impact on the pensions projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations, see Note 11, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against earnings in particular periods. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2007, a valuation allowance of $146 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. STRATEGIC ACTIONS AND RELATED PRESENTATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES During 2007, the Company took strategic actions in its Performance Polymers segment to address its underperforming PET manufacturing facilities outside the United States. In second quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of its PET manufacturing facility in Spain. In fourth quarter 2007, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its PET polymers and PTA manufacturing facility in the Netherlands and the PET manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom and related businesses. Because the Company is exiting the PET manufacturing business in the European region, results from the sales of PET products manufactured at the Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom manufacturing sites are presented as discontinued operations and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under GAAP. Also in 2007, the Company sold its Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing sites. Sales from these sites are not presented as discontinued operations due to the Performance Polymers segments continuing involvement in the Latin America region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. In order to provide a better understanding of the impact on Performance Polymers segment results of the Latin American PET assets, this Managements Discussion and Analysis includes certain financial measures with and without sales and operating results in Latin America from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina.. For more information on discontinued operations, refer to Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Asset impairments and restructuring charges resulting from these actions were $15 million net of tax for the Spain divestiture reported in discontinued operations and $115 million before tax for the Latin American manufacturing sites reported in continuing operations in 2007. 36 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fourth quarter 2006, the Company sold its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets in the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment and its polyethylene ("PE") and EpoleneTM polymer businesses and related assets of the Performance Polymers and Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers, and Inks ("CASPI") segments. For 2006, sales revenue of $811 million and operating earnings of $124 million were attributed to these divested product lines. Asset impairments and restructuring charges from the divested Arkansas manufacturing facility were $18 million in 2006. Other operating (income) charges, net were a charge of $7 million from the divestiture of the Arkansas manufacturing facility and income of $75 million from the divestiture of the PE and EpoleneTM polymer product lines. As part of the PE divestiture, the Company entered into a transition agreement for contract ethylene sales, sales revenue and operating earnings from which are included in PCI segment results in 2007. Also in the fourth quarter 2006, the Company made strategic decisions relating to the scheduled shutdown of cracking units in Longview, Texas and a planned shutdown of higher cost PET assets in Columbia, South Carolina. Accelerated depreciation costs resulting from these decisions were $49 million and $10 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. For more information on accelerated depreciation, refer to "Gross Profit" in the "Results of Operations" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. This Managements Discussion and Analysis includes the following non GAAP financial measures and accompanying reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures: Company sales and segment sales and results from continuing operations excluding sales revenue and results from continuing operations from sales in Latin America of PET products manufactured at the divested Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing sites; Company and segment sales excluding contract ethylene sales under a transition agreement related to the PE product lines divested in 2006; Company sales and segment sales and results from continuing operations excluding sales revenue and operating results from the product lines divested in 2006; and Company and segment gross profit, operating earnings, and net earnings excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), and other operating (income) loss, net. Eastmans management believes that contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement related to the divestiture of the PE product lines do not reflect the continuing and expected future business of the PCI segment. In addition, for evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and of the impact on the Company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs and to improve the profitability of the Company, management believes that Company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with and without accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, and other operating (income) loss, and that Company and segment sales and results from continuing operations should be considered both with and without sales revenue and results from continuing operations from divested product lines and from sales in Latin America of PET products manufactured at the divested Mexico and Argentina manufacturing facilities. Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported Company and segment results, respectively, without the identified items. Management utilizes Company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance based compensation. These measures, excluding the identified items, are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance. 2007 OVERVIEW The Companys sales revenue was $6.8 billion for both full year 2007 and 2006. Excluding contract ethylene sales and sales from divested PET facilities in Mexico and Argentina for both periods and sales from the divested PE product line for 2006, sales revenue increased 11 percent in 2007. 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The strategic decisions and actions described above resulted in accelerated depreciation costs of $49 million and asset impairments and restructuring charges of $112 million in 2007 and accelerated depreciation costs of $10 million, asset impairments and restructuring charges of $101 million, and other operating income of $68 million in 2006. Operating earnings were $504 million in 2007, a $150 million decrease compared with 2006. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating income, operating earnings were $665 million in 2007 compared with $697 million in 2006. Earnings from continuing operations were $321 million for 2007 compared with $427 million for 2006. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating income, earnings from continuing operations were $423 million and $434 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Companys broad base of businesses continues to achieve strong financial results, with the decline in earnings primarily due to the operating loss in the Performance Polymers segment. The Company generated $732 million in cash from operating activities during 2007 compared to $609 million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to a reduction in working capital. During 2007, the Company reduced working capital $86 million primarily related to reductions in inventories. The Company contributed $100 million and $75 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company does not plan to make additional contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2008. Priorities for use of available cash are paying the quarterly cash dividend, funding targeted growth initiatives, and repurchasing shares. In 2007, the Company repurchased shares for a total of $382 million at an average price of $64 per share. In addition to achieving the above results, Eastman continued to progress on its overall growth objectives including the announcement in July 2007 of two industrial gasification projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and actions to improve the performance of its Performance Polymers segment. The gasification project announcements are an important milestone in the Companys continuing efforts to leverage its technology and operational expertise for future growth. In October 2007, the Company announced it has entered into an agreement with Green Rock Energy, L.L.C. ("Green Rock"), a company formed by the D. E. Shaw Group and Goldman, Sachs & Co., to jointly develop the approximately $1.6 billion industrial gasification facility in Beaumont, Texas. The Beaumont, Texas project is expected to be operational in 2011 and will produce hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia. The Company will be an investor, developer, service provider, and customer for this project. The Company also announced an agreement with Green Rock to invest in its St. James Parish, Louisiana project. This project is expected to be operational in 2011 and will produce anhydrous ammonia and methanol. The Company will be an investor, service provider and customer for this project. In addition to the Performance Polymers divestitures described under "Strategic Actions and Related Presentation of Non GAAP Financial Measures", in 2007 the Company started up the new 350,000 metric ton PET facility using IntegRexTM technology in Columbia, South Carolina, which was fully operational in the first quarter of 2007. ParaStarTM PET resins, enabled by IntegRexTM technology, were widely accepted in the marketplace during 2007. The Company plans to increase capacity at this facility to over 525,000 metric tons of ParaStarTM next generation PET resins by the end of 2008 and to reduce the annual costs at this facility by $30 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations as presented in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K are summarized and analyzed below. 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As a result of the Companys strategic actions in the Performance Polymers segment, the discussion below reflects results from continuing operations. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Sales $ 6,830 $ 6,779 1 % (3) % 3 % % 1 % Sales contract ethylene sales (1) 314 27 Sales 2006 divested product lines (2) 811 Sales sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities (3) 413 440 Sales excluding listed items $ 6,103 $ 5,501 11 % 5 % 4 % 1 % 1 % (1) Included in 2007 and 2006 sales revenue are contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses. (2) Included in 2006 sales revenue are sales revenue from sales of products of the divested product lines of the Companys Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets in the PCI segment and of the divested PE and EpoleneTM polymer businesses and related assets of the Performance Polymers and CASPI segments. (3) Included in 2007 and 2006 sales revenue are sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina divested in the fourth quarter 2007. These sales are not considered discontinued operations due to continuing involvement in the Latin America region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. Sales revenue for 2007 compared to 2006 increased $51 million. Excluding contract ethylene sales, sales from 2006 divested product lines, and sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities, sales revenue increased 11 percent primarily due to higher sales volume, particularly in the Performance Polymers and PCI segments, and higher selling prices in all segments except the Performance Polymers segment in response to higher raw material and energy costs. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Gross Profit $ 1,192 $ 1,265 (6) % As a percentage of sales 17.5 % 18.7 % Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 49 10 Gross Profit excluding accelerated depreciation costs 1,241 1,275 (3) % As a percentage of sales 18.2 % 18.8 % 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales for 2007 decreased compared with 2006 primarily due to higher raw materials and energy costs more than offsetting higher selling prices. Gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were also impacted by accelerated depreciation costs resulting from the scheduled shutdown of cracking units in Longview, Texas and of higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. In 2007, raw material and energy costs increased by approximately $250 million over the prior year, compared to increases in selling prices of approximately $200 million. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") $ 420 $ 423 (1) % Research and Development Expenses ("R&D") 156 155 % $ 576 $ 578 % As a percentage of sales 8.4% 8.5% SG&A expenses in 2007 decreased compared to 2006 primarily as a result of the manufacturing sites, businesses, and product lines divested in 2007 and 2006 partially offset by increased spending on growth initiatives. For additional information refer to Note 17, "Divestitures" to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. R&D expenses for 2007 were flat compared to 2006 as decreased expenses in Performance Polymers resulting from the fourth quarter 2006 completion of the Companys new PET manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology in Columbia, South Carolina were offset by increased spending on the industrial gasification initiatives and on growth projects in the Specialty Plastics ("SP") segment. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $112 million and $101 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2007 were primarily costs associated with the PET manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Argentina sold in the fourth quarter 2007. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2006 were primarily severance charges for work force reductions and impairments resulting from the shutdown of an R&D pilot plant and the shutdown of the cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM") manufacturing assets in San Roque, Spain. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, primarily related to recent strategic decisions and actions, see the Performance Polymers segment discussion and Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income, net for 2006 reflects a gain of $75 million on the sale of the Companys PE and EpoleneTM polymer businesses, related assets, and the Companys ethylene pipeline and a charge of approximately $7 million related to the sale of the Companys Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and its related assets and product lines. For more information concerning divestitures, see Note 17, "Divestitures", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Earnings 2007 2006 Change (Dollars in millions) Operating earnings $ 504 $ 654 (23) % Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 49 10 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 112 101 Other operating income, net (68) Operating earnings excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairment and restructuring charges, net, and other operating income, net $ 665 $ 697 (5) % Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Gross interest costs $ 113 $ 109 Less: capitalized interest 10 7 Interest expense 103 102 1 % Interest income 41 25 Interest expense, net $ 62 $ 77 (19) % Gross interest costs for 2007 compared to 2006 were higher due to higher average interest rates. Higher capitalized interest is due to higher levels of capital expenditures. Higher interest income for 2007 compared to 2006 reflected higher invested cash balances, as well as higher average interest rates, resulting in lower net interest expense. For 2008, the Company expects net interest expense to increase compared with 2007 primarily due to lower interest income, driven by declining interest rates. Other (Income) Charges, Net (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Other income $ (33) $ (25) $ (8) Other charges 5 8 (3) Other (income) charges, net $ (28) $ (17) $ (11) Included in other (income) charges, net are the Companys portion of net earnings from its equity investments, gains on the sale of certain technology business venture investments, royalty income, net gains on foreign exchange transactions, and other non operating income related to Holston Defense Corporation ("HDC"). Included in other charges are net losses on foreign exchange transactions, the Companys portion of losses from its equity investments, write downs to fair value of certain technology business venture investments due to other than temporary declines in value, and fees on securitized receivables. Included in 2007 other income is $11 million of income from investments and $7 million in net gains on foreign exchange transactions. Other income for 2007 and 2006 included gains of $4 million and $12 million, respectively, resulting from a favorable decision of the U.S. Department of the Army to reimburse post employment benefits being provided to retirees of HDC, a wholly owned subsidiary. This gain reflected a portion of the unrecognized gain resulting from the reimbursement decision that will be amortized into earnings over future periods. For additional information, see Note 11, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Provision for Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Provision for income taxes $ 149 $ 167 (11) % Effective tax rate 32 % 28 % The 2007 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported earnings from continuing operations before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 33 percent. The 2006 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported earnings from continuing operations before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 31 percent. The effective tax rate was impacted by $25 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of capital loss carryforward valuation reserves and $11 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of foreign net operating loss valuation reserves. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 34 percent. Earnings from Continuing Operations (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Earnings from continuing operations $ 321 $ 427 Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold, net of tax 31 6 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net of tax 71 69 Other operating income, net (68) Earnings from continuing operations excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net of tax, and other operating income, net $ 423 $ 434 Net Earnings (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Earnings from continuing operations $ 321 $ 427 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (10) (18) Loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax (11) Net earnings $ 300 $ 409 The loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax of $11 million is from the sale of the Companys San Roque, Spain PET manufacturing facility in the Performance Polymers segment. Net proceeds from the sale of the San Roque site were approximately $43 million. During 2007, the Company also recognized site closure costs of $4 million, net of tax, for the San Roque PET site. For additional information on discontinued operations, see to Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 42 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are managed and reported in five reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the PCI segment, the Performance Polymers, segment and the SP segment. For additional information concerning the Companys operating businesses and products, refer to Note 23, "Segment Information", to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Sales revenue and expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 23, "Segment Information", as "other" sales revenue and operating losses. CASPI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 $ % Sales $ 1,451 $ 1,421 $ 30 2 % Volume effect (68) (5) % Price effect 48 3 % Product mix effect 26 2 % Exchange rate effect 24 2 % Operating earnings 235 229 6 3 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net (1) 13 (14) Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 234 242 (8) (3) % Sales revenue for 2007 increased $30 million compared to 2006 as higher selling prices, a favorable shift in product mix, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by lower sales volume. Selling prices increased in response to higher raw material and energy costs. The lower sales volume was primarily attributed to the divestiture of the Companys EpoleneTM product lines in fourth quarter 2006 and slightly lower sales volume for coatings product lines in North America. Operating earnings for 2007 increased $6 million compared to 2006. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, operating earnings decreased $8 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in operating earnings is primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily in the coatings product lines, partially offset by higher selling prices, a favorable shift in product mix, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2006 were related to previously closed manufacturing facilities and severance costs related to a voluntary reduction in force. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 $ % Sales $ 999 $ 910 $ 89 10 % Volume effect 25 3 % Price effect 51 6 % Product mix effect 9 1 % Exchange rate effect 4 % Operating earnings 238 226 12 5 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 2 (2) Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 238 228 10 4 % Sales revenue for 2007 increased $89 million compared to 2006 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. Selling prices increased primarily due to efforts to offset higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp. The increased sales volume was attributed to continued industry market growth in acetate tow product lines and competitor outages. Operating earnings for 2007 increased $12 million compared to 2006 due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $2 million in 2006 primarily related to severance costs of a voluntary reduction in force. 44 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 $ % Sales $ 2,095 $ 1,659 $ 436 26 % Volume effect 401 24 % Price effect 74 4 % Product mix effect (49) (3) % Exchange rate effect 10 1 % Sales contract ethylene sales (1) 314 27 287 Sales divested product lines (2) 111 (111) Sales excluding listed items 1,781 1,521 260 17 % Volume effect 131 9 % Price effect 98 6 % Product mix effect 22 1 % Exchange rate effect 9 1 % Operating earnings 220 132 88 67 % Operating earnings (loss) divested product lines (2)(3) (15) 15 100 % Operating earnings excluding divested product lines (3) 220 147 73 50 % Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) 238 161 77 48 % Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) divested product lines (2)(3) 3 (3) (100)% Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) excluding divested product lines (3) 238 158 80 51 % (1) Sales revenue for 2007 and 2006 included contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses. (2) Sales revenue and operating results for 2006 included sales revenue from sales of products of the divested product lines of the Companys Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic chemicals product lines. (3) Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (4) Items are accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) and other operating charges. Accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring gains for 2007 were $19 million and $1 million, respectively. Accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, and other operating charges for 2006 were $2 million, $20 million, and $7 million, respectively. The accelerated depreciation costs are related to the continuation of the planned staged phase out of older cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility. Asset impairments and restructuring charges were primarily related to the divestiture of the PCI segments Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic chemicals product lines completed in the fourth quarter 2006 and to severance costs related to a voluntary reduction in force in 2006. The other operating charges resulted from the Batesville, Arkansas divestiture. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales revenue for 2007 increased $436 million compared to 2006 primarily due to contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement resulting from the divestiture of the Performance Polymers segments PE business in the fourth quarter 2006. Excluding the contract ethylene sales and sales revenue from divested product lines, sales revenue for 2007 increased due to higher sales volume and increased selling prices, which were attributed to favorable market conditions, primarily for olefin based derivative products and acetyl chemicals in Asia Pacific and the United States, and competitor outages. Operating earnings increased $88 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairment and restructuring charges (gains), and other operating charges, operating earnings increased $77 million. The increase is due to higher sales volume, higher selling prices, and earnings from the licensing of acetyl technology, with contract ethylene sales having minimal impact on operating earnings for 2007 compared to 2006. Selling prices increased in response to higher raw material and energy costs. The accelerated depreciation costs are related to the continuation of the planned staged phase out of older cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility. The Company evaluates licensing opportunities for acetic acid and oxo derivatives on a selective basis, and has licensed technology for two projects to produce acetyl products one to Saudi International Petrochemical Company ("SipChem") in Saudi Arabia in 2005, and a second to Chang Chung Petrochemical Company in Taiwan in 2007. In the fourth quarter 2006 the Company completed its divestiture of the PCI segments Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic chemicals product lines. Sales revenue and operating loss attributed to the divested product lines were $111 million and $15 million, respectively for 2006. 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Performance Polymers Segment As a result of the Companys strategic actions in the Performance Polymers segment, the financial discussion below is of results from continuing operations in all periods presented. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K.

(2) Sales revenue and operating results for 2007 and 2006 include sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina divested in fourth quarter 2007. These sales are not presented as discontinued operations due to the Performance Polymers segments continuing involvement in the Latin American region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. (3) Includes allocated costs not included in discontinued operations, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (4) Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Performance Polymers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 $ % Operating earnings (loss) excluding certain items (1)(2) $ (65) $ 46 $ (111) &gt;(100) % Operating earnings excluding certain items (3) divested PE product line (4) 61 (61) &gt;(100) % Operating loss excluding certain items (5) from sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities (6) (12) (12) % Operating loss excluding certain items (7) U.S. PET manufacturing facilities (1) (53) (3) (50) &gt;(100) % (1) Includes allocated costs not included in discontinued operations, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (2) Items are accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net and other operating income. In 2007, asset impairments and restructuring charges of $113 million primarily related to the Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities sale. Accelerated depreciation costs of $29 million resulted from restructuring actions associated with higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. In 2006, asset impairments and restructuring charges of $46 million were primarily related to the shutdown of a research and development Kingsport, Tennessee pilot plant, discontinued production of CHDM modified polymers in San Roque, Spain and severance costs from a reduction in force in the U.S. and Spain. CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET production, was discontinued in San Roque, Spain to gain operational efficiencies at other facilities. Accelerated depreciation of $7 million in 2006 related to the restructuring decisions and actions for higher cost PET polymer intermediates assets in Columbia. Other operating income was $75 million in 2006 from the divestiture of the PE businesses and assets. (3) Items are other operating income from the sale of the PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site which were sold in fourth quarter 2006, and which were $75 million in 2006. (4) PE product lines of the PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site which were sold in fourth quarter 2006. Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (5) Items are asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) relating to the Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities, and were $115 million in 2007. (6) Sales revenue and operating results for 2007 and 2006 include sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina divested in fourth quarter 2007. These sales are not presented as discontinued operations due to the Performance Polymers segments continuing involvement in the Latin American region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (7) Items are accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) related to the U.S. PET manufacturing facilities. Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) were $(2) million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accelerated depreciation costs were $29 million and $7 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales revenue decreased $558 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the divested PE product lines. For U.S. PET manufacturing facilities, sales revenue increased $104 million primarily due to the increased North America sales volumes attributed to increased capacity from the Companys ParaStarTM PET facility based on IntegRexTM technology. 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Excluding operating losses from sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities of $127 million and $12 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and operating earnings from the divested PE product lines of $136 million in 2006, operating results decreased $24 million for 2007 compared to 2006. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation costs, operating results from U.S. manufacturing facilities decreased $50 million due to costs associated with the new PET facility based on IntegRexTM technology becoming fully operational and the timing of the commercial launch of ParaStarTM PET produced in the IntegRexTM technology facility as well as higher and continued volatile raw material and energy costs resulting in compressed gross margins, particularly in North America. Production began in November 2006 at the Companys new PET manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology in Columbia, South Carolina. Manufacturing ParaStarTM next generation PET resins, the 350,000 metric tons facility was fully operational in first quarter of 2007. The Company plans to increase capacity at this facility to over 525,000 metric tons of ParaStarTM next generation PET resins by the end of 2008 and to reduce annual costs at this facility by $30 million. During the fourth quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of Eastmans PET polymers production facilities in Mexico and Argentina and the related businesses. Sales revenue attributed to PET product manufactured at the Mexico and Argentina PET sites for 2007 and 2006 was $413 million and $440 million, respectively.

Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material, energy, and transportation costs. The increased sales volume was primarily attributed to continued market development efforts, particularly in copolyester and cellulose esters product lines, which more than offset a decline in demand for polyester products used in photographic and optical films. 49 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating earnings increased $19 million. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation costs, operating earnings for 2007 increased compared to 2006 as higher selling prices and favorable foreign currency exchange rates more than offset increased raw material and energy costs and increased expenditures related to growth initiatives. The 2007 operating earnings included $1 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges primarily for the Spain CHDM facility and $1 million of accelerated depreciation costs from restructuring actions for higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. The 2006 operating results included $16 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges related to the discontinued production of CHDM and $1 million of accelerated depreciation costs from restructuring actions for higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 4,043 $ 4,221 (4) % (4) % 2 % (2) % % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 932 816 14 % 3 % 3 % 2 % 6 % Asia Pacific 1,103 941 17 % 3 % 8 % 6 % % Latin America 752 801 (6) % (8) % 2 % % % $ 6,830 $ 6,779 1 % (3) % 3 % % 1 % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada decreased primarily due to lower volumes particularly in the CASPI and Performance Polymers segments due to the divestitures in those segments, partially offset by higher volumes in the PCI segment due to the contract ethylene sales. Sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased due to the effect of the foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in the CASPI and SP segments, higher selling prices, particularly in the Fibers and SP segments, and higher volumes, particularly in the SP and Fibers segments. The higher selling prices were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher selling prices and a favorable shift in product mix, primarily in the PCI segment. Product mix was positively impacted by $20 million from technology licensing in the PCI segment. Sales revenue in Latin America decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, particularly in the Performance Polymers segment. Excluding divested product lines and manufacturing facilities, sales revenue was flat. During the fourth quarter 2007, the Company sold its PET polymers production facilities in Mexico and Argentina and the related businesses, which will result in significantly lower sales revenue in Latin America in future periods. However, subject to certain product specific agreements associated with the sale of the manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Argentina, the Company plans to continue to sell a limited set of PET products manufactured in the U.S. in certain Latin American markets. 50 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars and euros. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For more information on these practices see Note 10, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."

(2) Included in 2006 and 2005 sales revenue are sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina divested in fourth quarter 2007. These sales are not considered discontinued operations due to continuing involvement in the Latin America region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. Sales revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 increased $319 million. Excluding sales from divested product lines and sales from the Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities, sales revenue increased 5 percent primarily due to higher selling prices in response to both higher raw material and energy costs and continued strong economic conditions. 51 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Gross Profit $ 1,265 $ 1,360 (7) % As a percentage of sales 18.7 % 21.1 % Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 10 Gross Profit excluding accelerated depreciation costs 1,275 1,360 (6) % As a percentage of sales 18.8 % 21.1 % Gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales for 2006 decreased, particularly in the Performance Polymers segment, compared with 2005 primarily due to increased raw material and energy costs and operational disruptions that were partially offset by higher selling prices. In 2006, raw material and energy costs increased by approximately $400 million compared to the prior year, compared to a selling price increase of $323 million. In addition, 2006 included $10 million of accelerated depreciation costs resulting from the scheduled shutdown of cracking units in Longview, Texas and of higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change SG&A Expenses $ 423 $ 439 (4) % R&D Expenses 155 150 (3) % $ 578 $ 589 (2) % As a percentage of sales 8.5% 9.1% SG&A expenses in 2006 decreased compared to 2005 primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense in 2006, which included compensation expense recorded under SFAS No. 123 Revised December 2004 ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), "Share Based Payment". For more information concerning SFAS No. 123(R), see Note 16, "Share Based Compensation Plans and Awards", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. R&D expenses for 2006 increased compared with 2005 primarily due to increased spending on growth initiatives, particularly in the SP segment, which more than offset decreased expenses in the Performance Polymers segment related to the IntegRexTM technology. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $101 million and $33 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2006 were primarily severance charges for work force reductions and impairments resulting from the shutdown of an R&D pilot plant and the shutdown of the CHDM manufacturing assets in San Roque, Spain. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2005 were primarily related to the shutdown of Cendian Corporation, the Companys logistics subsidiary and fixed asset impairments related to the Companys PCI manufacturing facilities outside the United States. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, see Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 52 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income, net for 2006 reflects a gain of $75 million on the sale of the Companys PE and EpoleneTM polymer businesses, related assets, and the Companys ethylene pipeline and charges of approximately $7 million related to the sale of the Companys Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and its related assets and product lines. For more information concerning divestitures, see Note 17, "Divestitures", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Higher interest income for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected higher invested cash balances as well as higher average interest rates, resulting in lower net interest expense. Income from Equity Investment in Genencor For 2005, income from equity investment in Genencor International, Inc. ("Genencor") includes the Companys portion of earnings from its equity investment in Genencor. In second quarter 2005, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in Genencor for net cash proceeds of approximately $417 million. The book value of the investment prior to sale was $246 million resulting in a pre tax gain on the sale of $171 million. 53 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Early Debt Extinguishment Costs In the second quarter 2005, the Company completed the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt for $544 million in cash and recorded a charge of $46 million for early debt extinguishment costs including $2 million in unamortized bond issuance costs. The book value of the purchased debt was $500 million.

Included in other charges are net losses on foreign exchange transactions, the Companys portion of losses from its equity investments (excluding Genencor), write downs to fair value of certain technology business venture investments due to other than temporary declines in value, and fees on securitized receivables. Included in 2006 other income is a $12 million gain resulting from a favorable decision of the U.S. Department of the Army to reimburse post employment benefits being provided to retirees of HDC, a wholly owned subsidiary. This gain reflected a portion of the unrecognized gain resulting from the reimbursement decision that will be amortized into earnings over future periods. For additional information, see Note 11, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Provision for Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Provision for income taxes $ 167 $ 222 (25) % Effective tax rate 28 % 29 % The 2006 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported earnings from continuing operations before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 31 percent. The effective tax rate was impacted by $25 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of capital loss carryforward valuation reserves and $11 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of foreign net operating loss valuation reserves. The 2005 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported earnings from continuing operations before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 30 percent. The effective tax rate was impacted by $13 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of capital loss carryforward valuation reserves, $14 million of tax benefit resulting from the change in reserves for tax contingencies due to the favorable resolution of prior periods tax contingencies, and a $11 million charge resulting from the repatriation of $321 million of foreign earnings and capital pursuant to provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 54 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings from Continuing Operations (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Earnings from continuing operations $ 427 $ 541 Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold, net of tax 6 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net of tax 69 23 Other operating income (68) (1) Gain on sale of investment in Genencor (111) Early extinguishment of debt costs 28 Net deferred tax benefit related to sale of certain businesses, product lines, and assets in the CASPI segment (12) Earnings from continuing operations excluding listed items $ 434 $ 468 Net Earnings (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Earnings from continuing operations $ 427 $ 541 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (18) 16 Net earnings $ 409 $ 557 SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT CASPI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 $ % Sales $ 1,421 $ 1,299 $ 122 9 % Volume effect 6 % Price effect 115 9 % Product mix effect 4 % Exchange rate effect (3) % Operating earnings 229 228 1 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 13 4 9 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 242 232 10 4 % Sales revenue increased $122 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to an increase in selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs. 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating earnings increased $1 million for 2006 compared to 2005 including increased asset impairments and restructuring charges. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $13 million for 2006 related to previously closed manufacturing facilities and severance costs related to a voluntary reduction in force. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $4 million for 2005 related primarily to previously closed manufacturing facilities. These charges are more fully described in Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Excluding these items, operating earnings increased due to an increase in selling prices that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and favorable product mix that resulted from higher sales volume for specialty coatings. In November 2006, the Company sold the CASPI segments EpoleneTM polymer businesses and related assets. CASPI sales revenue and operating earnings attributed to the divested businesses were $65 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2006.

The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs as well as continued strong demand for and limited supply of acetate yarn and acetyl chemical products. The increased sales volume and shift in product mix were due to strong demand for acetyl chemical products attributed to strengthened global acetate tow demand. Operating earnings for 2006 compared to 2005 increased $10 million as higher selling prices and increased sales volume more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $2 million in 2006 related primarily to severance costs of a voluntary reduction in force. 56 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 $ % Sales $ 1,659 $ 1,560 $ 99 6 % Volume effect 1 % Price effect 118 7 % Product mix effect (19) (1) % Exchange rate effect (1) % Sales contract ethylene sales (1) 27 27 Sales divested product lines (2) 111 104 7 Sales excluding listed items 1,521 1,456 65 4 % Volume effect (41) (3) % Price effect 118 8 % Product mix effect (11) (1) % Exchange rate effect (1) % Operating earnings 132 143 (11) (8) % Operating earnings (loss) divested product lines (2)(3) (15) (15) % Operating earnings excluding divested product lines (3) 147 143 (4) (3) % Operating earnings excluding certain items (3)(4) 161 154 7 5 % Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) divested product lines (2)(3) 3 3 % Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) excluding divested product lines (3) 158 151 7 5 % (1) Sales revenue for 2006 included contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses.

Accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, and other operating charges for 2006 were $2 million, $20 million, and $7 million, respectively. Asset impairments and restructuring charges for 2005 were $11 million related to previously impaired sites. The other operating charges resulted from the Batesville, Arkansas fourth quarter 2006 divestiture. Sales revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 increased $99 million primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly in the intermediates product lines, in response to increases in raw material and energy costs. 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating earnings decreased $11 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating charges, operating earnings increased compared with 2005 as higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. The 2005 operating earnings included $10 million of operating earnings from the achievement of certain milestones under an acetyls technology licensing agreement with SipChem. PCI sales revenue and operating loss attributed to the divested product lines were $111 million and $15 million, respectively, for 2006.

(2) Items are accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairment and restructuring charges, net. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $46 million for 2006 were primarily related to the shutdown of a research and development pilot plant in Kingsport, Tennessee, discontinued production of CHDM modified polymers in San Roque, Spain, and severance costs from a reduction in force in the U.S. and Spain. CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET production, was discontinued in San Roque, Spain to gain operational efficiencies at other facilities. Accelerated depreciation costs of $7 million in 2006 related to the restructuring decisions in association with cracking units in Longview, Texas, and higher cost PET polymer intermediates assets in Columbia, South Carolina, which are scheduled for shutdown. Other operating income was $75 million in 2006 from the divestiture of the PE businesses and assets.

Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (6) Items are accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) related to the U.S. PET manufacturing facilities. Asset impairments and restructuring charges were $46 million and accelerated depreciation costs were $7 million in 2006. Sales revenue decreased $16 million for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the effect of divested product lines and lower sales volume for PET polymers in North America attributed to lower industry capacity utilization rates partially offset by higher sales volume, particularly for PET polymers in Latin America. For U.S. PET manufacturing facilities, sales revenue decreased $46 million. 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating earnings decreased $91 million for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher and continued volatile raw material and energy costs, lower selling prices for PET polymers globally, increased asset impairments and restructuring charges, and increased accelerated depreciation costs more than offsetting other operating income and increased sales volume. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $46 million for 2006 were primarily related to the shutdown of a research and development Kingsport, Tennessee pilot plant, discontinued production of CHDM modified polymers in San Roque, Spain and severance related to a reduction in force in the U.S. and Spain. CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET production, was discontinued in San Roque, Spain to gain operational efficiencies at other facilities. Accelerated depreciation of $7 million for 2006 related to restructuring decisions in association with cracking units in Longview, Texas, and higher cost PET polymer intermediates assets in Columbia, South Carolina, which are scheduled for shutdown.

The increased sales volume was primarily attributed to continued market development efforts, particularly in copolyester product lines. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy costs with increases limited by competitive industry dynamics. Operating earnings for 2006 decreased $18 million compared with 2005 primarily due to asset impairments and restructuring charges, increased expenditures related to growth initiatives, and higher raw material and energy costs slightly more than offsetting increased sales volume and higher selling prices. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $16 million in 2006 were related to the discontinued production of CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET production, in San Roque, Spain to gain operational efficiencies at other facilities. Accelerated depreciation costs of $1 million for 2006 related primarily to South Carolina operations. 60 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 4,221 $ 4,098 3 % (1) % 5 % (1) % % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 816 753 8 % 3 % 5 % 1 % (1) % Asia Pacific 941 930 1 % (4) % 8 % (2) % (1) % Latin America 801 679 18 % 18 % (1) % 1 % % $ 6,779 $ 6,460 5 % 1 % 5 % (1) % % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly in the PCI segment, which had a $78 million positive impact on sales revenue. The higher selling prices were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs.

The higher selling prices were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volume and changes in mix. Higher selling prices, particularly in the Fibers segment, had a $76 million positive impact on sales revenue. Lower sales volume and negative mix, particularly for the Fibers segment, had a $61 million negative impact on sales revenue.

During 2007, the Company reduced working capital $86 million, primarily reductions in inventory. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $160 million in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements related to a higher mix of sales in Latin America and Europe, where customer credit terms are longer as compared to North America, partially offset by lower 2006 cash contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company contributed $100 million, $75 million, and $165 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Cash used in investing activities totaled $335 million, $94 million, and $18 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In 2007, the Company received approximately $42 million in proceeds from the sale of its San Roque, Spain manufacturing facility and related assets and $160 million in proceeds from the sale of its Mexico and Argentina manufacturing facilities and related assets. In 2006, the Company received $74 million in proceeds from the sale of its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and the specialty organic chemicals product lines and $235 million in proceeds from the sale of PE and EpoleneTM polymer businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site and the Companys ethylene pipeline. In 2005, the Company received $417 million net cash proceeds from the sale of its equity investment in Genencor. For more information concerning divestitures, see Note 6 "Equity Investments" and Note 17, "Divestitures", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capital spending of $518 million, $389 million, and $343 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, is discussed below. Cash used in financing activities totaled $448 million, $101 million, and $547 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively. In 2007 financing activities included a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $22 million and repurchases of stock totaling $382 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $91 million. Financing activities in 2006 included a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $50 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $83 million. Financing activities in 2005 included the Companys early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long term debt, and a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $150 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $98 million. See Note 9, "Early Extinguishment of Debt", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K for information regarding the early extinguishment of debt. In addition, the Company borrowed $191 million from a new credit facility in the fourth quarter 2005, the proceeds of which provided a significant part of the funding for the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The payment of dividends is also reflected in financing activities in all periods. 62 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity At December 31, 2007, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and foreign banks totaling approximately $888 million. These credit facilities consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") expiring in April 2012, as well as a 128 million euro credit facility ("Euro Facility") which expires in December 2012. The Credit Facility has a remaining option for a one year extension. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. The Credit Facility requires a facility fee on the total commitment that is based on Eastmans credit rating. In addition, these credit facilities contain a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2007, the Companys credit facility borrowings totaled $188 million at an effective interest rate of 4.79 percent. At December 31, 2006, the Companys credit facility borrowings were $185 million at an effective interest rate of 4.00 percent. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since the Credit Facility expires in April 2012, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long term borrowings because the Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis. For more information regarding interest rates, see Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company has effective shelf registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a combined $1.1 billion of debt and equity securities. In 2007, the Company made a $100 million contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company has no plans to make a contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2008. Cash flows from operations and the sources of capital described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However, the Companys cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastmans products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $518 million, $389 million, and $343 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase of $129 million in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to spending on expansion of acetate tow and copolyester intermediates manufacturing capacity, enhancements to the PET facilities in South Carolina utilizing IntegRexTM technology, and other growth initiatives. The Company expects that 2008 capital spending will be more than $600 million. In 2008, the Company will continue to pursue targeted growth initiatives, including debottlenecking the South Carolina manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology, completing front end engineering and design for the two industrial gasification projects, increasing capacity of cellulose triacetate ("CTA") for LCD screens, increasing manufacturing capacity for Eastman TritanTM copolyester, and completing the acetate tow capacity expansion in Workington, England. 63 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Commitments At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations related to notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.4 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 20 years. Other borrowings, related primarily to credit facility borrowings, totaled approximately $200 million. The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2007 totaling approximately $2.3 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month to month operating leases totaling approximately $177 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 10 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 55 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; and approximately 35 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2007 totaling approximately $1.0 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other post employment obligations, and environmental reserves. The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Payments Due for Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities (a) Total 2008 $ 72 $ $ 98 $ 508 $ 32 $ 148 $ 858 2009 14 96 460 26 73 669 2010 96 420 22 70 608 2011 2 96 253 20 59 430 2012 148 188 84 246 12 55 733 2013 and beyond 1,183 945 403 65 653 3,249 Total $ 1,405 $ 202 $ 1,415 $ 2,290 $ 177 $ 1,058 $ 6,547 (a) Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post employment benefits and taxes payable in the periods indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2007 totaled $155 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment. Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $29 million, $11 million, and $115 million will expire in 2008, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. 64 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As described in Note 6, "Equity Investments ", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastmans Kingsport, Tennessee plant. This investment is accounted for under the equity method. Eastmans net investment in the joint venture at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $43 million and $47 million, respectively, which was comprised of the recognized portion of the ventures accumulated deficits, long term amounts owed to Primester, and a line of credit from Eastman to Primester. As described in Note 12, "Commitments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K, Eastman entered into an agreement in 1999 that allows it to generate cash by reducing its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third party. Under this agreement, receivables sold to the third party totaled $200 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Undivided interests in designated receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the purchased interest in the receivable pools. The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. The Company has evaluated its material contractual relationships and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) or, in the case of Primester, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As such, in accordance with FASB Interpretation Number 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In addition, the Company has evaluated long term purchase obligations with two entities that may be VIEs at December 31, 2007. These potential VIEs are joint ventures from which the Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and purchases approximately $60 million of raw materials and utilities on an annual basis. The Company has no equity interest in these entities and has confirmed that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the potential VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company has not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the entities are VIEs, and if one or both are VIEs, whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company purchased equity interests in two development stage joint ventures related to the industrial gasification initiatives and accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting. As these joint ventures evolve and enter into material contractual relationships with the Company, its co investors in the joint ventures, and third parties, the Company will evaluate whether the joint ventures are VIEs and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and non consolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. Non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or liquidity. See Note 11, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K for off balance sheet post employment benefit obligations. 65 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Treasury Stock Transactions On February 4, 1999, the Company was authorized by its Board of Directors to repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock. Through January 2007, a total of 2.7 million shares of common stock was repurchased under the authorization at a cost of approximately $112 million. On February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors cancelled its prior authorization and approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock. The Company completed the $300 million repurchase authorization in September 2007, acquiring a total of 4.6 million shares. In October 2007, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $700 million for repurchase of the Companys outstanding common shares at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. As of December 31, 2007, a total of 1.3 million shares have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of approximately $82 million. Additional shares are expected to be repurchased under this authorization in 2008. Dividends The Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share for a total of $1.76 per share in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Preferred Stock Purchase Rights During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company redeemed all of the outstanding preferred stock purchase rights issuable pursuant to the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement and terminated the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement. The payment of $0.01 per share of common stock was made January 2, 2007. ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastmans policies as described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Companys preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 66 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $13 million to the maximum of $17 million at December 31, 2007. In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. FASB Interpretation No 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" (" FIN 47") requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation also clarifies that the term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation ("CARO") refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company performed a thorough examination of various asset categories. Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately 70 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2007. Currently, the Companys environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next 50 years. If the Company were to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. The Companys cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately $209 million, $214 million, and $198 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. These amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included expenditures for construction and development. The Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Companys planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. 67 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastmans costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market price fluctuations. The volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit. For additional information see Note 10, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R") which replaces SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141"). SFAS No. 141R retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. However, SFAS No. 141R provides for the following changes from SFAS No. 141: an acquirer will record 100% of assets and liabilities of acquired business, including goodwill, at fair value, regardless of the level of interest acquired; certain contingent assets and liabilities will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date; contingent consideration will be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date with changes in fair value to be recognized in earnings upon settlement; acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed as incurred; reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties will be recognized in earnings; and when making adjustments to finalize preliminary accounting, acquirers will revise any previously issued post acquisition financial information in future financial statements to reflect any adjustments as if they occurred on the acquisition date. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. SFAS No. 141R will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements when effective, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms, and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 provides that accounting and reporting for minority interests be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. This Statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS No. 160 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. 68 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," ("SFAS No. 157") which addresses the measurement of fair value by companies when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP. SFAS No. 157 provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP which is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for an entitys financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 6, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157 2 ("FSP FAS 157 2") which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). FSP FAS 157 2 partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Effective for first quarter 2008, the Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in FSP FAS 157 2. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. In February, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115," ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Upon adoption, an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Most of the provisions apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. SFAS No. 159 will be effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS No. 159 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. OUTLOOK For 2008, the Company expects: to maintain strong volumes due to continued substitution of Eastman products for other materials, and new applications for existing products despite uncertain prospects for the U.S. and global economies; the volatility of raw material and energy costs to continue and that the Company will continue to use pricing strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit; to improve the profitability of its PET product lines in the Performance Polymers segment, including completing the divestiture of its underperforming PET manufacturing facilities outside the United States; debottlenecking the new South Carolina PET facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology by the end of 2008 for a total capacity of 525,000 metric tons of ParaStarTM PET; shutting down another 300,000 metric tons of conventional PET polymers capacity at the South Carolina manufacturing facility by mid year; eliminating approximately $30 million of annual costs at the South Carolina site by the middle of 2008; and continuing to pursue options to create additional value from its IntegRexTM technology, primarily by actively pursing licensing opportunities; to improve SP segment results by completing the conversion of 50,000 metric tons of PET capacity to copolyester by the middle of 2008 and continue progress with the commercialization of its new copolyester, Eastman TritanTM copolyester; that the staged phase out of older cracking units in Longview, Texas and a planned shut down of higher cost PET assets in Columbia, South Carolina will result in accelerated depreciation costs of approximately $10 million; ethylene volumes to decline in the PCI segment due to the staged phase out of older cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility; 69 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS modest sales volume growth for acetate tow in the Fibers segment, to complete the expansion of its acetate tow plant in Workington, England, in the second half of 2008, and to announce plans for new acetate tow capacity in Asia; the PCI segment to have operating margins at the high end of the 5 to 10 percent range; the CASPI segment to maintain solid earnings at the low end of the 15 to 20 percent operating margin range and expects continued weakness in the U.S. housing and automotive sectors to be offset by strength in Europe and Asia; front end engineering and design for its two industrial gasification projects in Beaumont, Texas, and St. James Parish, Louisiana to be completed in the second half of 2008, and project financing to be obtained by the end of the year; net interest expense to increase compared with 2007 primarily due to lower interest income, driven by declining interest rates; the effective tax rate to be approximately 34 percent; capital spending will be above $600 million as it funds targeted growth efforts, including the debottlenecking of the South Carolina manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology, the completion of front end engineering and design for the two industrial gasification projects, increased capacity of CTA for LCD screens, increased capacity for Eastman TritanTM copolyester, and the completion of the acetate tow expansion in Workington, England; and priorities for uses of available cash to be to pay the quarterly cash dividend, fund targeted growth initiatives, and repurchase shares. As a result of the expectations listed above and strategic and other actions taken in recent years to improve profitability, the Company expects full year 2008 earnings per share to be similar to 2007 earnings per share excluding gains and charges in both periods related to strategic decisions and actions. In addition to the above, the Company expects significantly to improve earnings though strategic efforts in industrial gasification and growth initiatives in existing businesses over the next five years, and expects: its industrial gasification projects in Texas and Louisiana to break ground in early 2009, with the facilities online by 2011, and expects these projects to contribute significantly to earnings in 2012; the SP segment further to improve earnings by completing the conversion of an additional 50,000 metric tons of PET to be converted by 2010, increasing sales revenue from cellulose esters used in LCD screens and continued progress with the commercialization of its high performance copolyesters; to pursue licensing opportunities for the PCI segments acetyl and oxo technologies and for the Performance Polymers segments IntegRexTM technology; to pursue growth opportunities in Asia for acetate tow in the Fibers segment; and to complete an additional 30 percent expansion of its CASPI segments hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity in Middelburg, the Netherlands in early 2009. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. 70 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K may be forward looking in nature as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman Chemical Company; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; integration of acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described in this report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements: The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. There can be no assurance, however, that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. In addition, natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials and energy commodities, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities, could affect availability and costs of raw materials and energy commodities. While temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability and price are impacted by natural disasters, plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market and political conditions, changes in government regulation, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure. Eastmans operations or products may, at times, be adversely affected by these factors. 71 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys competitive position in the markets in which it participates is, in part, subject to external factors in addition to those that the Company can impact. Natural disasters, pandemic illnesses, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw materials and energy supplies to the Company and for delivery of the Companys products to customers, could negatively impact the Companys competitive position and its ability to maintain market share. For example, supply and demand for certain of the Companys products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of the Companys products. Limitation of the Companys available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations, including natural disasters, pandemic illnesses, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw materials and energy supplies to the Company and for delivery of the Companys products to customers, could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue, costs and results of operations and financial condition. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of the largest customers could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. The Company has efforts underway to exploit growth opportunities in certain core businesses by developing new products and technologies, expanding into new markets, and tailoring product offerings to customer needs. Current examples include IntegRexTM technology and new PET polymers products and copolyester product innovations. There can be no assurance that such efforts will result in financially successful commercialization of such products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor. The Company has made, and intends to continue making, strategic investments, including industrial gasification, and has entered, and expects to continue to enter, into strategic alliances in technology, services businesses, and other ventures in order to build, diversify, and strengthen certain Eastman capabilities, improve Eastmans raw materials and energy cost and supply position, and maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets. There can be no assurance that such investments and alliances will achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Companys results of operations or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Such delays or cost overruns or inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from these strategic investments and projects. 72 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company anticipates obtaining non recourse financing for the two industrial gasification projects. There is risk that such financing cannot be obtained or if, obtained, may be on terms different than those assumed in the Companys projections for financial performance of the projects, due to any circumstance, change, or condition in the loan syndication, financial, or capital markets generally that could reasonably be expected to materially affect availability, terms, and syndication of such financing. The ability to enter into financially acceptable project commercial agreements for such elements as engineering, procurement, and construction, off take agreements, commodity and or interest hedges, utilities, administrative services, and others, as well as obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals and operating permits, may impact the available financing for the projects or the terms of such financing, if available, including the nature and terms of any recourse back to the Company or other project equity owners. In addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives, the Company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases where warranted and accepted by the market; however, the Companys earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized, not be sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs, or have a negative impact on demand and volume. There can be no assurances that price increases will be realized or will be realized within the Companys anticipated timeframe. The Company has undertaken and expects to continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. The Companys facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future. The Companys accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. The Company and its operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating losses. The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Companys ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. 73 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Due to the Companys global sales, earnings, and asset profile, it is exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including swaps, options and forwards, to mitigate the impact of changes in exchange rates and interest rates on its financial results. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful and operating results could be affected by significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates. The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and elsewhere from time to time, represents managements best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects. 74 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations. To mitigate the Companys exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis, which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. Currently, these borrowings and investments are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent absolute shift in interest rates. For 2007 and 2006, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of 1 percent were approximately $104 million and $126 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates. The Companys operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. For 2007, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $31 million and an additional $3 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy. To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane and natural gas, the Company enters into forwards and options contracts. For 2007 and 2006, the market risks associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent were $20 million and $6 million, respectively, and an additional $2 million for each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter for both periods. 75
