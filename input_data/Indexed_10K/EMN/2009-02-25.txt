All references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. 31 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Companys management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment of long lived assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Companys management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Companys financial condition and results. These estimates require managements most significant judgments in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share is low. However, if one of the Companys key customers were to file for bankruptcy, or otherwise be unable to make its required payments, or there was a significant continued slow down in the economy, the Company could be forced to increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings. The Companys allowances were $7 million and $5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used, significant changes in business conditions, or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset. For long lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or an appraisal. For long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the Chemicals, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks (CASPI) segment, which has maintained earnings through the second half of 2008. As such, recent events did not warrant retesting. 32 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As the Companys assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change, additional write downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recognized no fixed (tangible) asset impairment costs and no definite lived intangible asset impairment costs in results from continuing operations during 2008. The Company recognized fixed (tangible) asset impairment costs of $120 million and definite lived intangible asset impairment costs of $2 million in results from continuing operations during 2007. Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $21 million at December 31, 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," (SFAS No. 143) the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as defined in SFAS No. 143, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years. If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease. In accordance with Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ("FIN 47"), the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The Companys reserve was $41 million at December 31, 2008 and $42 million at December 31, 2007, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs. Pension and Other Post employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets. For the U.S., at December 31, 2008, the Company assumed a discount rate of 6.08 percent on its defined benefit pension plan, 6.09 percent on its other post employment benefit plan and an expected return on assets of 9 percent. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company expects its 2009 pension expense to be similar to 2008. The December 31, 2008 projected benefit obligation and 2009 expense are affected by year end 2008 assumptions. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Companys long term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for the U.S. pension plan and other postretirement welfare plans: Change in Assumption Impact on 2009 Pre tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2008 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plan Impact on December 31, 2008 Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5 Million +$39 Million +$22 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5 Million $37 Million $21 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$3 Million No Impact N/A 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $3 Million No Impact N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Companys pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, and private equity markets. Historically, the Company has achieved an actual return which was equal to or greater than the expected return on assets. However, due to the global recession in 2008, the actual returns for 2008 were below expected returns. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations. As future benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations. The Company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets, which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years. If actual experience differs from these long term assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2008, 2007, and 2006 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $37 million, $47 million, and $54 million, respectively. 34 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during 2009 will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2009. However, an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, as of December 31, 2009 for the impact on the pensions projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations, see Note 11, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Based upon facts and information currently available, the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against earnings in particular periods. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2008, a valuation allowance of $131 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB No. 109, the Company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision. Prior to 2007, the Company determined tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The Company recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies were probable and could be reasonably estimated. 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STRATEGIC ACTIONS AND RELATED PRESENTATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES During 2007 and 2008, the Company took strategic actions in its Performance Polymers segment to address its underperforming polyethylene terephthalate (PET) manufacturing facilities outside the United States. In second quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of its PET manufacturing facility in Spain and in first quarter 2008, the Company completed the sale of its PET polymers and purified terephthalic acid (PTA) manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands and the PET manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom and related businesses. Results from, charges related to, and gains and losses from disposal of the Spain, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom assets and businesses are presented as discontinued operations. In fourth quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Mexico and Argentina manufacturing facilities. As part of this divestiture, the Company entered into transition supply agreements for polymer intermediates. In order to provide a better understanding of the impact on Performance Polymers segment results of the divested Latin American PET assets, this Managements Discussion and Analysis includes certain financial measures with and without sales and operating results in Latin America from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina and with and without contract polymer intermediates sales. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company sold its polyethylene ("PE") and EpoleneTM polymer businesses and related assets of the Performance Polymers and CASPI segments. As part of the PE divestiture, the Company entered into a transition supply agreement for contract ethylene sales, from which sales revenue and operating earnings are included in the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment results in 2008 and 2007. Also in fourth quarter 2006, the Company made strategic decisions relating to the scheduled shutdown of cracking units in Longview, Texas and a planned shutdown of higher cost PET assets in Columbia, South Carolina. Accelerated depreciation costs resulting from these decisions were $9 million and $49 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. For more information on accelerated depreciation costs, see "Gross Profit" in the "Results of Operations" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. In 2008, the Company sold certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site, recognizing $16 million of other operating income. This Managements Discussion and Analysis includes the following non GAAP financial measures and accompanying reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Company sales and segment sales and results from continuing operations excluding sales revenue and results from continuing operations from sales in Latin America of PET products manufactured at the divested Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing sites; Company and segment sales excluding contract ethylene sales under a transition agreement related to the divestiture of the PE product lines; Company and segment sales excluding contract polymer intermediates sales under a transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina; Company and segment gross profit, operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, and other operating income; and Company earnings from continuing operations excluding net deferred tax benefits related to the previous divestiture of businesses. 36 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Eastmans management believes that contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement related to the divestiture of the PE product lines, the contract polymer intermediates sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina, and the other operating income from the sale of mineral rights do not reflect the continuing and expected future business of the PCI and Performance Polymers segments or of the Company. In addition, for evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and of the impact on the Company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs and to improve the profitability of the Company, management believes that Company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with and without accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, and deferred tax benefits related to the previous divestiture of businesses, and that Company and segment sales and results from continuing operations should be considered both with and without sales revenue and results from continuing operations from sales in Latin America of PET products manufactured at the divested Mexico and Argentina manufacturing facilities. Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported Company and segment results, respectively, without the identified items. Management utilizes Company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance based compensation. These measures, excluding the identified items, are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance. 2008 OVERVIEW The Company generated sales revenue of $6.7 billion for 2008 compared to $6.8 billion for 2007. Excluding the results of contract ethylene sales, contract polymer intermediates sales, and sales from divested PET facilities in Mexico and Argentina, sales revenue increased by 3 percent. The sales revenue increase was due to increased selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs more than offsetting lower sales volume. Although the Company had some volume decline through the first nine months 2008 compared to first nine months 2007, in addition to normal seasonality, Eastmans sales volumes had an unprecedented drop in fourth quarter 2008 due to the global recession. Operating earnings were $519 million in 2008 compared to $504 million in 2007. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating income, operating earnings were $558 million in 2008 compared with $665 million in 2007. The Company had strong results, despite Eastman, and the chemical industry as a whole, facing unprecedented declines in demand, particularly in fourth quarter 2008, extremely volatile raw material and energy costs and an uncertain global economy. The lower full year operating earnings were driven by the year over year decline in fourth quarter results, primarily due to the sharp deterioration in demand. This decline in demand caused lower sales volume and historically low capacity utilization which resulted in higher unit costs. These challenges resulted in lower than anticipated operating margins for the majority of the segments and the Company as a whole. Primarily as a result of strategic actions related to the Performance Polymers and PCI segments, as well as a corporate severance program, operating earnings in 2008 were negatively impacted by $46 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges and $9 million of accelerated depreciation costs, and were positively impacted by $16 million in other operating income. Operating earnings in 2007 were negatively impacted by $112 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges and $49 million of accelerated depreciation costs. Asset impairments and restructuring charges for 2007 were primarily related to the divestiture of the Companys Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing sites. Earnings from continuing operations increased by $7 million for 2008 as compared to 2007. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, earnings from continuing operations were $342 million and $423 million, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations for 2008 compared to 2007 benefited from a lower effective tax rate. 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company generated $653 million in cash from operating activities during 2008 compared to $732 million generated by operating activities in 2007. The difference was primarily due to a more challenging economic environment resulting in lower net earnings excluding accelerated depreciation and asset impairments and restructuring charges. In 2007, the Company contributed $100 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and did not make any contributions in 2008. In 2008, the Company received proceeds from sales of assets and investments of $337 million, repurchased shares totaling $501 million, and repaid $175 million of borrowings. The Company believes that cash balances, cash flows from operations, and external sources of liquidity will be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $387 million of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $700 million committed revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility is substantially available through 2013, is supported by a diverse group of banks, and can be drawn for general corporate purposes. The Company is currently in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. In addition, there are no material debt maturities until 2012. The Company believes the combination of cash from operations, manageable leverage, and committed external sources of liquidity provides a solid financial foundation that positions it well in the current volatile economic and financial environments. In addition to the completion of the sale of its PET polymers and PTA manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands and the PET manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom in first quarter 2008, actions to improve the performance of its Performance Polymers segment including the transformation at the South Carolina facility. In the Fibers segment, the Company completed the acetate tow capacity expansion in the United Kingdom and announced a cellulose acetate tow alliance in Korea. Eastman continued to progress on its strategic growth initiatives including the industrial gasification project in the U.S. Gulf Coast and. In June 2008, as part of the progression on the gasification project in Beaumont, Texas, the Company acquired entire ownership interest in TX Energy, L.L.C. ("TX Energy") for approximately $35 million, which is primarily allocated to properties and equipment. Front end engineering and design for the project is planned to be completed by mid 2009. The Company is pursuing non recourse project financing utilizing the Department of Energys Federal Loan Guarantee Program and its completed application was submitted in November 2008. In 2008, the Company completed the purchase of an idled methanol and ammonia plant in Beaumont, Texas from Terra Industries Inc. and intends to restart these facilities using raw materials supplied via pipeline from the nearby gasification facility, once the gasification facility is complete. In December 2008, the Company announced an alliance with SK Chemicals Company Ltd. (SK) to form a company to acquire and operate a cellulose acetate tow manufacturing facility and related business, with the facility to be constructed by SK in Korea. Eastman will have majority ownership and will operate the facility. Construction began in first quarter 2009 and is expected to be completed during second quarter 2010. Annual capacity at the site is expected to be approximately 27,000 metric tons and Eastmans total worldwide capacity for acetate tow is expected to exceed 200,000 metric tons, an increase of 15 percent. The impact on global capacity is estimated to be an increase of approximately two percent. 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations as presented in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K are summarized and analyzed below. SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Sales $ 6,726 $ 6,830 (1) % (11) % 9 % % 1 % Sales sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities (1) 413 Sales contract polymer intermediates sales (2) 138 15 Sales contract ethylene sales (3) 314 314 Sales excluding listed items $ 6,274 $ 6,088 3 % (7) % 9 % % 1 % (1) Sales revenue for 2007 includes sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina divested in fourth quarter 2007. (2) Included in 2008 sales revenue are contract polymer intermediates sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina in fourth quarter 2007. (3) Included in 2008 and 2007 sales revenue are contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses. Sales revenue for 2008 compared to 2007 decreased $104 million. Excluding contract ethylene sales, contract polymer intermediates sales, and sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities, sales revenue increased 3 percent primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments in response to higher raw material and energy costs more than offsetting lower sales volume, particularly in the Performance Polymers, PCI, and CASPI segments. Although the Company experienced some volume decline through the first nine months 2008 compared to first nine months 2007, the global recession, experienced particularly in fourth quarter 2008, resulted in an unprecedented decrease in sales volume across all segments and all regions in fourth quarter 2008 compared to fourth quarter 2007. 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Gross Profit $ 1,126 $ 1,192 (6) % As a percentage of sales 17 % 17 % Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 9 49 Gross Profit excluding accelerated depreciation costs 1,135 1,241 (9) % As a percentage of sales 17 % 18 % Gross profit for 2008 decreased compared with 2007 in the PCI, Specialty Plastics (SP) and CASPI segments partially offset by increases in the Performance Polymers and Fibers segments, as higher raw material and energy costs more than offset higher selling prices. Gross profit included accelerated depreciation costs of $9 million and $49 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, resulting from the previously reported shutdowns of the cracking units in Longview, Texas and of higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. The Companys 2008 raw material and energy costs increased by approximately $600 million compared with 2007. An unprecedented decline in demand caused lower sales volume and historically low capacity utilization resulting in higher unit costs in fourth quarter 2008. The historically low capacity utilization rates in the fourth quarter negatively affected the average capacity utilization rate for the full year 2008. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") $ 419 $ 420 % Research and Development Expenses ("R&D") 158 156 1 % $ 577 $ 576 % As a percentage of sales 9 % 8 % Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $46 million and $112 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2008 were primarily for restructuring at the South Carolina facility in the Performance Polymers segment, severance and pension costs from the decision to close a previously impaired site in the United Kingdom in the PCI segment, and severance costs resulting from a corporate severance program. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2007 were primarily costs associated with the PET manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Argentina sold in fourth quarter 2007. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, primarily related to recent strategic decisions and actions, see the Performance Polymers and PCI segments discussion and Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income, net for 2008 reflects proceeds of $16 million from the sale of certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site. 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Earnings 2008 2007 Change (Dollars in millions) Operating earnings $ 519 $ 504 3 % Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 9 49 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 46 112 Other operating income, net (16) Operating earnings excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairment and restructuring charges, net, and other operating income, net $ 558 $ 665 (16) % Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Gross interest costs $ 106 $ 113 Less: capitalized interest 12 10 Interest expense 94 103 (9) % Interest income 24 41 Interest expense, net $ 70 $ 62 13 % Gross interest costs for 2008 compared to 2007 were lower due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings. Interest income in 2008 compared to 2007 was lower due to lower average invested cash balances and lower average interest rates. For 2009, the Company expects net interest expense to increase compared with 2008 primarily due to lower interest income, driven by lower average invested cash balances and lower average interest rates.

Equity and business venture investments (gains) losses include gains of $4 million in both 2008 and 2007 resulting from a favorable decision of the U.S. Department of the Army to reimburse post employment benefits being provided to retirees of HDC, a wholly owned subsidiary. This gain reflected a portion of the unrecognized gain resulting from the reimbursement decision that will be amortized into earnings over future periods. For additional information, see Note 11, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Provision for Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Provision for income taxes $ 101 $ 149 (32) % Effective tax rate 24 % 32 % The 2008 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported earnings from continuing operations before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 27 percent. The 2008 effective tax rate was impacted by a $16 million benefit resulting from a gasification investment tax credit of $11 million and a research and development credit of $5 million, a $14 million benefit from state income tax credits (net of federal tax effect), and a $6 million benefit from the settlement of a non U.S. income tax audit. The 2007 effective tax rate reflects the Companys tax rate on reported earnings from continuing operations before income tax, excluding discrete items, of 33 percent. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2009 will be between 30 and 33 percent, including investment tax credits and research and development tax credits.

The loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax of $11 million in 2007 is from the sale of the Companys PET polymers manufacturing facility in Spain for approximately $42 million. During 2007, the Company also recognized site closure costs of $4 million, net of tax, for the San Roque PET site. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are managed and reported in five reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the PCI segment, the Performance Polymers segment, and the SP segment. For additional information concerning the Companys operating businesses and products, refer to Note 23, "Segment Information", to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Sales revenue and expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 23, "Segment Information", as "other" sales revenue and operating losses. CASPI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 $ % Sales $ 1,524 $ 1,451 $ 73 5 % Volume effect (148) (10) % Price effect 167 12 % Product mix effect 34 2 % Exchange rate effect 20 1 % Operating earnings 202 235 (33) (14) % Asset impairments and restructuring gains (1) (1) Other operating income (5) (5) Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring gains and other operating income 197 234 (37) (16) % Sales revenue for 2008 increased $73 million compared to 2007 due to higher selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for propane, propylene, and adhesives raw materials. Sales volume declined due primarily to the recession in North America and the divestiture of certain adhesives product lines, partially offset by slightly higher sales volume in Asia Pacific. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring gains and other operating income, operating earnings for 2008 decreased $37 million compared to 2007 due primarily to lower sales volume and lower capacity utilization, particularly in fourth quarter, causing higher unit costs. Other operating income for 2008 reflects the segments allocated portion of proceeds from the sale of certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating margins, typically in the range of 15 percent to 20 percent, were slightly below the anticipated range in 2008 due primarily to the impact of the recession in North America, particularly in the automotive and construction industries. Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 $ % Sales $ 1,045 $ 999 $ 46 5 % Volume effect (11) (1) % Price effect 59 6 % Product mix effect (3) % Exchange rate effect 1 % Operating earnings 238 238 % Sales revenue for 2008 increased $46 million compared to 2007 due to higher selling prices. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp and coal. An increase in acetate tow sales volume was offset by a decrease in acetyl chemical and acetate yarn sales volume. Operating earnings for 2008 were flat compared to 2007, as an increase in acetate tow sales volume was offset by a decrease in acetyl chemical and acetate yarn sales volume. The capacity expansion of the Companys acetate tow plant in Workington, England was completed in 2008, expanding Eastmans world wide capacity by five percent, better enabling Eastman to serve existing customers in Western Europe and the growing demand in Eastern Europe. In December 2008, the Company announced an alliance with SK to form a company to acquire and operate a cellulose acetate tow manufacturing facility and related business, with the facility to be constructed by SK in Korea. Eastman will have majority ownership and will operate the facility. Construction began in first quarter 2009 and should be completed during the second quarter 2010. Despite current economic conditions, the Fibers segment had operating margins in its typical 20 percent to 25 percent range in 2008. 44 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 $ % Sales $ 2,160 $ 2,095 $ 65 3 % Volume effect (219) (10) % Price effect 289 14 % Product mix effect (15) (1) % Exchange rate effect 10 % Sales contract ethylene sales 314 314 Sales excluding listed items 1,846 1,781 65 4 % Volume effect (135) (8) % Price effect 225 13 % Product mix effect (35) (2) % Exchange rate effect 10 1 % Operating earnings 153 220 (67) (31) % Accelerated depreciation costs included in cost of goods sold 5 19 (14) Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) 22 (1) 23 Other operating income (9) (9) Operating earnings excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), and other operating income 171 238 (67) (28) % Sales revenue for 2008 increased $65 million compared to 2007. Excluding contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement resulting from the divestiture of the Performance Polymers segments PE business in fourth quarter 2006, sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes, particularly in fourth quarter 2008. Lower sales volumes were primarily in olefin based derivative products, particularly for Asia, and bulk olefins product lines related to the previously reported shutdown of a cracking unit in fourth quarter 2007. Contract ethylene sales revenues remained unchanged as higher selling prices offset lower sales volume resulting from the shutdown of one of the Companys cracking units. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) and other income, operating earnings in 2008 decreased $67 million compared to 2007. The decline was primarily in the Asia Pacific region due to lower sales volume, particularly for olefin based derivative product lines, and higher raw material and energy costs partially offset by higher selling prices. Sales revenue and operating earnings for 2007 included $22 million of earnings from the licensing of acetyl technology. In addition, 2007 operating earnings were impacted by favorable market conditions. In 2007, contract ethylene sales had minimal impact on operating earnings. The accelerated depreciation costs were related to the continuation of the previously reported planned staged phase out of older cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility. Asset impairments and restructuring charges for 2008 consisted primarily of severance and pension costs from the decision to close a previously impaired site in the United Kingdom. Asset impairments and restructuring gains for 2007 were primarily related to severance costs related to a voluntary reduction in force in 2006. Other operating income for 2008 reflects the segments allocated portion of proceeds from the sale of certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site. Despite current economic conditions, the PCI segment had operating margins in its typical 5 percent to 10 percent range.

(3) Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Performance Polymers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 $ % Operating loss excluding certain items (1)(2) $ (29) $ (65) $ 36 55 % Operating loss excluding certain items from sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities (1)(3)(4) (12) 12 100 % Operating loss excluding certain items U.S. PET manufacturing facilities (1)(5) (29) (53) 24 45 % (1) Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (2) Items are accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges, net. In 2008, asset impairments and restructuring charges of $24 million related to restructuring at the South Carolina facility using IntegRexTM technology, the divested PET manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Argentina, and charges related to a corporate severance program, partially offset by a resolution of a contingency from the sale of the Companys PE and EpoleneTM polymer businesses divested in fourth quarter 2006. Accelerated depreciation costs of $4 million resulted from restructuring actions associated with higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. In 2007, asset impairments and restructuring charges of $113 million primarily related to the Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities sale. Accelerated depreciation costs of $29 million resulted from restructuring actions associated with higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. (3) Operating results for 2007 includes sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina divested in fourth quarter 2007. (4) Items are asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) relating to the Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities, and were $3 million and $115 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. (5) Items are accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) related to the U.S. PET manufacturing facilities. Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) were $21 million and $(2) million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Accelerated depreciation costs were $4 million and $29 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales revenue for 2008 decreased $339 million compared to 2007 due to the divestiture of PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina. For U.S. PET manufacturing facilities, excluding contract polymer intermediates sales to the buyer of the divested Mexico and Argentina facilities and sales from the divested PET facilities in Mexico and Argentina, sales revenue for 2008 decreased $49 million compared to 2007 due to lower sales volume resulting from the shutdown of higher cost PET assets in the first half of 2008, weaker demand for bottled carbonated soft drinks, and lighter weight water bottles. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating expense, operating results for 2008 for U.S. PET manufacturing facilities improved $24 million compared to 2007 due primarily to actions at the Companys South Carolina PET facility, including the PET facility based on IntegRex technology and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs and higher unit costs due to lower capacity utilization particularly in fourth quarter. Manufacturing ParaStarTM PET resins, the 350,000 metric ton PET manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology in Columbia, South Carolina was fully operational in first quarter of 2007. A previously disclosed reduction of $30 million in annual costs at this facility was completed in second quarter 2008. The debottleneck of the PET facility based on IntegRexTM technology was successfully completed in fourth quarter 2008, expanding annual capacity of the plant to 525,000 metric tons of ParaStarTM PET resins. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SP Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 $ % Sales $ 923 $ 872 $ 51 6 % Volume effect (9) (1) % Price effect 28 3 % Product mix effect 16 2 % Exchange rate effect 16 2 % Operating earnings 35 65 (30) (46) % Accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold 1 (1) Asset impairments and restructuring charges 1 (1) Other operating income (2) (2) Operating earnings excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and other operating income 33 67 (34) (51) % Sales revenue for 2008 increased $51 million compared to 2007 due to higher selling prices, a favorable exchange rate and a favorable shift in product mix. Selling prices increased in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene and ethylene glycol. While sales volume in full year 2008 decreased only slightly, increases through nine months 2008 compared to nine months 2007 were more than offset by a sharp decline in sales volume in fourth quarter 2008 attributed to the global recession particularly impacting end use demand for consumer and durable goods (appliances and electronics), in store fixtures and displays, and specialty packaging. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating income, operating earnings for 2008 decreased $34 million compared to 2007 due to higher raw material and energy costs and lower capacity utilization resulting in higher unit costs, particularly in fourth quarter 2008. The 2008 operating results included $2 million in other operating income related to the segments allocated portion of proceeds from the sale of certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site. The 2007 operating results included $1 million in asset impairment and restructuring costs primarily for the Spain cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM") facility and $1 million of accelerated depreciation costs for restructuring actions associated with higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. The SP segment is progressing with the introduction of its new copolyester, Eastman TritanTM copolyester, including a new 30,000 metric ton TritanTM manufacturing facility expected to be online in 2010. 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 4,065 $ 4,043 1 % (12) % 12 % 1 % % Asia Pacific 1,185 1,103 8 % 1 % 6 % % 1 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 977 932 5 % (2) % 1 % 2 % 4 % Latin America 499 752 (34) % (33) % 4 % (5) % % $ 6,726 $ 6,830 (1) % (11) % 9 % % 1 % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased slightly primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments and a favorable shift in product mix, particularly in the CASPI segment, partially offset by lower sales volumes in all segments. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Sales volume increased in the CASPI, Fibers and SP segments, partially offset by lower sales volume primarily in the PCI segment. Sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased primarily due to the effect of the foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in the CASPI, SP and Fibers segments. Sales revenue in Latin America decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, particularly in the Performance Polymers segment. Excluding divested PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina and contract polymer intermediates sales to those facilities, sales revenue increased 12 percent primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments as a result of higher raw material and energy costs and higher sales volume, particularly in the PCI segment. During fourth quarter 2007, the Company sold its PET polymers production facilities in Mexico and Argentina and the related businesses, which is expected to result in significantly lower sales revenue in Latin America in future periods. However, subject to certain product specific agreements associated with the sale of the manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Argentina, the Company sold a limited set of PET products manufactured in the U.S. in certain Latin American markets through 2008. With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars or euros. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For more information on these practices see Note 10, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 49 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Sales $ 6,830 $ 6,779 1 % (3) % 3 % % 1 % Sales contract ethylene sales (1) 314 27 Sales 2006 divested product lines (2) 811 Sales sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities (3) 413 440 Sales excluding listed items $ 6,103 $ 5,501 11 % 5 % 4 % 1 % 1 % (1) Included in 2007 and 2006 sales revenue are contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses.

(3) Included in 2007 and 2006 sales revenue are sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Cosoleacaque, Mexico and Zarate, Argentina divested in fourth quarter 2007. These sales are not considered discontinued operations due to continuing involvement in the Latin America region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. Sales revenue for 2007 compared to 2006 increased $51 million. Excluding contract ethylene sales, sales from 2006 divested product lines, and sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities, sales revenue increased 11 percent primarily due to higher sales volume, particularly in the Performance Polymers and PCI segments, and higher selling prices in all segments except the Performance Polymers segment in response to higher raw material and energy costs.

For additional information refer to Note 17, "Divestitures", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. R&D expenses for 2007 were flat compared to 2006 as decreased expenses in Performance Polymers resulting from the fourth quarter 2006 completion of the Companys new PET manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology in Columbia, South Carolina were offset by increased spending on the industrial gasification initiatives and on growth projects in the SP segment. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $112 million and $101 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2007 were primarily costs associated with the PET manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Argentina sold in fourth quarter 2007. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2006 were primarily severance charges for work force reductions and impairments resulting from the shutdown of an R&D pilot plant and the shutdown of the CHDM manufacturing assets in San Roque, Spain. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, primarily related to recent strategic decisions and actions, see the Performance Polymers segment discussion and Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Selling prices increased in response to higher raw material and energy costs. The lower sales volume was primarily attributed to the divestiture of the Companys EpoleneTM product lines in fourth quarter 2006 and slightly lower sales volume for coatings product lines in North America. Operating earnings for 2007 increased $6 million compared to 2006. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, operating earnings decreased $8 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in operating earnings is primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily in the coatings product lines, partially offset by higher selling prices, a favorable shift in product mix, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2006 were related to previously closed manufacturing facilities and severance costs related to a voluntary reduction in force. 54 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 $ % Sales $ 999 $ 910 $ 89 10 % Volume effect 25 3 % Price effect 51 6 % Product mix effect 9 1 % Exchange rate effect 4 % Operating earnings 238 226 12 5 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 2 (2) Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 238 228 10 4 % Sales revenue for 2007 increased $89 million compared to 2006 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. Selling prices increased primarily due to efforts to offset higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp. The increased sales volume was attributed to continued industry market growth in acetate tow product lines and competitor outages. Operating earnings for 2007 increased $12 million compared to 2006 due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $2 million in 2006 primarily related to severance costs of a voluntary reduction in force. 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 $ % Sales $ 2,095 $ 1,659 $ 436 26 % Volume effect 401 24 % Price effect 74 4 % Product mix effect (49) (3) % Exchange rate effect 10 1 % Sales contract ethylene sales (1) 314 27 287 Sales divested product lines (2) 111 (111) Sales excluding listed items 1,781 1,521 260 17 % Volume effect 131 9 % Price effect 98 6 % Product mix effect 22 1 % Exchange rate effect 9 1 % Operating earnings 220 132 88 67 % Operating earnings (loss) divested product lines (2)(3) (15) 15 100 % Operating earnings excluding divested product lines (3) 220 147 73 50 % Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) 238 161 77 48 % Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) divested product lines (2)(3) 3 (3) (100)% Operating earnings excluding certain items (4) excluding divested product lines (3) 238 158 80 51 % (1) Sales revenue for 2007 and 2006 included contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses. (2) Sales revenue and operating results for 2006 included sales revenue from sales of products of the divested product lines of the Companys Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic chemicals product lines. (3) Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (4) Items are accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) and other operating charges. Accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring gains for 2007 were $19 million and $1 million, respectively. Accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, and other operating charges for 2006 were $2 million, $20 million, and $7 million, respectively. The accelerated depreciation costs are related to the continuation of the planned staged phase out of older cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility. Asset impairments and restructuring charges were primarily related to the divestiture of the PCI segments Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic chemicals product lines completed in fourth quarter 2006 and to severance costs related to a voluntary reduction in force in 2006. The other operating charges resulted from the Batesville, Arkansas divestiture. 56 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales revenue for 2007 increased $436 million compared to 2006 primarily due to contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement resulting from the divestiture of the Performance Polymers segments PE business in the fourth quarter 2006. Excluding the contract ethylene sales and sales revenue from divested product lines, sales revenue for 2007 increased due to higher sales volume and increased selling prices, which were attributed to favorable market conditions, primarily for olefin based derivative products and acetyl chemicals in Asia Pacific and the United States, and competitor outages. Operating earnings increased $88 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairment and restructuring charges (gains), and other operating charges, operating earnings increased $77 million. The increase is due to higher sales volume, higher selling prices, and earnings from the licensing of acetyl technology, with contract ethylene sales having minimal impact on operating earnings for 2007 compared to 2006. Selling prices increased in response to higher raw material and energy costs. The accelerated depreciation costs are related to the continuation of the planned staged phase out of older cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility. The Company evaluates licensing opportunities for acetic acid and oxo derivatives on a selective basis, and has licensed technology for two projects to produce acetyl products one to Saudi International Petrochemical Company ("SipChem") in Saudi Arabia in 2005, and a second to Chang Chung Petrochemical Company in Taiwan in 2007. In the fourth quarter 2006 the Company completed its divestiture of the PCI segments Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic chemicals product lines. Sales revenue and operating loss attributed to the divested product lines were $111 million and $15 million, respectively for 2006. 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Performance Polymers Segment As a result of the Companys strategic actions in the Performance Polymers segment, the financial discussion below is of results from continuing operations in all periods presented. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K.

(2) Items are accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net and other operating income. In 2007, asset impairments and restructuring charges of $113 million primarily related to the Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities sale. Accelerated depreciation costs of $29 million resulted from restructuring actions associated with higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. In 2006, asset impairments and restructuring charges of $46 million were primarily related to the shutdown of a research and development Kingsport, Tennessee pilot plant, discontinued production of CHDM modified polymers in San Roque, Spain and severance costs from a reduction in force in the U.S. and Spain. CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET production, was discontinued in San Roque, Spain to gain operational efficiencies at other facilities. Accelerated depreciation of $7 million in 2006 related to the restructuring decisions and actions for higher cost PET polymer intermediates assets in Columbia. Other operating income was $75 million in 2006 from the divestiture of the PE businesses and assets. (3) Items are other operating income from the sale of the PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site which were sold in fourth quarter 2006, and which were $75 million in 2006. (4) PE product lines of the PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site which were sold in fourth quarter 2006. Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (5) Items are asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) relating to the Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities, and were $115 million in 2007. (6) Sales revenue and operating results for 2007 and 2006 include sales revenue from PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina divested in fourth quarter 2007. These sales are not presented as discontinued operations due to the Performance Polymers segments continuing involvement in the Latin American region and raw material sales to the divested facilities. Includes allocated costs consistent with the Companys historical practices, some of which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and other segments. (7) Items are accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) related to the U.S. PET manufacturing facilities. Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains) were $(2) million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accelerated depreciation costs were $29 million and $7 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales revenue decreased $558 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the divested PE product lines. For U.S. PET manufacturing facilities, sales revenue increased $104 million primarily due to the increased North America sales volumes attributed to increased capacity from the Companys ParaStarTM PET facility based on IntegRexTM technology. 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Excluding operating losses from sales from Mexico and Argentina PET manufacturing facilities of $127 million and $12 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and operating earnings from the divested PE product lines of $136 million in 2006, operating results decreased $24 million for 2007 compared to 2006. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation costs, operating results from U.S. manufacturing facilities decreased $50 million due to costs associated with the new PET facility based on IntegRexTM technology becoming fully operational and the timing of the commercial launch of ParaStarTM PET produced in the IntegRexTM technology facility as well as higher and continued volatile raw material and energy costs resulting in compressed gross margins, particularly in North America. Production began in November 2006 at the Companys new PET manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology in Columbia, South Carolina. Manufacturing ParaStarTM next generation PET resins, the 350,000 metric tons facility was fully operational in first quarter of 2007. During fourth quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of Eastmans PET polymers production facilities in Mexico and Argentina and the related businesses. Sales revenue attributed to PET product manufactured at the Mexico and Argentina PET sites for 2007 and 2006 was $413 million and $440 million, respectively.

Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material, energy, and transportation costs. The increased sales volume was primarily attributed to continued market development efforts, particularly in copolyester and cellulose esters product lines, which more than offset a decline in demand for polyester products used in photographic and optical films. 60 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating earnings increased $19 million. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation costs, operating earnings for 2007 increased compared to 2006 as higher selling prices and favorable foreign currency exchange rates more than offset increased raw material and energy costs and increased expenditures related to growth initiatives. The 2007 operating earnings included $1 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges primarily for the Spain CHDM facility and $1 million of accelerated depreciation costs from restructuring actions for higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. The 2006 operating results included $16 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges related to the discontinued production of CHDM and $1 million of accelerated depreciation costs from restructuring actions for higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South Carolina. SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 4,043 $ 4,221 (4) % (4) % 2 % (2) % % Asia Pacific 1,103 941 17 % 3 % 8 % 6 % % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 932 816 14 % 3 % 3 % 2 % 6 % Latin America 752 801 (6) % (8) % 2 % % % $ 6,830 $ 6,779 1 % (3) % 3 % % 1 % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada decreased primarily due to lower volumes particularly in the CASPI and Performance Polymers segments due to the divestitures in those segments, partially offset by higher volumes in the PCI segment due to the contract ethylene sales. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher selling prices and a favorable shift in product mix, primarily in the PCI segment. Product mix was positively impacted by $20 million from technology licensing in the PCI segment. Sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased due to the effect of the foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in the CASPI and SP segments, higher selling prices, particularly in the Fibers and SP segments, and higher volumes, particularly in the SP and Fibers segments. The higher selling prices were primarily in response to increases in raw material and energy costs. Sales revenue in Latin America decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, particularly in the Performance Polymers segment. Excluding divested product lines and manufacturing facilities, sales revenue was flat. During the fourth quarter 2007, the Company sold its PET polymers production facilities in Mexico and Argentina and the related businesses, which will result in significantly lower sales revenue in Latin America in future periods. However, subject to certain product specific agreements associated with the sale of the manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Argentina, the Company continued to sell a limited set of PET products manufactured in the U.S. in certain Latin American markets. 61 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash Flows (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 653 $ 732 $ 609 Investing activities (376) (335) (94) Financing activities (779) (448) (101) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 1 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (501) $ (51) $ 415 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 387 $ 888 $ 939 Cash provided by operating activities decreased $79 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a more challenging economic environment resulting in lower net earnings excluding accelerated depreciation and asset impairments and restructuring charges. During 2008, the Company increased working capital by $45 million primarily due to reductions in accounts payable and an increase in inventory partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities increased $123 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to changes in working capital. During 2007, the Company reduced working capital by $86 million, primarily due to reductions in inventory. The Company contributed $100 million and $75 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2007 and 2006, respectively. There was no contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2008. Cash used in investing activities totaled $376 million, $335 million, and $94 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2008, the Company received approximately $337 million net cash proceeds primarily from the sale of the Companys PET polymers and PTA manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands and the PET manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. In 2007, the Company received approximately $42 million in proceeds from the sale of its San Roque, Spain manufacturing facility and related assets and $160 million in proceeds from the sale of its Mexico and Argentina manufacturing facilities and related assets. In 2006, the Company received $74 million in proceeds from the sale of its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and the specialty organic chemicals product lines and $235 million in proceeds from the sale of PE and EpoleneTM polymer businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site and the Companys ethylene pipeline. For more information concerning divestitures, see Note 2, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale, Note 7, "Acquisition and Divestiture of Industrial Gasification Interests", and Note 17, "Divestitures", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capital spending of $634 million, $518 million, and $389 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, is discussed below. Cash used in financing activities totaled $779 million, $448 million, and $101 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. Financing activities in 2008 included the Companys repayment of $72 million of its outstanding long term debt that matured in 2008, a repayment of $103 million of its Euro credit facility, a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $7 million, and repurchases of stock totaling $501 million offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $35 million. In 2007, financing activities included a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $22 million and repurchases of stock totaling $382 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $91 million. Financing activities in 2006 included a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $50 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $83 million. The payment of dividends is also reflected in financing activities in all periods. 62 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company expects to generate positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends) in 2009, with the priorities for uses of available cash to be payment of the quarterly cash dividend, funding targeted growth initiatives and defined benefit pension plans, and repurchasing shares. Liquidity At December 31, 2008, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and foreign banks totaling approximately $800 million. These credit facilities consist of the $700 million Credit Facility and a 60 million euro credit facility ("Euro Facility"). The Credit Facility has two tranches, with $125 million expiring in 2012 and $575 million expiring in 2013. The Euro Facility expires in 2012. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. The Credit Facility requires a facility fee on the total commitment that is based on Eastmans credit rating. In addition, these credit facilities contain a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2008, the Companys credit facility borrowings totaled $84 million, primarily the Euro Facility, at an effective interest rate of 3.74 percent. At December 31, 2007, borrowings on these credit facilities were $188 million, primarily from the Euro Facility, at an effective interest rate of 4.79 percent. The Company used part of the proceeds from the sale of its PET polymers and PTA production facilities in the Netherlands and its PET production facility in the United Kingdom and related businesses to reduce the balance outstanding on its Euro Facility by $103 million in second quarter 2008. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since the Credit Facility expires in April 2013, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long term borrowings because the Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis. Additionally, the Company maintains a $200 million accounts receivable securitization program that is available to provide liquidity through the sale of receivables and was fully drawn at December 31, 2008. For more information, see Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements below and Note 12, Commitments, to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. For more information regarding interest rates, see Note 9, "Borrowings", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. In 2008, the Company made no contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company expects to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009 of between $25 million and $50 million. Cash flows from operations and the other sources of liquidity described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However, the Companys cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastmans products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. 63 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $650 million, $518 million, and $389 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase of $132 million in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to increasing manufacturing capacity for Eastman TritanTM copolyester, debottlenecking the South Carolina PET manufacturing facility utilizing IntegRexTM technology, the purchase of assets from Terra Industries Inc., completing the acetate tow capacity expansion in Workington, England, front end engineering and design for the industrial gasification project, and increasing capacity of cellulose triacetate (CTA) for liquid crystal display (LCD) screens. The Company expects that 2009 capital spending will be $350 million to $400 million, which is sufficient for required maintenance and certain strategic growth initiatives. The Company expects that 2009 depreciation and amortization will be at or slightly higher than 2008 expenses of approximately $260 million, excluding accelerated depreciation. Other Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations related to notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.4 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 20 years. Other borrowings, related primarily to credit facility borrowings, totaled approximately $100 million. The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2008 totaling approximately $1.6 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month to month operating leases totaling approximately $115 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 16 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 41 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; and approximately 43 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2008 totaling approximately $1.5 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other post employment obligations, and environmental reserves. 64 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Payments Due for Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities (a) Total 2009 $ $ 13 $ 100 $ 351 $ 30 $ 240 $ 734 2010 100 387 26 84 597 2011 2 100 246 22 58 428 2012 154 84 92 243 14 53 640 2013 85 230 9 54 378 2014 and beyond 1,202 877 140 14 1,042 3,275 Total $ 1,358 $ 97 $ 1,354 $ 1,597 $ 115 $ 1,531 $ 6,052 (a) Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post employment benefits and taxes payable in the periods indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2008 totaled $152 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment. Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $2 million, $11 million, and $139 million will expire in 2009, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. As described in Note 6, "Equity Investments ", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastmans Kingsport, Tennessee plant. This investment is accounted for under the equity method. Eastmans net investment in the joint venture at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $39 million and $43 million, respectively, which was comprised of the recognized portion of the ventures accumulated deficits, long term amounts owed to Primester, and a line of credit from Eastman to Primester. As described in Note 12, "Commitments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K, Eastman entered into an agreement in 1999 that allows it to generate cash by reducing its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third party. Under this agreement, receivables sold to the third party totaled $200 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Undivided interests in designated receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the purchased interest in the receivable pools. The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. 65 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company has evaluated its material contractual relationships and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) or, in the case of Primester, a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the Companys Kingsport, Tennessee plant, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As such, in accordance with FASB Interpretation Number 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities", the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In addition, the Company has evaluated long term purchase obligations with an entity that may be a VIE at December 31, 2008. This potential VIE is a joint venture from which the Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and purchases approximately $50 million of raw materials and utilities on an annual basis. The Company has no equity interest in this entity and has confirmed that one party to this joint venture does consolidate the potential VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company has not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the entity is a VIE, and whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary. Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and non consolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. Non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or liquidity. See Note 11, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K for off balance sheet post employment benefit obligations. Treasury Stock Transactions On February 4, 1999, the Company was authorized by its Board of Directors to repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock. Through January 2007, a total of 2.7 million shares of common stock were repurchased under the authorization at a cost of approximately $112 million. On February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors cancelled its prior authorization and approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock. The Company completed the $300 million repurchase authorization in September 2007, acquiring a total of 4.6 million shares. In October 2007, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $700 million for repurchase of the Companys outstanding common shares at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. As of December 31, 2008, a total of 9.4 million shares have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of approximately $583 million. Dividends The Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share for a total of $1.76 per share in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The Company has declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share during the first quarter of 2009, payable on April 1, 2009 to stockholders of record on March 16, 2009. 66 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastmans policies as described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Companys preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $21 million at December 31, 2008. In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation also clarifies that the term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation ("CARO") refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company performed a thorough examination of various asset categories. Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 67 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately 70 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2008. Currently, the Companys environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next 50 years. If the Company were to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. The Companys cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately $218 million, $209 million, and $214 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. These amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included expenditures for construction and development. The Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Companys planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastmans costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market price fluctuations. The volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit. For additional information see Note 10, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective first quarter 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements", ("SFAS No. 157"), except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities addressed in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position FAS 157 2 ("FSP FAS 157 2"). The FASB issued FSP FAS 157 2 which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company has concluded that FSP FAS 157 2 will not have an impact the Companys consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 68 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R") which replaces SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141"). SFAS No. 141R retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. However, SFAS No. 141R provides for the following changes from SFAS No. 141: an acquirer will record 100% of assets and liabilities of acquired business, including goodwill, at fair value, regardless of the level of interest acquired; certain contingent assets and liabilities will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date; contingent consideration will be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date with changes in fair value to be recognized in earnings upon settlement; acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed as incurred; reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties will be recognized in earnings; and when making adjustments to finalize preliminary accounting, acquirers will revise any previously issued post acquisition financial information in future financial statements to reflect any adjustments as if they occurred on the acquisition date. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. SFAS No. 141R will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements when effective, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms, and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 provides that accounting and reporting for minority interests be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. This Statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company has concluded that SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS Statement No. 161 "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 161"). The new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. It is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The new standard also improves transparency about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entitys financial statements; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The Company has concluded that SFAS No. 161 will not have a material impact on the Companys disclosures. In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 03 6 1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities" ("EITF Issue No. 03 6 1"). The FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method. The FSP affects entities that accrue dividends on share based payment awards during the awards service period when the dividends do not need to be returned if the employees forfeit the award. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company has concluded that EITF Issue No. 03 6 1 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 69 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R) 1, "Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R) 1). This FSP amends FASB Statement No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to provide guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the effect FSP FAS 132(R) 1 will have on its disclosures. OUTLOOK For 2009, the Company expects: declines in volume due to the global recession, partially offset by continued substitution of Eastman products for other materials and new applications for existing products despite the softening U.S. and global economies; the volatility of market prices for raw material and energy to continue and that the Company will continue to use pricing strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives in an attempt to offset the effects on gross profit; most segments will be challenged to meet their typical operating margins with the current uncertainty of the global recession; modest sales volume growth for acetate tow in the Fibers segment. The Company will invest in its alliance with SK to form a company to acquire and operate a cellulose acetate tow manufacturing facility and related business in Korea; to complete an additional 30 percent expansion of its CASPI segments hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity in Middelburg, the Netherlands; ethylene volume to decline in the PCI segment due to the staged phase out of older cracking units at the Companys Longview, Texas facility; the SP segment will continue to progress with the introduction of its new copolyester, Eastman TritanTM copolyester, including a new 30,000 metric ton TritanTM manufacturing facility expected to be online in 2010; to improve the profitability of its PET product lines in the Performance Polymers segment as a result of previous restructuring actions and to continue to pursue options to create additional value from its IntegRexTM technology, primarily by actively pursuing licensing opportunities; to complete the front end engineering and design for the industrial gasification project by mid 2009 and to pursue non recourse project financing utilizing the Department of Energys Federal Loan Guarantee Program; depreciation and amortization to be at or slightly higher than 2008; pension expense to be similar to 2008. The Company anticipates defined benefit pension plans funding of between $25 million and $50 million; net interest expense to increase compared with 2008 primarily due to lower interest income, driven by lower average invested cash balances and lower average interest rates; the effective tax rate to be between 30 and 33 percent, including the benefit of the investment tax credit and the research and development tax credit; 70 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS capital spending to be between $350 million and $400 million as it selectively funds targeted growth efforts, while prioritizing capital spending, including the increased capacity for Eastman TritanTM copolyester and the front end engineering and design for the industrial gasification project; to generate positive free cash flow; and priorities for uses of available cash to be payment of the quarterly cash dividend, fund targeted growth initiatives and defined benefit pension plans, and repurchase shares. In addition to the above, the Company expects to significantly improve earnings over the long term through strategic efforts and growth initiatives in existing businesses, and expects: the SP segment to improve earnings by continued focus on copolyesters growth, increasing sales revenue from cellulose esters used in LCD screens and continued progress with the introduction of its high performance copolyesters; to pursue licensing opportunities for the PCI segments acetyl and oxo technologies and for the Performance Polymers segments IntegRexTM technology; to pursue additional growth opportunities in Asia for acetate tow in the Fibers segment; and to continue exploring options with industrial gasification. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors below. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K may be forward looking in nature as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman Chemical Company; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; integration of acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. 71 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements: Conditions in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect the Companys results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Companys business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by the global recession, including the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges currently affecting the global economy. The Companys customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to the Company. If the global recession continues for significant future periods or deteriorates significantly, the Companys results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. There can be no assurance, however, that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. In addition, natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw material and energy commodities, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could affect availability and costs of raw material and energy commodities. While temporary shortages of raw material and energy may occasionally occur, these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability and price are impacted by natural disasters, plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market and political conditions, changes in government regulation, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure. Eastmans operations or products may, at times, be adversely affected by these factors. The Companys competitive position in the markets in which it participates is, in part, subject to external factors in addition to those that the Company can impact. Natural disasters, pandemic illnesses, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw material and energy supplies to the Company and for delivery of the Companys products to customers, could negatively impact the Companys competitive position and its ability to maintain market share. For example, supply and demand for certain of the Companys products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of the Companys products. 72 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Limitation of the Companys available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations, including natural disasters, pandemic illnesses, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw material and energy supplies to the Company and for delivery of the Companys products to customers, could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue, costs and results of operations and financial condition. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of the largest customers could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. The Company has efforts underway to exploit growth opportunities in certain core businesses by developing new products and technologies, licensing technologies, expanding into new markets, and tailoring product offerings to customer needs. Current examples include IntegRexTM technology and new PET polymers products and TritanTM and other copolyester product innovations. There can be no assurance that such efforts will result in financially successful commercialization of such products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor. The Company has made, and intends to continue making, strategic investments, including in industrial gasification, and has entered, and expects to continue to enter, into strategic alliances in technology, services businesses, and other ventures in order to build, diversify, and strengthen certain Eastman capabilities, improve Eastmans raw material and energy cost and supply position, and maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets. There can be no assurance that such investments and alliances will achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Companys results of operations or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from these strategic investments and projects. The Company anticipates obtaining non recourse project financing for its industrial gasification project. There is risk that such financing cannot be obtained or, if obtained, may be on terms different than those assumed in the Companys projections for financial performance of the project, due to any circumstance, change, or condition in the loan syndication, financial, capital markets, or government loan guarantee programs, that could reasonably be expected to materially affect availability, terms, and syndication of such financing. The ability to enter into financially acceptable project commercial agreements for such elements as engineering, procurement, and construction, off take agreements, commodity and or interest hedges, utilities, administrative services, and others, as well as obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals and operating permits, may impact the available financing for the project or the terms of such financing, if available, including the nature and terms of any recourse back to the Company. In addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives, the Company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases where warranted and accepted by the market; however, the Companys earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized, not be sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs, or have a negative impact on demand and volume. There can be no assurances that price increases will be realized or will be realized within the Companys anticipated timeframe. 73 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company has undertaken and expects to continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. The Companys facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future. The Companys accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. The Company and its operations from time to time are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating losses. The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Companys ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. Due to the Companys global sales, earnings, and asset profile, it is exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including swaps, options and forwards, to mitigate the impact of changes in exchange rates and interest rates on its financial results. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful and operating results could be affected by significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates. 74 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys sources of liquidity have been and are expected to be cash from operating activities, available cash balances, the revolving $700 million credit facility, sales of domestic receivables under the $200 million accounts receivable securitization program, the commercial paper market, and the capital markets. Additionally, the Company relies upon third parties to provide it with trade credit for purchases of various products and services. While the Company maintains business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions, their continued viability is not certain and could lead them not to honor their contractual credit commitments or to renew their extensions of credit or provide new sources of credit. Furthermore, trade creditors may be unable to obtain credit and reduce their trade credit extension. Recently, the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure or near failure of a number of large financial services companies. If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited, the Company may incur increased costs associated with borrowings. In addition, it is possible that the Companys ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when it would like, or need, to do so, which could have an impact on the Companys ability to finance its business or react to changing economic and business conditions. While the Company believes that recent governmental and regulatory actions reduce the risk of a further deterioration or systemic contraction of capital and credit markets, there can be no certainty that the Companys liquidity will not be negatively impacted. Company borrowings are subject to a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. While the Company expects to remain in compliance with such covenants, there is no certainty that events and circumstances will not result in covenant violations which could limit access to credit facilities or cause events of default with outstanding borrowings. In addition, the Companys cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable consequences to the Companys customers and the markets in which the Company competes as a result of the current financial, economic, and capital and credit market conditions and uncertainty. The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and elsewhere from time to time, represents managements best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects. 75 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations. To mitigate the Companys exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis, which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. Currently, these borrowings and investments are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates. For 2008 and 2007, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately $107 million and $104 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates. The Companys operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies; and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. For 2008, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $39 million and an additional $4 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. For 2007, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $31 million and an additional $3 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy. To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane and natural gas, the Company enters into option and forward contracts. For 2008, there was limited market risk associated with options and forwards for these same commodities. For 2007, the market risk associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $20 million and an additional $2 million for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. 76
