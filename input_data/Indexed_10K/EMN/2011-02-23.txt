All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. The Company completed the sale of the polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment on January 31, 2011. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under GAAP. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Companys management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience an d on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Companys management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Companys financial condition and results. These estimates require managements most significant judgments in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results is low. However, if one of the Companys key customers was to file for bankruptcy, or otherwise be unwilling or unable to make its required payments, or there was a significant slow down in the economy, the Company could increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings. The Companys allowances were $6 million and $10 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing. Reporting units are identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of goodwill, additional steps, including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, would be necessary to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") and Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segments. The Company also had recorded goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. In fourth quarter 2009, the Company announced the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project, which resulted in an impairment of the Beaumont industrial gasification project goodwill and other intangible assets. As the Companys assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change, additional write downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recognized a definite lived intangible asset impairment charge of $8 million resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting the fair value of air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas, gasification project. The Company recognized fixed (tangible) asset impairment charges of $133 million and goodwill and definite lived intangible asset impairment charges of $46 million in results from continuing operations during 2009, related to the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. 34 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, an d chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $10 million to the maximum of $27 million at December 31, 2010. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as defined by GAAP, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years. If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The Companys reserve, including the above remediation, was $40 million at December 31, 2010 and $42 million at December 31, 2009, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs. Pension and Other Post employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides a subsidy toward life insurance, health care, and dental benefits for eligible retirees and a subsidy toward health care and dental benefits for retirees eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets. For the U.S. plans, at December 31, 2010, the Company assumed a discount rate of 5.26 percent on its defined benefit pension plans, 5.36 percent on its other post employment benefit plan and an expected return on assets of 8.75 percent. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographi c assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The December 31, 2010 projected benefit obligation and 2011 expense are affected by year end 2010 assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Companys long term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Pre tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2010 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plans Impact on December 31, 2010 Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$6 Million +$42 Million +$25 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5 Million $40 Million $24 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$3 Million No Impact N/A 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $3 Million No Impact N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Companys pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, and private equity markets. Historically, over a ten year period, excluding 2008 which is considered an anomaly due to the global recession, the Companys average achieved actual return has been equal to or greater than the expected return on assets. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post em ployment benefit obligations. As future benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations. The Company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets, which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years. If actual experience differs from these long term assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2010, 2009, and 2008 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $56 million, $45 million, and $37 million, respectively. 36 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during 2011 will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2011. However, an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, as of December 31, 2011 for the impact on the pensions projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors.&#1 60; For further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations, see Note 13, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Based upon facts and information currently available, the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against earnings in particular periods. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome from future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision f or income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2010, a valuation allowance of $48 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. The Company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision. 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRESENTATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the following non GAAP financial measures and accompanying reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Company and segment sales excluding the contract ethylene sales under a transition agreement related to the divestiture of the polyethylene ("PE") product lines and contract polymer intermediates sales under a transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina described below; Company and segment gross profit and operating earnings excluding the accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and other operating income described below; Company earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share excluding the accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, other operating income, early debt extinguishment costs, and net deferred tax benefits related to the previous divestiture of businesses described below; and Cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets described below. During 2010, the Company recognized $29 million in asset impairment and restructuring charges including $20 million in severance and pension curtailment, $8 million for an intangible asset impairment resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas gasification project, and $1 million of additional site closure charges. During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new five and ten year debt securities and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. During first quarter 2010, the Company adopted amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Companys $200 million accounts receivable securitization program. For periods beginning after December 31, 2009, transfers of receivables interests that were previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet are included in trade receivables, net and reflected as secured borrowings on the balance sheet. The Companys Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2010 reflects an increase in trade receivables of $200 million, the amount transferred at December 31, 2009 under the securitization program, which reduced cash flows from operating activities by that amount for 2010. At December 31, 2010, there wer e no transfers of receivables interests under the accounts receivable securitization program. During 2009, the Company recognized $196 million in asset impairment and restructuring charges, primarily consisting of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Companys previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force. The Companys decision to discontinue the industrial gasification project was due to a number of factors, including high capital costs, the current and projected reduced spread between natural gas and oil and petroleum coke prices, and continued uncertainty regarding U.S. energy and environmental public policy. In 2008, the Company sold certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site, recognizing $16 million of other operating income. 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fourth quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Mexico and Argentina manufacturing facilities in its Performance Polymer segment. As part of this divestiture, the Company entered into transition supply agreements for polymer intermediates from which sales revenue and operating results are included in the PCI segment results in 2008. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company sold its PE and EpoleneTM polymer businesses and related assets of the Performance Polymers and CASPI segments. As part of the PE divestiture, the Company entered into a transition supply agreement for contract ethylene sales, from which sales revenue and operating earnings are included in the PCI segment results in 2009 and 2008. Also in fourth quarter 2006, the Company made strategic decisions relating to the scheduled shutdown of cracking units in Longview, Texas. Accelerated depreciation costs resulting from these decisions was $5 million in 2008. For more information on accelerated depreciation costs, see "Gross Profit" in the "Summary of Consolidated Results 2009 Compared With 2008 Results of Operations" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Eastmans management believes that contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement related to the divestiture of the PE product lines, contract polymer intermediates sales under a transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PET assets and businesses in Mexico and Argentina, and the other operating income from the sale of mineral rights do not reflect the continuing and expected future business of the PCI segment or of the Company. In addition, for evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and the impact on the Company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs, to improve the profitability of the Company, and favorably adjust its debt maturities and cost, management believes that Company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with an d without accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, deferred tax benefits related to the previous divestiture of businesses, and early debt extinguishment costs. Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported Company and segment results, respectively, without the identified items. Management utilizes Company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance based compensation. These measures, excluding the identified items, are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance. 2010 OVERVIEW The Company generated sales revenue of $5.8 billion and $4.4 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The sales revenue increase was due primarily to higher sales volume attributed to improved end use demand in packaging, durable goods, and other markets, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives. Sales revenue increases were also due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings were $862 million in 2010 compared to $345 million in 2009. Operating earnings in 2010 were negatively impacted by restructuring charges of $29 million, primarily consisting of $20 million in severance and pension curtailment as well as $8 million for an intangible asset impairment resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas gasification project. Operating earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by asset impairment and restructuring charges, net, of $196 million, primarily consisting of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Companys discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, operating earnings were $891 million in 2010 compared with $541 million in 2009. The increase in operating earnings was due to higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs. In addition, higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings in 2010 included $12 million from acetyl license revenue. In first quarter 2010, the Company experienced a power outage at its Longview, Texas manufacturing facility. Costs related to the outage were mostly offset by the settlement of the related insurance claim. Operating earnings in 2009 included approximately $20 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings from continuing operations were $425 million in 2010 compared to $154 million in 2009. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings from continuing operations were $514 million and $281 million, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations were $5.75 per diluted share in 2010 compared to $2.09 per diluted share in 2009. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings were $6.96 per diluted share and $3.83 per diluted share, respectively. Eastman generated $575 million in cash from operating activities in 2010. Excluding the $200 million impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance in first quarter 2010 described above in "Presentation of Non GAAP Financial Measures", the Company generated $775 million in cash from operating activities in 2010 primarily due to higher net earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital. Excluding the impact of the adoption of this amended accounting guidance, the Company generated free cash flow of $405 million for full year 2010. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. In 2010, the Company progressed on its organic growth initiatives: In the Specialty Plastics segment, the monomer manufacturing facility and the first Eastman TritanTM copolyester polymer manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee commenced production in first quarter 2010. The Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity for TritanTM, which is expected to be operational in early 2012. In the Specialty Plastics segment, the Company is expanding its capacity for cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM"), a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyester, and expects the capacity to be operational in two phases in mid 2011 and in 2012. In the Specialty Plastics segment, the Company is expanding its cellulose triacetate capacity, with the new capacity expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. In the CASPI segment, the Company is expanding capacity for its specialty hydrocarbon resins through an additional expansion of the Companys hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity in Middelburg, the Netherlands which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2011, an additional debottleneck of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon facility in Longview, Texas, which is expected to be operational in the first half of 2011, and an expansion of the pure monomer and hydrogenated resins production capacity in Jefferson, Pennsylvania, which is expected to be operational in 2012. In the PCI segment, the Company plans to increase capacity of 2 ethyl hexanol in 2012 to support expected growth in the plasticizers, coatings, and fuel additive markets. The Company continues to explore and invest in research and development ("R&D") initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally friendly chemistry, including an initiative in the building and construction market. The Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment on January 31, 2011. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under GAAP. The sale is not expected to impact product lines in the Specialty Plastics segment. The total cash proceeds of the transaction were $600 million, subject to post closing adjustment for working capital. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations as presented in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report are summarized and analyzed below. 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Sales $ 5,842 $ 4,396 33 % 19 % 10 % 4 % % Sales revenue for 2010 compared to 2009 increased $1.4 billion. The sales revenue increase was due primarily to higher sales volume in all segments attributed to improved end use demand in packaging, durable goods, and other markets, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives. Sales revenue increases were also due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily in the PCI and CASPI segments. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Gross Profit $ 1,474 $ 1,032 43 % As a percentage of sales 25 % 23 % Gross profit for 2010 increased compared with 2009 in all segments. The increase was due to higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs. In addition, higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Gross profit in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue. In first quarter 2010, the Company experienced a power outage at its Longview, Texas manufacturing facility. Costs related to the outage were mostly offset by the settlement of the related insurance claim. Gross profit in 2009 included approximately $20 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. The reconfiguration costs impacted the PCI and CASPI segments. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") $ 431 $ 367 17 % Research and Development Expenses 152 124 23 % $ 583 $ 491 19 % As a percentage of sales 10 % 11 % SG&A expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased performance based compensation expense and higher discretionary spending, including expenses for growth initiatives. R&D expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher R&D expenses for growth initiatives. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, totaled $29 million and $196 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2010 consisted primarily of severance and pension curtailment charges and an intangible asset impairment. Severance charges of $18 million included $15 million for the previously announced voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010 and $3 million primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Genovique Specialties Corporation ("Genovique") in second quarter 2010. Restructuring charges of $2 million for pension curtailment are also related to the voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010. The intangible asset impairment of $8 million resulted from an environmental regulatory change impac ting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas gasification project in fourth quarter 2010. Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, in 2009 primarily consisted of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Companys previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges, primarily related to recent strategic decisions and actions, see Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Operating Earnings 2010 2009 Change (Dollars in millions) Operating earnings $ 862 $ 345 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 29 196 Operating earnings excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, net $ 891 $ 541 65 % Net Interest Expense (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Gross interest costs $ 108 $ 99 Less: capitalized interest 3 14 Interest expense 105 85 24 % Interest income 6 7 Net interest expense $ 99 $ 78 27 % Net interest expense increased $21 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower capitalized interest resulting from lower capital spending and higher average borrowings. For 2011, the Company expects net interest expense to decrease compared with 2010 primarily due to lower borrowing costs resulting from debt restructuring completed during fourth quarter and higher capitalized interest resulting from higher capital spending. During fourth quarter 2010, Eastman restructured a portion of its debt through the early repayment of $500 million of outstanding debt securities and issuance of $500 million in new debt securities at lower interest rates and more favorable maturities. 42 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Early Debt Extinguishment Costs During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new five and ten year debt securities and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long term debt. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Provision for Income Taxes From Continuing Operations (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Provision for income taxes from continuing operations $ 211 $ 100 &gt;100 % Effective tax rate 33 % 39 % The 2010 effective tax rate reflects a $9 million tax charge associated with a nondeductible, early distribution under the executive deferred compensation plan of previously earned compensation as a result of certain participants electing early withdrawal. The 2009 effective tax rate reflected an $11 million tax charge associated with the recapture of gasification investment tax credits, a $7 million tax charge associated with a change in accounting method for tax purposes to accelerate timing of deductions for manufacturing repairs expense and a $5 million tax benefit from the reversal of tax reserves due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be approximately 33 percent. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions, except diluted EPS) $ EPS $ EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 425 $ 5.75 $ 154 $ 2.09 Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net of tax 18 0.24 127 1.74 Early debt extinguishment costs, net of tax 71 0.97 Earnings from continuing operations excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net of tax and early debt extinguishment costs, net of tax $ 514 $ 6.96 $ 281 $ 3.83 Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share (Dollars in millions, except diluted EPS) 2010 2009 $ EPS $ EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 425 $ 5.75 $ 154 $ 2.09 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 13 0.17 (18) (0.24) Net earnings $ 438 $ 5.92 $ 136 $ 1.85 Earnings of $13 million and loss of $18 million, net of tax in 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulted from discontinued operations of the PET business of the Performance Polymers segment.

SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are managed and reported in four reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the PCI segment, and the Specialty Plastics segment. For additional information concerning the Companys operating businesses and products, refer to Note 23, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment on January 31, 2011. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under GAAP. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Sales revenue and expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 23, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, as "other" sales revenue and operating losses. As discussed in Note 23, these "other" operating losses are $66 million and $218 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in 2009 is $179 million in asset impairments related to the discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. 44 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CASPI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,574 $ 1,217 $ 357 29 % Volume effect 198 16 % Price effect 122 10 % Product mix effect 43 4 % Exchange rate effect (6) (1) % Operating earnings 293 221 72 33 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 6 3 3 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 299 224 75 34 % Sales revenue for 2010 increased $357 million compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices. The higher sales volume was attributed to strengthened end use demand in the packaging and transportation markets primarily in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa and the United States and Canada regions, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, and the positive impact of growth initiatives, including the hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity expansion in Middelburg, the Netherlands which was completed in fourth quarter 2009. The higher selling prices were primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for propane. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, operating earnings for 2010 increased $75 million compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume, higher capacity utilization, which led to lower unit costs, and higher selling prices, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings in 2009 included approximately $5 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. The asset impairments and restructuring charges, net for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,142 $ 1,032 $ 110 11 % Volume effect 61 6 % Price Effect 4 % Product mix effect 46 5 % Exchange rate effect (1) % Operating earnings 323 292 31 11 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 3 4 (1) Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 326 296 30 10 % Sales revenue for 2010 increased $110 million compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and a favorable shift in product mix. The higher sales volume and favorable shift in product mix were due to higher sales volume of acetate tow and of acetate yarn, both attributed to strengthened demand due to the global economic recovery. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, operating earnings for 2010 increased $30 million compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume for acetate tow and acetate yarn, improved acetyl stream capacity utilization and a favorable shift in product mix. The asset impairments and restructuring charges, net for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. During first quarter 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of and commenced production at the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility. Commercial operations have commenced and customer qualifications are substantially complete. The facility is now fully integrated into the segments production and sales processes. 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 2,083 $ 1,398 $ 685 49 % Volume effect 333 24 % Price effect 295 21 % Product mix effect 58 4 % Exchange rate effect (1) % Operating earnings 224 41 183 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 7 6 1 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 231 47 184 &gt;100 % In first quarter 2010, the Company transferred certain intermediates product lines from the Performance Polymers segment, now included in discontinued operations, to the PCI segment to improve optimization of manufacturing assets supporting the three raw material streams that supply the Companys downstream businesses. Segment sales and operating results for prior years have been reclassified for the change. In second quarter 2010, the Company acquired Genovique, a global producer of specialty non phthalate plasticizers for water based adhesives and other applications. Sales revenue for 2010 increased $685 million compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices. The higher sales volume included growth in plasticizer product lines, both in heritage products as well as in product lines added with the acquisition of Genovique plasticizer product lines, and also attributed to strengthened end use demand due to the global economic recovery. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, operating earnings in 2010 increased $184 million compared to 2009 due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs, higher sales volume, and increased capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs. Operating earnings in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue. The asset impairments and restructuring charges, net for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. Operating results in 2009 included approximately $15 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. To further improve its competitive cost position over purchasing olefins in the North American market, the Company restarted a previously idled cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility in 2010. This restart was prompted by a favorable shift in market conditions for olefin raw materials that is expected to continue over the next several years. The Company has three operating cracking units, including the unit restarted in 2010. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Specialty Plastics Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,043 $ 749 $ 294 39 % Volume effect 240 32 % Price effect 14 2 % Product mix effect 37 5 % Exchange rate effect 3 % Operating earnings 88 9 79 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 5 4 1 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 93 13 80 &gt;100 % Sales revenue for 2010 increased $294 million compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume. The higher sales volume was attributed to improved end use demand across all markets, in part due to the global economic recovery, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives for core copolyesters and the TritanTM copolyester product lines. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, operating earnings for 2010 increased $80 million compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume, resulting in higher capacity utilization and lower unit costs. The asset impairments and restructuring charges, net for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. The monomer manufacturing facility and the first Eastman TritanTM copolyester resin manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee commenced production in first quarter 2010. The Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity for TritanTM, which is expected to be operational in early 2012. The Company is also expanding its capacity for CHDM, a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyester, by approximately 25 percent and expects the capacity to be operational in two phases in mid 2011 and in 2012 and expanding its cellulose triacetate capacity by approximately 70 percent, with the new capaci ty expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 2,957 $ 2,252 31 % 19 % 12 % % % Asia Pacific 1,446 1,062 36 % 18 % 10 % 7 % 1 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,150 835 38 % 23 % 5 % 12 % (2) % Latin America 289 247 17 % 9 % 7 % 1 % % $ 5,842 $ 4,396 33 % 19 % 10 % 4 % % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volumes in all segments, particularly the PCI segment, and higher selling prices in all segments except the Fibers segment. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume particularly in the Specialty Plastics segments, higher selling prices in all segments, and a favorable shift in product mix in all segments. Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and a favorable shift in product mix in all segments. The region had minimal price effect change compared to other regions due to fewer sales from commodity product lines. Sales revenue in Latin America increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices in all segments. With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars or euros. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For more information on these practices see Note 12, "Derivatives", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 49 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Sales $ 4,396 $ 5,936 (26) % (16) % (10) % % % Sales contract ethylene sales (1) 28 314 Sales contract polymer intermediates (2) 138 Sales excluding listed items $ 4,368 $ 5,484 (20) % (9) % (10) % (1) % % (1) Sales revenue for 2009 and 2008 included contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses in fourth quarter 2006. (2) Sales revenue for 2008 included contract polymer intermediates sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina in fourth quarter 2007. Sales revenue for 2009 compared to 2008 decreased $1.5 billion. Excluding contract ethylene sales and contract polymer intermediates sales, sales revenue decreased 20 percent due to lower selling prices in response to lower raw material and energy costs, particularly in the PCI segment, and lower sales volume primarily attributed to weakened demand due to the global recession.

This weak demand caused lower sales volume and lower capacity utilization which, resulted in higher unit costs. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased due to improved performance in the Fibers and CASPI segments. The Fibers segment benefited from higher selling prices, while the CASPI segment had lower raw material and energy costs more than offsetting lower selling prices. The Company also benefited from cost reduction actions in 2009. In addition, 2009 results included approximately $20 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility, which impacted the PCI and CASPI segments. Gross profit i ncluded accelerated depreciation costs of $5 million in 2008 resulting from the previously reported shutdown of the cracking units in Longview, Texas, of which one was subsequently restarted in 2010. 50 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") $ 367 $ 384 (4) % Research and Development Expenses 124 143 (13) % $ 491 $ 527 (7) % As a percentage of sales 11 % 9 % SG&A expenses decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower discretionary spending and compensation expense resulting from cost reduction actions partially offset by increased compensation expense linked to the Companys higher stock price. R&D expenses decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower R&D expenses for corporate growth initiatives, including the industrial gasification project in Beaumont, Texas and the commercialized Eastman TritanTM copolyester. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, totaled $196 million and $22 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2009 primarily consisted of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Companys previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2008 consist primarily of restructuring charges for severance and pension charges in the PCI segment resulting from the decision to close a previously impaired site in the United Kingdom.

Corporate costs which were allocated to the Performance Polymers segment have been reallocated to other segments in the Companys financial statements. The gain from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax of $18 million in 2008 was from the sale of the Companys PET polymers and purified terephthalic acid ("PTA") production facilities in the Netherlands and its PET production facility in the United Kingdom and related businesses for approximately $329 million in first quarter 2008. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale ", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are managed and reported in four reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the PCI segment, and the Specialty Plastics segment. For additional information concerning the Companys operating businesses and products, refer to Note 23, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment on January 31, 2011. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under GAAP. For additional information, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Sales revenue and expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 23, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, as "other" sales revenue and operating losses. 53 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CASPI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 $ % Sales $ 1,217 $ 1,524 $ (307) (20) % Volume effect (184) (12) % Price effect (96) (6) % Product mix effect (30) (2) % Exchange rate effect 3 % Operating earnings 221 196 25 (13) % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 3 3 Other operating income (5) 5 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net and other operating income 224 191 33 (17) % Sales revenue for 2009 decreased $307 million compared to 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices. The lower sales volume was due to weak customer demand in all regions except Asia Pacific, attributed to the global recession, particularly for products sold into the building and construction, transportation, and packaging markets. The lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material and energy costs. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and other operating income, operating earnings for 2009 increased $33 million compared to 2008 due primarily to lower raw material and energy costs and cost reduction actions partially offset by lower sales volume and approximately $5 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. The asset impairments and restructuring charges, net for 2009 reflect the segments portion of the severance charge for a reduction in force in first quarter 2009 and an adjustment to a reserve for previously divested businesses and product lines. Other operating income for 2008 reflects the segments allocated portion of proceeds from the sale of certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site. 54 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fibers Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 $ % Sales $ 1,032 $ 1,046 $ (14) (1) % Volume effect (89) (8) % Price effect 83 8 % Product mix effect (11) (1) % Exchange rate effect 3 % Operating earnings 292 234 58 25 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 4 4 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 296 234 62 26 % Sales revenue for 2009 decreased $14 million compared to 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume mostly offset by higher selling prices. The lower sales volume was primarily for acetyl chemical products. The higher selling prices were in response to higher wood pulp costs. Excluding the segments portion of the severance charge for a reduction in force in first quarter 2009, operating earnings for 2009 increased $62 million compared to 2008 primarily due to higher selling prices and cost reduction actions, partially offset by lower sales volume. 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PCI Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 $ % Sales $ 1,398 $ 2,443 $ (1,045) (43) % Volume effect (580) (24) % Price effect (507) (21) % Product mix effect 39 2 % Exchange rate effect 3 % Sales contract ethylene sales (1) 28 314 (286) contract polymer intermediates sales (2) 138 (138) Sales excluding listed items 1,370 1,991 (621) (31) % Volume effect (113) (6) % Price effect (499) (25) % Product mix effect (12) % Exchange rate effect 3 % Operating earnings 41 143 (102) (71) % Accelerated depreciation costs included in cost of sales 5 (5) Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 6 22 (16) Other operating income (9) 9 Operating earnings excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and other operating income 47 161 (114) (71) % (1) Sales revenue for 2009 and 2008 included contract ethylene sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PE businesses in fourth quarter 2006. (2) Sales revenue for 2008 includes contract polymer intermediates sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the PET manufacturing facilities and related businesses in Mexico and Argentina in fourth quarter 2007. In first quarter 2010, the Company transferred certain intermediates product lines from the Performance Polymers segment, now included in discontinued operations, to the PCI segment to improve optimization of manufacturing assets supporting the three raw material streams that supply the Companys downstream businesses. Segment sales and operating results for prior years have been reclassified for the change. Sales revenue for 2009 decreased $1.0 billion compared to 2008. Excluding contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement resulting from the divestiture of the Performance Polymers segments PE business in fourth quarter 2006 and contract polymer intermediates sales to the buyer of the divested Mexico and Argentina PET facilities, sales revenue decreased $621 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower selling prices. The lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material and energy costs. 56 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Excluding accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and other operating income, operating earnings in 2009 decreased $114 million compared to 2008. The decline was primarily due to lower selling prices and lower capacity utilization resulting in higher unit costs, including approximately $15 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility, partially offset by lower raw material and energy costs and cost reduction actions. A restructuring charge in first quarter 2009 consisted of the segments portion of the severance charge for a reduction in force. Asset impairments and restructuring charges in 2008 consisted primarily of severance and pension costs from the decision to close a previously impaired site in the United Kingdom. The accelerated depreciation costs for 2008 are related to the continuation of the planned stag ed phase out of older cracking units in 2007 at the Companys Longview, Texas facility. To further improve its competitive cost position over purchasing olefins in the North American market, the Company restarted a previously idled cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility in 2010. This restart was prompted by a favorable shift in market conditions for olefin raw materials that is expected to continue over the next several years. The Company has three operating cracking units, including the unit restarted in 2010. Specialty Plastics Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 $ % Sales $ 749 $ 923 $ (174) (19) % Volume effect (91) (10) % Price effect (66) (7) % Product mix effect (23) (3) % Exchange rate effect 6 1 % Operating earnings 9 30 (21) (70) % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 4 4 Other operating income (2) 2 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net and other operating income 13 28 (15) (54) % Sales revenue for 2009 decreased $174 million compared to 2008 due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices. The decline in sales volume was attributed to the global recession which has weakened demand for plastic resins, including copolyester products sold into the consumer and durable goods markets, and for cellulosic plastics sold into various markets. The lower selling prices were a result of lower raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene. Excluding the segments portion of a severance charge for a reduction in force in first quarter 2009 and other operating income related to the sale of certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site in 2008, operating earnings for 2009 decreased $15 million compared to 2008 due to lower sales volume, lower capacity utilization resulting in higher unit costs, an unfavorable shift in product mix with less cellulosic plastics sold into various markets, and lower selling prices, partially offset by lower raw material and energy costs and cost reduction actions. 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 2,252 $ 3,308 (32) % (19) % (14) % 1 % % Asia Pacific 1,062 1,186 (10) % (1) % (5) % (4) % % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 835 1,045 (20) % (16) % (1) % (4) % 1 % Latin America 247 397 (38) % (31) % (12) % 5 % % $ 4,396 $ 5,936 (26) % (16) % (10) % % % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices particularly in the PCI segment partially due to contract ethylene sales in the PCI segment. Excluding contract ethylene sales, sales revenue decreased 26 percent primarily due to lower selling prices particularly in the PCI segment and lower sales volume particularly in the CASPI and PCI segments. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower selling prices in the PCI, Specialty Plastics, and CASPI segments partially offset by higher selling prices in the Fibers segment and an unfavorable shift in product mix, particularly in the CASPI and Specialty Plastics segments. The unfavorable shift in product mix was due to the CASPI segment pursuing favorable market conditions for solvent product lines resulting in a lower average selling price, while the Specialty Plastics segment sold less cellulosic plastics into various markets. The region experienced less of a sales volume decrease as a result of stronger PCI segment volume in 2009 due to raw material supply issues restricting production in 2008 and increased sales volume in the CASPI segment. Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume and an unfavorable shift in product mix in all segments. The region had minimal price effect change compared to significant declines in other regions due to the higher selling prices in the Fibers segment and fewer sales from commodity product lines. Sales revenue in Latin America decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix. Lower selling prices were primarily in the PCI segment. Lower sales volume and the favorable shift in product mix were primarily related to contract polymer intermediates sales in 2008 and not in 2009, with the lower sales volume partially offset by increased sales volume in the CASPI segment. Excluding contract polymer intermediates sales, sales revenue decreased 5 percent. 58 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash Flows (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 575 $ 758 $ 653 Investing activities (442) (369) (376) Financing activities (411) 18 (779) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 (1) 1 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (277) $ 406 $ (501) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 516 $ 793 $ 387 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 575 $ 758 $ 653 Impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance (1) 200 Net cash provided by operating activities excluding item 775 758 653 Additions to properties and equipment (243) (310) (634) Dividends paid to stockholders (127) (128) (135) Free Cash Flow $ 405 $ 320 $ (116) (1) The net cash from operating activities in 2010 reflected the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which resulted in $200 million of receivables, which were previously accounted for as sold and removed from the balance sheet when transferred under the accounts receivable securitization program, being included on the first quarter balance sheet as trade receivables, net. This increase in receivables reduced cash from operations by $200 million in first quarter 2010. Excluding the impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Companys accounts receivable securitization program, cash provided by operating activities increased $17 million to $775 million in 2010. The higher cash provided in 2010 was primarily due to higher net earnings, partially offset by an increase in working capital, particularly trade receivables and inventories, offset by higher trade payables. Trade receivables increased due to strong sales revenues throughout the year and inventories increased due to higher quantities attributed to improved demand for the Companys products and higher costs. Both the increase in receivables and inventory were partially offset by an increase in accounts payab le driven by a higher level of purchasing activity. The 2009 operating cash flows were positively impacted by approximately $125 million due to a change in the tax method for capitalizing assets. Cash provided by operating activities increased $105 million to $758 million in 2009. The 2009 operating cash flow includes cash generated by a change in the tax method for capitalizing assets of approximately $125 million and a reduction in working capital of $118 million partially offset by a $181 million contribution to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The change in tax method accelerated timing of deductions for manufacturing repairs expense resulting in lower estimated tax payments and a refund of previously paid taxes. The reduced working capital primarily resulted from inventory reductions in all segments in response to the lower level of economic activity. End of year receivables remained constant between 2009 and 2008 which is consistent with the declines in fourth quart er revenues. Trade payables increased because of a higher level of purchasing activity at the end of 2009 versus the recessionary levels at the end of 2008. Operating cash flow in 2008 also included the monetization of interest rate, commodity, and foreign exchange hedges. 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cash used in investing activities, primarily for capital spending for additions to properties and equipment, was $243 million, $310 million, and $634 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Cash used in investing activities in 2010 includes the acquisition of Genovique and payments for the acquisition of the Korean acetate tow facility. Capital spending of $243 million in 2010 was lower compared to $310 million in 2009 primarily due to the deferral of discretionary spending in response to the global recession compared to 2009 which included the completion of large growth initiatives. In 2009, the Company contributed $68 million for the construction of the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility which is reported in "acquisitions of and investments in joint ventures". The Company received approximately $25 million net cash proceeds in 2009 primarily from the settlement of working capital from the sale in 2008 of the Companys PET polymers and PTA manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands and the PET manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. In 2008, the Company received $337 million net cash proceeds primarily from the sale of the Companys PET polymers and PTA manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands and the PET manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. For more information concerning divestitures, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale" and Note 3, "Acquisitions", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Cash used in financing activities totaled $411 million in 2010, including the early repayment of $500 million principal amount of its outstanding long term debt and $280 million of share repurchases, offset by net proceeds from long term borrowings of $496 million and stock option exercises and other items of $118 million. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $18 million in 2009. Financing activities in 2009 included $248 million of net proceeds from the issuance of notes due 2019, a repayment of $88 million of the Companys euro credit facility, and a repayment of $13 million of short term borrowings. The Company also repurchased stock totaling $21 million offset by cash received from stock option exercises and other items of $17 million. Cash used in financing activities totaled $779 million in 2008. Financing activities in 2008 included the Companys repayment of $72 million of notes that matured in 2008, a repayment of $103 million of the euro credit facility, a decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $7 million, and repurchases of stock totaling $501 million offset by cash received from stock option exercises and other items of $39 million. The payment of dividends is also reflected in financing activities in all periods. Excluding the cash tax impact of the sale of its PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment, the Company expects to generate positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends) in 2011 of approximately $100 million, assuming capital expenditures of approximately $450 million and U.S. defined benefit pension plan funding of $100 million. The priorities for uses of available cash in 2011 are payment of the quarterly cash dividend, funding targeted growth initiatives, including organic initiatives, joint ventures and acquisitions, pension funding, and repurchasing shares primarily to offset dilution. Liquidity At December 31, 2010, the Company had a $700 million revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") in two tranches, with $125 million expiring in 2012 and $575 million expiring in 2013. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a facility fee is paid on the total commitment. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Given the expiration dates of the Credit Facility, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long term borrowings because the Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis. 60 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Additionally, at December 31, 2010, the Company also had a $200 million line of credit under its annually renewable accounts receivable securitization agreement ("A/R Facility"). The A/R Facility was renewed in July 2010. Borrowings under the A/R Facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lenders borrowing costs, and the Company pays a fee to maintain availability of the A/R Facility. In addition, the A/R Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2010, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the A/R Facility. For more information, see Note 10, "Borrowings " and Note 14, "Commitments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new five and ten year debt securities and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long term debt. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. See Note 10, "Borrowings" and Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding debt issuance and extinguishment. On November 2, 2009, the Company issued notes in the principal amount of $250 million due 2019 and bearing interest at 5.50% per annum. Proceeds from the sale of notes, net of approximately $2 million in transaction fees, were $248 million. For more information regarding interest rates, see Note 10, "Borrowings", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. In 2010 and 2009, the Company made $35 million and $181 million, respectively, in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and made no contribution in 2008. In January 2011, the Company made a $100 million contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Cash flows from operations and the other sources of liquidity described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However, the Companys cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastmans products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $243 million, $310 million, and $634 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2009 decreased significantly compared to 2008 as the Company deferred discretionary spending on capital projects in response to the global recession. Capital expenditures remained at a level sufficient for required maintenance and certain strategic growth initiatives through first nine months 2010. In fourth quarter 2010, the Company increased spending on discretionary infrastructure projects and certain strategic growth initiatives to $110 million for the quarter. The Company expects that 2011 capital spending will continue at the fourth quarter 2010 pace and will be approximately $450 million. The Companys capital spending in 2011 will focus on organic growth init iatives, particularly in the Specialty Plastics, CASPI, and PCI segments. The Company expects 2011 depreciation and amortization to be slightly lower than 2010 expenses of approximately $280 million, primarily due to the divestiture of PET manufacturing facilities in January 2011. 61 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Commitments At December 31, 2010, the Companys obligations related to notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.6 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 20 years. The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2010 totaling approximately $1.0 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month to month operating leases totaling $86 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 15 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; and approximately 35 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2010 totaling approximately $1.5 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other post employment obligations, and environmental reserves. The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Payments Due for Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities (a) Total 2011 $ 6 $ $ 87 $ 266 $ 24 $ 296 $ 679 2012 151 87 265 24 51 578 2013 81 239 13 53 386 2014 81 37 6 54 178 2015 250 82 36 4 55 427 2016 and beyond 1,197 528 118 15 969 2,827 Total $ 1,604 $ $ 946 $ 961 $ 86 $ 1,478 $ 5,075 (a) Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post employment benefits and taxes payable in the periods indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it has guaranteed a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2010 totaled $160 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars and company aircraft. Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $11 million, $139 million, and $10 million will expire in 2011, 2012, and 2014 and beyond, respectively. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. 62 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As described in Note 7, "Equity Investments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastmans Kingsport, Tennessee plant. This investment is accounted for under the equity method. Eastmans net investment in the joint venture at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $32 million and $36 million, respectively, which was comprised of the recognized portion of the ventures accumulated deficits, long term amounts owed to Primester, and a line of credit from Eastman to Primester. The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. The accounting guidance on consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") is effective for all VIEs or potential VIEs the Company is involved with on or after January 1, 2010. This guidance amends the evaluation criteria to identify which entity has a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments. The Company has evaluated its material contractual relationships under this new guidance and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not VIEs or, in the case of Primester, a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the Companys Kingsport, Tennessee plant, the Company has shared control of the VIE. As such, the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. Non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, managemen t does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or liquidity. Treasury Stock Transactions In October 2007, the Board of Directors authorized $700 million for repurchase of the Companys outstanding common stock. The Company completed the $700 million repurchase authorization in November 2010, acquiring a total of 11.2 million shares. In August 2010, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. As of December 31, 2010, a total of 2.3 million shares have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of approximately $184 million. During 2010, the Company repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $280 million under the two repurchase authorizations. In February 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. Dividends The Companys Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share in first, second, and third quarters and $0.47 per share in fourth quarter 2010 for a total of $1.79 per share in 2010, and $0.44 per share for all quarters, for a total of $1.76 per share in 2009, and 2008. The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.47 per share during the first quarter of 2011, payable on April 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2011. 63 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordan ce with Eastmans policies as described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Companys preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chem ical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $10 million to the maximum of $27 million at December 31, 2010. In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure and postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. The best estimate accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs is $30 million at December 31, 2010. GAAP requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation ("CARO") when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company has performed an examination of various asset categories as of December 31, 2010. Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as w ell as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 64 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately 75 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2010. Currently, the Companys environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next 50 years. If the Company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. The Companys cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $200 million, $173 million, and $218 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included expenditures for construction and development. Other than potential capital expenditures at the Companys Kingsport, Tennessee facility related to regulations associated with controlling air emissions from boilers, the Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Companys planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Potential capi tal expenditures associated with boiler air emissions remain uncertain pending adoption of final regulations, but could increase average annual capital expenditures significantly over the next five years compared to recent historical levels depending on financial regulation requirements and the Companys method of addressing those requirements. INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastmans costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market price fluctuations. The volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit. For additional information see Note 12, "Derivatives", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUTLOOK The Company expects to benefit from a strengthening global economy and from the combination of the restart of an olefin cracking unit, lower interest expense, full year integration of the Genovique acquisition and Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility, strong market adoption of the TritanTM copolyester products, continued substitution of Eastman products for other materials, and new applications for existing products. The Company expects the volatility of market prices for raw materials and energy to continue and that the Company will continue to use pricing and hedging strategies to offset this volatility, and for raw material and energy costs to be higher than 2010. The Company expects to continue with growth initiatives in all segments, as well as to continue to explore and invest in R&D initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally friendly chemistry. The Company expects capital spending to be approximately $450 million for required maintenance, organic growth initiatives, and environmental projects. The Company expects to generate more than $100 million of positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends, excluding the projected cash taxes on gain from the sale of the PET business of the Performance Polymers segment). 65 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Based upon the foregoing, the Company expects full year earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011, excluding gains from sales of assets, to be slightly more than 10 percent above 2010 earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.96 excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, net and early debt extinguishment costs. See "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this Annual Report which are not statements of historical fact may be "forward looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These statements, and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply an d demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans and activities; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated restructuring, acquisition, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; integration of any acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the underlying assumptions are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the most significant known factors that c ould cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statement. Additional factors not presently known to the Company, or that the Company does not currently believe to be material, may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Adverse and uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company. While economic and financial market conditions improved in 2010, continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect the Companys results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Companys business and operating results were affected by the impact of the recent global recession, including the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that affected the global economy. If the global economy again deteriorates, the Companys results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. If the global economy weakens, or if the global economy or financial markets experience significant new disruptions or deterioration, the Companys ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained, which may negatively impact the Companys liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives. 66 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results. The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. These risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations. In addition, natural disasters, plant interruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities. The Company could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to manufacturing operations or related infrastructure. Significant limitation of the Companys ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Companys sales revenue, costs, results of operations, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction, operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as natural disasters, pandemic illness, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. Loss or financial weakness of any of the Companys largest customers could adversely affect our financial results. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of our largest customers could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives. The Company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both internal (or "organic") development and acquisitions and joint ventures to diversify and extend the portfolio of our businesses. These growth opportunities include development and commercialization of new products and technologies, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, and alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Companys portfolio of businesses and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances will result in financially successful commercialization of products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Companys results of oper ations. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed investments and projects. 67 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Legislative or regulatory actions could increase the Companys future compliance costs. The Companys facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. The Companys accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or c hanges in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Pending and proposed U.S. Federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the Companys manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs. In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents managements best judgment as of the date the information is given.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Eastman Chemical Company and subsidiaries ("Eastman" or the "Company") are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations. To mitigate the Companys exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. From time to time, to manage the mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, the Company enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. Currently, these borrowings, investments, and swaps are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates. For 2010 and 2009, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately $123 million and $120 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates. The Companys operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies; and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Companys policy to enter into fore ign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. For 2010, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $60 million and an additional $6 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. For 2009, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $51 million and an additional $5 million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated for eign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy. To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, natural gas, and ethane, the Company enters into option and forward contracts. For 2010, the market risk associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $6 million and less than an additional $1 million for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. For 2009, the market risk associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $4 million and less than an additional $1 million for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. 69
