All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In third quarter 2011, the Companys Board of Directors declared a two for one split of the Companys common stock, distributed October 3, 2011 in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. All shares and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted for all periods presented for the stock split. For additional information, see Note 17, "Stockholders Equity" to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 34 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Companys management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, income taxes, and purchase accounting. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Companys management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Companys financial condition and results. These estimates require managements most significant judgments in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results is low. However, if one of the Companys key customers was to file for bankruptcy, or otherwise be unwilling or unable to make its required payments, or there was a significant slow down in the economy, the Company could increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings. The Companys allowances were $8 million and $5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing. Reporting units are identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of goodwill, additional steps, including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, would be necessary to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") and Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segments. The Company also had recorded goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. In fourth quarter 2009, the Company announced the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project, which resulted in an impairment of the Beaumont industrial gasification project goodwill and other intangible assets. As the Companys assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change, additional write downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recognized a definite lived intangible asset impairment charge of $8 million resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting the fair value of air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas, industrial gasification project. The Company recognized fixed (tangible) asset impairment charges of $133 million and goodwill and definite lived intangible asset impairment charges of $46 million in results from continuing operations during 2009, related to the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $29 million at December 31, 2011. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as defined by GAAP, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years. If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The Companys reserve, including the above remediation, was $39 million at December 31, 2011 and $40 million at December 31, 2010, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs. Pension and Other Post employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides a subsidy toward life insurance, health care, and dental benefits for eligible retirees and a subsidy toward health care and dental benefits for retirees eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets. In connection with its acquisition of Sterling Chemicals, Inc. ("Sterling") in 2011, the Company assumed Sterlings U.S. pension plans. At December 31, 2011, the Company assumed discount rates of 4.88 percent and 4.83 percent on the defined benefit pension plans, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets of 8.75 percent and 5.50 percent, respectively. The Company assumed a discount rate of 5.00 percent on its other post employment benefit plan. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. 36 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The December 31, 2011 projected benefit obligation and 2012 expense are affected by year end 2011 assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Companys long term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for all U.S. pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. Change in Assumption Impact on 2012 Pre tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2011 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plans Impact on December 31, 2011 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$6 Million +$49 Million +$27 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $6 Million $47 Million $26 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$3 Million No Impact N/A 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $3 Million No Impact N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Companys pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, private equity, and real estate markets. Historically, over a ten year period, excluding 2008 which is considered an anomaly due to the global recession, the Companys average achieved actual return has been near the expected return on assets. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations. As future benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations. The Company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets, which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years. If actual experience differs from these long term assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2011, 2010, and 2009 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $69 million, $56 million, and $45 million, respectively. 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during 2012 will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2012. However, an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, as of December 31, 2012 for the impact on the pensions projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations, see Note 13, "Retirement Plans", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Based upon facts and information currently available, the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against earnings in particular periods. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome from future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2011, a valuation allowance of $42 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. The Company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision. Purchase Accounting In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. The Company estimates fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets. Managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Companys results of operations. 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRESENTATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the following non GAAP financial measures and accompanying reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Company and segment operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains described below; Company earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs described below; Cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and the impact of a tax payment for the gain on the sale of the polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") business, described below; and Free cash flow (as defined), described below. During 2011, the Company recognized $7 million in restructuring charges primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling and a $15 million gain from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. Also during 2011, cash flows included the use of $110 million for a tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. During 2010, the Company recognized $29 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges consisting of $20 million in severance and pension curtailment, $8 million for an intangible asset impairment resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project, and $1 million of additional site closure charges. During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring including the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. During first quarter 2010, the Company adopted amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Companys $200 million accounts receivable securitization program. For periods beginning after December 31, 2009, transfers of receivables interests that were previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet are included in trade receivables, net, and reflected as secured borrowings on the balance sheet. The Companys Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2010 reflects an increase in trade receivables of $200 million, the amount transferred at December 31, 2009 under the securitization program, which reduced cash flows from operating activities by that amount for 2010. During 2009, the Company recognized $196 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges, primarily consisting of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Companys previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force. 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and the impact on the Company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs, to improve the profitability of the Company, and favorably adjust its debt maturities and cost, Eastmans management believes that Company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with and without asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs. Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported Company and segment results, respectively, without the identified items. In addition, management believes that cash provided by and used in operating activities should be considered both with and without the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and the tax payment for the gain on the sale of the PET business, and dividends and capital expenditures. Management utilizes Company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance based compensation. These measures, excluding the identified items, are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance. 2011 OVERVIEW The Company generated sales revenue of $7.2 billion and $5.8 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Sales revenue increases were primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily for propane, paraxylene, and wood pulp. The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in PCI segment plasticizer product lines, the fourth quarter 2010 restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility, and strengthened end use demand primarily for CASPI segment products. The increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased utilization of the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility and the Eastman TritanTM copolyester resin manufacturing line, and the acquisition of the Genovique Specialties Corporation ("Genovique") plasticizer product lines. Operating earnings were $1,021 million in 2011 compared to $862 million in 2010. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, described above in "Presentation of Non GAAP Financial Measures", operating earnings increased primarily due to higher selling prices which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and higher sales volume and increased capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs, particularly in the first half of the year. Operating earnings in 2011 also included $17 million of costs from an unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility. Earnings from continuing operations were $657 million in 2011 compared to $425 million in 2010. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings from continuing operations were $652 million and $514 million, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations were $4.59 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $2.88 per diluted share in 2010. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings were $4.56 per diluted share and $3.48 per diluted share, respectively. Eastman generated $625 million in cash from operating activities in 2011, including $102 million in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the $110 million tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of the tax payment and the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets described above in "Presentation of Non GAAP Financial Measures", cash provided by operating activities decreased $40 million to $735 million in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital and higher cash payments for employee pension and incentive pay plans during the year, which were partially offset by higher net earnings. Excluding the tax payment, the Company generated free cash flow of $142 million for full year 2011. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In 2011 and early 2012, the Company completed and progressed on both organic (internal growth) and inorganic (external growth through joint venture and acquisition) growth initiatives: In the PCI segment, the Company completed several initiatives in 2011 to expand its non phthalate plasticizer business, including the acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex do Brasil S.A. Indstrias Qumicas ("Scandiflex"). The acquired Sterling idled plasticizer manufacturing unit is being retrofitted to produce non phthalate plasticizers, with the first of two phases expected to be online in the first half of 2012. The Company also plans to increase capacity of 2 ethyl hexanol in first half 2012 to support expected growth in the plasticizers, coatings, and fuel additive markets. In the Specialty Plastics segment, the Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity at its facility in Kingsport, Tennessee for TritanTM copolyester polymer, which is expected to be operational in early 2012. The Company is expanding its capacity for cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM"), a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters, in two phases with the first operational in fourth quarter 2011 and the second expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. The Company is also expanding its cellulose triacetate capacity, with the new capacity expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. In the CASPI segment, the Company completed an additional 20 percent expansion of its hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity in Middelburg, the Netherlands, and an additional 10 percent debottleneck of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon facility in Longview, Texas in 2011. The Company also acquired Dynaloy, LLC ("Dynaloy") in 2011 as part of its electronic materials growth initiative. In the Fibers segment, in 2011 the Company entered into a joint venture for a 30,000 metric ton acetate tow manufacturing facility in China, expected to be operational in mid 2013. The Company continues to explore and invest in research and development ("R&D") initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally friendly chemistry. These initiatives include the completion of a demonstration facility for market testing of acetylated wood, branded as Perennial WoodTM, in second half 2011 and commercial introduction in first quarter 2012 to select markets; the initial commercial introduction of the new Eastman CerfisTM technology, with anticipation that the application will be expanded nationwide by the end of 2012; and the announcement of the new EastmanTM microfiber technology. On January 26, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia Inc. ("Solutia"), a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals. Under the terms of the agreement, Solutia stockholders will receive $22.00 in cash and 0.12 shares of Eastman common stock for each share of Solutia common stock, a total transaction value of approximately $4.7 billion, as of January 26, 2012, including the assumption of Solutias debt. The transaction remains subject to approval by Solutias shareholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals as well as other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in mid 2012. The acquisition of Solutia is expected to: o broaden Eastmans global presence, particularly in Asia Pacific; o establish a combined platform with extensive organic growth opportunities through complementary technologies and business capabilities and an overlap of key end markets; and o expand Eastmans portfolio of sustainable products. In first quarter 2011, the Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP. The total cash proceeds of the transaction were $615 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations as presented in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report are summarized and analyzed below. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % 2010 2009 % Sales $ 7,178 $ 5,842 23 % $ 5,842 $ 4,396 33 % Volume effect 7 % 19 % Price effect 14 % 10 % Product mix effect 2 % 4 % Exchange rate effect % % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 compared to 2010 increased $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments (particularly in the PCI segment) and higher sales volume primarily in the PCI segment. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily for propane, paraxylene, and wood pulp. The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in PCI segment plasticizer product lines, the fourth quarter 2010 restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility, and strengthened end use demand primarily for CASPI segment products. The increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased utilization of the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility and the Eastman TritanTM copolyester resin manufacturing line, and the acquisition of the Genovique plasticizer product lines. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 compared to 2009 increased $1.4 billion. The sales revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in all segments attributed to improved end use demand in packaging, durable goods, and other markets, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives. Sales revenue increases were also due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily in the PCI and CASPI segments. 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change 2010 2009 Change Gross Profit $ 1,640 $ 1,474 11 % $ 1,474 $ 1,032 43 % As a percentage of sales 23 % 25 % 25 % 23 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Gross profit for 2011 increased compared with 2010 in all segments. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher selling prices, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and higher sales volume and increased capacity utilization, which led to lower unit costs, particularly in the first half of the year. Gross profit in 2011 included $17 million of costs from an unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility. 42 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Compared to 2009 Gross profit for 2010 increased compared with 2009 in all segments. The increase was due to higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs. In addition, higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Gross profit in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue. In first quarter 2010, the Company experienced a power outage at its Longview, Texas manufacturing facility. Costs related to the outage were mostly offset by the settlement of the related insurance claim. Gross profit in 2009 included approximately $20 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. The reconfiguration costs impacted the PCI and CASPI segments. 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change 2010 2009 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 469 $ 431 9 % $ 431 $ 367 17 % Research and Development Expenses 158 152 4 % 152 124 23 % $ 627 $ 583 8 % $ 583 $ 491 19 % As a percentage of sales 9 % 10 % 10 % 11 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased compensation expense and higher costs of growth and business development initiatives. Research and development expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher R&D expenses for growth initiatives. 2010 Compared to 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased performance based compensation expense and higher discretionary spending, including expenses for growth initiatives. Research and development expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher R&D expenses for growth initiatives. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges (Gains), Net In 2011, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net gains of $8 million. A gain of $15 million was recognized from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and restructuring charges of $7 million were primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling. In 2010, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net charges of $29 million and consisted primarily of severance and pension curtailment charges and an intangible asset impairment. Severance charges of $18 million included $15 million for the previously announced voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010 and $3 million primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Genovique in second quarter 2010. Restructuring charges of $2 million for pension curtailment are also related to the voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010. The intangible asset impairment of $8 million resulted from an environmental regulatory change impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project in fourth quarter 2010. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In 2009, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net charges of $196 million and consisted of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Companys previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force.

For 2012, the Company expects net interest expense to remain consistent with 2011, excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net interest expense increased $21 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower capitalized interest resulting from lower capital spending and higher average borrowings. Early Debt Extinguishment Costs During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new debt securities with maturities five and ten years from issuance and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long term debt. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 44 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Charges (Income), Net (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Foreign exchange transaction (gains) losses, net $ (2 ) $ 8 $ 5 Investment (gains) losses, net (16 ) (1 ) 5 Other, net (1 ) 5 3 Other charges (income), net $ (19 ) $ 12 $ 13 Included in other charges (income), net are gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions, results from equity investments, gains or losses on business venture investments, gains from the sale of non operating assets, certain litigation costs, fees on securitized receivables, other non operating income, and other miscellaneous items.

Provision for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change 2010 2009 Change Provision for income taxes from continuing operations $ 307 $ 211 45 % $ 211 $ 100 &gt;100 % Effective tax rate 32 % 33 % 33 % 39 % The 2011 effective tax rate reflects an $8 million tax benefit recognized due to an increased level of capital investment which qualified for additional state tax credits. The 2010 effective tax rate reflected a $9 million tax charge associated with a nondeductible, early distribution under the executive deferred compensation plan of previously earned compensation as a result of certain participants electing early withdrawal. The 2009 effective tax rate reflected an $11 million tax charge associated with the recapture of gasification investment tax credits, a $7 million tax charge associated with a change in accounting method for tax purposes to accelerate timing of deductions for manufacturing repairs expense and a $5 million tax benefit from the reversal of tax reserves due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2012 will be approximately 33 percent, excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) $ EPS $ EPS $ EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 657 $ 4.59 $ 425 $ 2.88 $ 154 $ 1.05 Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net of tax (5 ) (0.03 ) 18 0.12 127 0.86 Early debt extinguishment costs, net of tax 71 0.48 Earnings from continuing operations excluding items $ 652 $ 4.56 $ 514 $ 3.48 $ 281 $ 1.91 Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) $ EPS $ EPS $ EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 657 $ 4.59 $ 425 $ 2.88 $ 154 $ 1.05 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 8 0.06 13 0.08 (18 ) (0.12 ) Gain from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax 31 0.21 Net earnings $ 696 $ 4.86 $ 438 $ 2.96 $ 136 $ 0.93 Earnings of $8 million and $13 million and a loss of $18 million, net of tax in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, resulted from discontinued operations of the PET business of the Performance Polymers segment. Corporate costs which were allocated to the Performance Polymers segment have been reallocated to other segments in the Companys financial statements. For additional information, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Companys products and operations are currently managed and reported in four reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the PCI segment, and the Specialty Plastics segment. For additional information concerning the Companys operating businesses and products, see Note 22, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. In first quarter 2011, the Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP. For additional information, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales revenue and expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 22, "Segment Information", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, as "other" sales revenue and operating losses. As discussed in Note 22, these "other" operating losses are $50 million, $66 million, and $218 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Included in 2011 is a $15 million gain from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. Included in 2010 and 2009 are $8 million and $179 million, respectively, in asset impairments related to the discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. CASPI Segment 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Change Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 $ % 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,844 $ 1,574 $ 270 17 % $ 1,574 $ 1,217 $ 357 29 % Volume effect 79 5 % 198 16 % Price effect 197 13 % 122 10 % Product mix effect (11) (1) % 43 4 % Exchange rate effect 5 % (6) (1) % Operating earnings 331 293 38 13 % 293 221 72 33 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 6 (6) 6 3 3 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 331 299 32 11 % 299 224 75 34 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs and were also attributed to strengthened demand, particularly in the U.S., and tight industry supply particularly in the first half of the year. The higher sales volume was attributed primarily to strengthened end use demand in the packaging, durable goods, and transportation markets, particularly in the U.S. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices, higher sales volume, and the increased benefits from cracking propane to produce low cost propylene, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. In 2011, operating earnings included $5 million of costs from the unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit. The restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices. The higher sales volume was attributed to strengthened end use demand in the packaging and transportation markets primarily in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa and the United States and Canada regions, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, and the positive impact of growth initiatives, including the hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity expansion in Middelburg, the Netherlands which was completed in fourth quarter 2009. The higher selling prices were primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for propane. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume, higher capacity utilization, which led to lower unit costs, and higher selling prices, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings in 2009 included approximately $5 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. Growth Initiatives The Company is progressing on both organic and inorganic growth initiatives in the CASPI segment. The segment is meeting growing demand for specialty hydrocarbon resins by completing two capacity expansions in 2011: an additional expansion in Middelburg, the Netherlands and a debottleneck in Longview, Texas. In 2011, CASPI expanded its presence in the electronic materials market through the acquisition of Dynaloy and its formulated cleaners business. Fibers Segment 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Change Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 $ % 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,279 $ 1,142 $ 137 12 % $ 1,142 $ 1,032 $ 110 11 % Volume effect 35 3 % 61 6 % Price effect 46 4 % 4 % Product mix effect 55 5 % 46 5 % Exchange rate effect 1 % (1) % Operating earnings 346 323 23 7 % 323 292 31 11 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 3 (3) 3 4 (1) Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 346 326 20 6 % 326 296 30 10 % 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix, higher selling prices, and higher sales volume. The favorable shift in product mix was mainly due to higher acetate tow sales volume resulting from increased utilization of the recently completed acetate tow manufacturing facility in Korea. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher acetate tow sales volume in Asia Pacific and Europe and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. The restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and a favorable shift in product mix. The higher sales volume and favorable shift in product mix were due to higher sales volume of acetate tow and of acetate yarn, both attributed to strengthened demand due to the global economic recovery. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume for acetate tow and acetate yarn, improved acetyl stream capacity utilization and a favorable shift in product mix. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. Growth Initiatives The Company has entered into a joint venture for a 30,000 metric ton acetate tow manufacturing facility in China. The facility is expected to be operational in mid 2013. Eastman has 45 percent ownership of the joint venture and expects to provide 100 percent of the acetate flake raw material to the joint venture from the Companys manufacturing facility in Kingsport. During first quarter 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of and commenced production at the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility. The facility was operating at full production beginning in fourth quarter 2010. PCI Segment 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Change Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 $ % 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 2,860 $ 2,083 $ 777 37 % $ 2,083 1,398 $ 685 49 % Volume effect 289 14 % 333 24 % Price effect 392 19 % 295 21 % Product mix effect 89 4 % 58 4 % Exchange rate effect 7 % (1) % Operating earnings 289 224 65 29 % 224 41 183 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 7 7 7 6 1 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 296 231 65 28 % 231 47 184 &gt;100 % 49 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. The increased selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs and also attributed to strengthened demand in North America and tight industry supply, particularly for olefin derivative product lines in the first half of the year. The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in plasticizer product lines, which included the acquired Genovique plasticizer product lines, particularly in North America and Europe, and the restart of the previously idled Longview, Texas olefins cracking unit. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings in 2011 increased compared to 2010 due to higher selling prices, higher sales volume, and the increased benefits from cracking propane to produce low cost propylene, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. The operating earnings increase was primarily in North America. In 2011, operating earnings included $8 million from the acetyl technology license and costs of $11 million from the unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility. In 2010, operating earnings included $12 million from the acetyl technology license. In 2011, operating earnings included $7 million in restructuring charges, primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling. In 2010, the restructuring charges reflect the segments portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices. The higher sales volume included growth in plasticizer product lines, both in heritage products as well as in product lines added with the acquisition of Genovique plasticizer product lines, and also attributed to strengthened end use demand due to the global economic recovery. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings in 2010 increased compared to 2009 due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs, higher sales volume, and increased capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs. Operating earnings in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. Operating results in 2009 included approximately $15 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. Growth Initiatives The Company completed several initiatives to expand its non phthalate plasticizer business, including the acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex in 2011 and Genovique in 2010. In third quarter 2011, the Company acquired Sterling, a single site North American petrochemical producer. The acquisition of Sterling will allow an idled plasticizer unit to be retrofitted to produce non phthalate plasticizers, with the first of two phases expected to be online in the first half of 2012 and the second phase to be determined at a later date based on demand. Also, in third quarter 2011, the Company acquired Scandiflex, a manufacturer of plasticizers located in So Paulo, Brazil. In second quarter 2010, the Company acquired Genovique, a global producer of specialty non phthalate plasticizers for water based adhesives and other applications. The acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex in 2011 and Genovique in 2010 added to the Companys portfolio of non phthalate plasticizers that serve high growth markets. The Company also plans to increase capacity of 2 ethyl hexanol in first half 2012 to support expected growth in the plasticizers, coatings, and fuel additive markets. To further improve its competitive cost position over purchasing olefins in the North American market, the Company restarted a previously idled cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility in 2010. This restart was prompted by a favorable shift in market conditions for olefins raw materials that is expected to continue over the next several years. The Company has three operating cracking units as well as a fourth cracking unit which is currently shutdown. 50 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Specialty Plastics Segment 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Change Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 $ % 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,195 $ 1,043 $ 152 15 % $ 1,043 $ 749 $ 294 39 % Volume effect (23) (2) % 240 32 % Price effect 161 16 % 14 2 % Product mix effect 11 1 % 37 5 % Exchange rate effect 3 % 3 % Operating earnings 105 88 17 19 % 88 9 79 &gt;100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 5 (5) 5 4 1 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 105 93 12 13 % 93 13 80 &gt;100 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices. Selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene. Slightly lower sales volume was attributed to weakened demand for copolyester product lines, particularly in packaging and consumer durable goods end markets, and some customer shift to other plastic materials that do not use paraxylene as a raw material. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs and the positive impact of the Eastman Tritan copolyester growth initiative. Restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume. The higher sales volume was attributed to improved end use demand across all markets, in part due to the global economic recovery, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives for core copolyesters and the TritanTM copolyester product lines. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume, resulting in higher capacity utilization and lower unit costs. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segments portion of severance charges. 51 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Growth Initiatives The Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity at its facility in Kingsport, Tennessee for TritanTM copolyester polymer, which is expected to be operational in early 2012. The Company is expanding its capacity for CHDM, a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters, in two phases with the first operational in fourth quarter 2011 and the second expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. The Company is also expanding its cellulose triacetate capacity, with the new capacity expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. Eastman expects that the overall segment decrease in sales volume, particularly in second half 2011, is a temporary slowdown and expects growth to resume in the long term. The monomer manufacturing facility and the first Eastman TritanTM copolyester resin manufacturing line in Kingsport, Tennessee commenced production in first quarter 2010. SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2011 COMPARED WITH 2010 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 3,824 $ 2,957 29 % 10 % 17 % 2 % % Asia Pacific 1,681 1,446 16 % 2 % 10 % 4 % % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,352 1,150 18 % 5 % 11 % 1 % 1 % Latin America 321 289 11 % (2) % 12 % 1 % % $ 7,178 $ 5,842 23 % 7 % 14 % 2 % % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume, particularly in the PCI segment. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments, and a favorable shift in product mix and higher sales volume, primarily in the Fibers segment. The sales volume increase was less than other regions due to lower sales volume in the Specialty Plastics segment offsetting increases in the other segments. Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments and higher sales volume, particularly in the PCI segment. Sales revenue in Latin America increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly in the PCI and CASPI segments. Lower sales volume was primarily due to sales being directed to other regions. With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars or euros. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For additional information concerning these practices, see Note 12, "Derivatives", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 52 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 2,957 $ 2,252 31 % 19 % 12 % % % Asia Pacific 1,446 1,062 36 % 18 % 10 % 7 % 1 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,150 835 38 % 23 % 5 % 12 % (2) % Latin America 289 247 17 % 9 % 7 % 1 % % $ 5,842 $ 4,396 33 % 19 % 10 % 4 % % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volumes in all segments, particularly the PCI segment, and higher selling prices in all segments except the Fibers segment. Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume particularly in the Specialty Plastics segments, higher selling prices in all segments, and a favorable shift in product mix in all segments. Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and a favorable shift in product mix in all segments. The region had minimal price effect change compared to other regions due to fewer sales from commodity product lines. Sales revenue in Latin America increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices in all segments. LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash Flows (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 625 $ 575 $ 758 Investing activities (142) (442) (369) Financing activities (423) (411) 18 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 1 (1) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ (277) $ 406 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 577 $ 516 $ 793 53 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 625 $ 575 $ 758 Impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance (1) 200 Impact of tax payment on the sale of the PET business(2) 110 Net cash provided by operating activities excluding items 735 775 758 Additions to properties and equipment (457) (243) (310) Dividends paid to stockholders (136) (127) (128) Free Cash Flow $ 142 $ 405 $ 320 (1) Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 reflected the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which resulted in $200 million of receivables, which were previously accounted for as sold and removed from the balance sheet when transferred under the accounts receivable securitization program, being included on the 2010 balance sheet as trade receivables, net. This increase in receivables reduced cash from operations by $200 million in first quarter 2010. (2) Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 included the use of $110 million for the tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of the tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011 and the impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in 2010, cash provided by operating activities decreased $40 million in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital and higher cash payments for employee pension and incentive pay plans during the year, which were partially offset by higher net earnings. Working capital increased primarily due to increased inventory primarily as a result of increased raw material costs, increased accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales revenue, and decreased accounts payable primarily due to decreased raw material purchases due to lower sales volume near year end. Excluding the impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Companys accounts receivable securitization program, cash provided by operating activities increased $17 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher net earnings, offset by an increase in working capital and the inclusion in operating cash flow in 2009 of a benefit generated by a change in the tax method for capitalizing assets. Working capital increased due to increased trade receivables primarily attributed to strong sales revenues throughout the year and increased inventories due to higher quantities attributed to improved demand for the Companys products and higher costs. Both the increase in receivables and inventory were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable driven by a higher level of purchasing activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased $300 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily related to the receipt of $615 million from the sale of the PET business offsetting investment of $200 million in short term time deposits having staggered maturities between three and ten months at the investment date and higher capital expenditures, as well as slightly lower payments for acquisitions and investments in joint ventures. Cash used in investing activities increased $73 million in 2010. The increase was primarily related to higher cash outflows for acquisitions and investments in joint ventures, including the acquisition of Genovique and the Korean acetate tow facility, which more than offset lower capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities increased $12 million in 2011. Higher cash outflows for share repurchases and dividends and lower proceeds from borrowings and stock option exercises and other items were mostly offset by significantly lower cash outflows for repayment of borrowings. 54 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The increase in cash used in financing activities of $429 million in 2010 was primarily related to higher cash outflows for repayment of borrowings, including for early repayment of $500 million principal amount of outstanding long term debt, and share repurchases, which more than offset higher cash receipts for proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises and other items. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, in 2012, the Company expects to generate positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends) of between $250 million and $300 million, capital expenditures of between $400 million and $425 million, and U.S. defined benefit pension plan funding of $100 million. Assuming the acquisition of Solutia mid 2012, the priorities for uses of available cash in 2012 are expected to be payment of the quarterly cash dividend, repayment of debt, pension funding, and funding targeted growth initiatives. Liquidity The Company had cash and cash equivalents and short term time deposits as follows: (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 577 $ 516 $ 793 Short term time deposits 200 Total cash and cash equivalents and short term time deposits (1) $ 777 $ 516 $ 793 (1) Cash and cash equivalents and short term time deposits are primarily held in the United States. In addition, at December 31, 2011, the Company had access to the sources of liquidity described below. In December 2011, the Company entered into a $750 million revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") expiring December 2016. The Credit Facility replaces, and has terms substantially similar to, the $700 million revolving credit agreement entered into in April 2006 (the "Prior Credit Facility") which was terminated concurrently with the entry into the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including required maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, and at December 31, 2010, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce capacity for borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Given the expiration date of the Credit Facility, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long term borrowings because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis. Additionally, at December 31, 2011, the Company also had a $200 million line of credit under its annually renewable accounts receivable securitization agreement ("A/R Facility"). The A/R Facility was renewed in July 2011. Borrowings under the A/R Facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lenders borrowing costs, and the Company pays a fee to maintain availability of the A/R Facility. In addition, the A/R Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the A/R Facility. For more information, see Note 10, "Borrowings" and Note 14, "Commitments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new five and ten year debt securities and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long term debt. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. See Note 10, "Borrowings" and Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding debt issuance and extinguishment. For more information regarding interest rates, see Note 10, "Borrowings", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the Company made $102 million, $35 million, and $181 million, respectively, in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short term time deposits, and the other sources of liquidity described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However, the Companys cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastmans products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. On January 26, 2012, in connection with its entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia and in order to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with lenders which contains commitments for a $3.5 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility and sets out the principal terms of a senior unsecured term loan facility for up to $1.25 billion, with any commitments in respect of the term loan facility reducing on a dollar for dollar basis commitments under the bridge term loan facility. Final terms of this financing will be contained in definitive agreements relating to such indebtedness. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $457 million, $243 million, and $310 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Discretionary spending on certain capital projects was deferred in late 2009 in response to the global recession. Capital expenditures remained at a level sufficient for required maintenance and certain strategic growth initiatives through first nine months 2010. In fourth quarter 2010, the Company increased spending on discretionary infrastructure projects and certain strategic growth initiatives to $110 million which carried into 2011. Capital expenditures in 2011 primarily increased due to organic growth initiatives, particularly in the Specialty Plastics, CASPI, and PCI segments. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects that 2012 capital spending will be between $400 million and $425 million. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects 2012 depreciation and amortization to be slightly higher than 2011 expenses of $273 million, primarily due to the completion of capacity expansions and a full year of depreciation on assets from 2011 acquisitions completed in 2011, including Sterling. Other Commitments At December 31, 2011, the Companys obligations related to outstanding indebtedness in the form of notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.6 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 15 years. 56 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $1.4 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month to month operating leases totaling $105 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 10 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 60 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; and approximately 30 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $1.6 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other post employment obligations, and environmental reserves. The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Payments Due for Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities (a) Total (b) 2012 $ 147 $ 6 $ 87 $ 276 $ 27 $ 270 $ 813 2013 81 264 20 51 416 2014 81 143 11 52 287 2015 250 82 137 8 56 533 2016 74 137 7 67 285 2017 and beyond 1,195 454 461 32 1,100 3,242 Total $ 1,592 $ 6 $ 859 $ 1,418 $ 105 $ 1,596 $ 5,576 (a) Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post employment benefits and taxes payable in the periods indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. (b) Not included in the above table is the expected payment of approximately $2.7 billion in cash in order to complete the Solutia acquisition or any obligations to be assumed upon completion of the acquisition of Solutia. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it has guaranteed a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2011 totaled $184 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars and company aircraft. Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $139 million and $45 million will expire in 2012 and 2016 and beyond, respectively. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. As described in Note 7, "Equity Investments", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastmans Kingsport, Tennessee plant. This investment is accounted for under the equity method. Eastmans net investment in the joint venture at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $28 million and $32 million, respectively, which was comprised of the recognized portion of the ventures accumulated deficits, long term amounts owed to Primester, and a line of credit from Eastman to Primester. 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. The accounting guidance on consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") is effective for all VIEs or potential VIEs the Company is involved with on or after January 1, 2010. This guidance amended the evaluation criteria to identify which entity has a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments. The Company has evaluated its material contractual relationships under this guidance and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not VIEs or, in the case of Primester, a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the Companys Kingsport, Tennessee plant, the Company has shared control of the VIE. As such, the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. Non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or liquidity. Treasury Stock On October 3, 2011, the Company distributed a two for one split of the Companys common stock in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. For additional information, see Note 17, "Stockholders Equity " to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In October 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized $700 million for repurchase of the Companys outstanding common stock. The Company completed the $700 million repurchase authorization in November 2010, acquiring a total of 22.4 million shares. In August 2010, the Companys Board of Directors authorized $300 million for the repurchase of the Companys outstanding common. The Company completed the $300 million repurchase authorization in June 2011, acquiring a total of 7.1 million shares. In February 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. As of December 31, 2011, a total of 4,757,639 shares of common stock have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of approximately $202 million. During 2011, the Company repurchased 7,258,031 shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $316 million. Dividends The Companys Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.235 per share in first and second quarters and $0.260 per share in third and fourth quarters 2011 for a total of $0.990 per share in 2011. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.220 per share in first, second, and third quarters and $0.235 per share in fourth quarter 2010 for a total of $0.895 per share in 2010, and $0.220 per share for all quarters, for a total of $0.880 per share in 2009. The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.260 per share during the first quarter of 2012, payable on April 2, 2012 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2012. 58 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastmans policies as described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Companys preliminary assessment of actions that may be required management does not believe that the Companys liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $29 million at December 31, 2011. In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure and postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. The best estimate accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs is $28 million at December 31, 2011. GAAP requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation ("CARO") when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company has performed an examination of various asset categories as of December 31, 2011. Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Reserves related to environmental asset retirement obligations accounted for approximately 75 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2011. Currently, the Companys environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next 50 years. If the Company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. The Companys cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $219 million, $200 million, and $173 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included $35 million in expenditures for engineering and construction in 2011. Cash expenditures in 2012 are expected to increase primarily as a result of full year integration of 2011 acquisitions and of the expected mid 2012 acquisition of Solutia, although no assurances of the timing of completion of this acquisition or the related cash expenditures can be provided. Other than potential capital expenditures at the Companys Kingsport, Tennessee facility related to regulations associated with controlling air emissions from boilers, the Company does not currently expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Companys planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, although no assurances can be provided as to the timing or amount of any capital expenditures that may arise as a result of the completion of the expected acquisition of Solutia. Potential capital expenditures associated with boiler air emissions remain uncertain pending adoption of final regulations, but could increase average annual capital expenditures significantly over the next five years compared to recent historical levels depending on final regulation requirements and the Companys method of addressing those requirements. INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastmans costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market price fluctuations. The volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit. For additional information see Note 12, "Derivatives", to the Companys consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures with the purpose of converging the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance issued by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The guidance includes amendments that clarify the intent of the application of existing fair value measurement requirements along with amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for fair value measurements and disclosures. The Company has concluded that the new guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings, Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or related disclosures. 60 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In June 2011, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to presentation of comprehensive income. The standards update is intended to help financial statement users better understand the causes of an entitys change in financial position and results of operation. It is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. The amendments require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB amended this guidance in December 2011 to postpone a requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement where the components of net income and other comprehensive income are presented and reinstate previous guidance related to such reclassifications. Upon adoption, the Company will continue to present components of comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only, the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued amended accounting guidance to enhance disclosure requirements for instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its disclosures. Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only, the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. OUTLOOK The Company expects to benefit from the strength of its businesses based on modest global economic growth and aided by the full year integration of 2011 acquisitions including Sterling and Scandiflex. The Company expects the volatility of market prices for raw materials and energy to continue and that the Company will continue to use pricing and hedging strategies to offset this volatility. The Company expects to continue with growth initiatives in all segments, as well as to continue to explore and invest in R&D initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally friendly chemistry. The Company expects to complete the acquisition of Solutia mid 2012. This acquisition is subject to approval by Solutias shareholders, receipt of required regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Excluding the impact of the expected acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects: capital spending to be between $400 million and $425 million for organic growth initiatives and maintenance; and between $250 million and $300 million of free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends). Assuming mid 2012 completion of the Solutia acquisition, the Company expects full year diluted earnings per share in 2012 to be approximately $5, excluding acquisition related costs and charges. See "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. 61 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this Annual Report which are not statements of historical fact may be "forward looking statements" as defined in, and subject to the protections of, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These statements, and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; expectations regarding the completion of the acquisition of Solutia including our ability to achieve the expected benefits and synergies from the acquired businesses; pending and future legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans and activities; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated and other future restructuring, acquisition, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; the timing of, and benefits from, the integration of and expected business and financial performance of acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management expectations, plans, and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the underlying assumptions are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of any proposed acquisitions, and the timing or actual achievement of expected benefits from, integration plans relating to, and expected synergies from, acquired businesses. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the most significant known factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statement. Additional factors not presently known to the Company, or that the Company does not currently believe to be material, may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Adverse and uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company. While economic and financial market conditions have improved from those in 2008 and 2009, continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, particularly in Europe, may adversely affect the Companys results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Companys business and operating results were affected by the impact of the recent global recession, including the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that affected the global economy. If the global economy or financial markets again deteriorate or experience significant new disruptions, the Companys results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected; in addition the Companys ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained, which may negatively impact the Companys liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives. 62 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results. The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. These risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations. In addition, natural disasters, plant interruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities. The Company could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to manufacturing operations or related infrastructure. Significant limitation of the Companys ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Companys sales revenue, costs, results of operations, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as natural disasters, pandemic illness, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. Loss or financial weakness of any of the Companys largest customers could adversely affect our financial results. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of our largest customers could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives. The Company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both internal (or "organic") development and acquisitions and joint ventures to diversify and extend the portfolio of our businesses. These growth opportunities include development and commercialization of new products and technologies, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, and alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Companys portfolio of businesses and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses) will result in financially successful commercialization of products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Companys results of operations. There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of proposed acquisitions, expected benefits of proposed acquisitions, integration plans, and expected synergies therefrom. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed investments and projects. 63 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The pending acquisition of Solutia exposes the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, both before and after its completion, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations. In connection with Eastmans agreement to complete the acquisition of Solutia, and during its pendency, the Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These risks include, but are not limited to: that the Company may not complete the acquisition of Solutia on terms contained in the merger agreement, which could impact the purchase price to be paid, assets to be acquired, covenants relating to Eastmans or Solutias operations, or timing thereof; that the Company may continue to incur significant additional costs and expend significant additional time and effort prior to the closing and if the transaction is delayed or not consummated, the Company may not be able to realize any benefit therefrom; that the Company may not be able to obtain the financing it intends to obtain in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia; and that Solutia can require Eastman to complete the acquisition in certain situations that could result in the Company incurring significant additional costs. In the event the Company does complete the acquisition of Solutia, it may become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These risks and uncertainties include that the Company: will be required to incur substantial additional indebtedness in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia; may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, or tax synergies expected from the acquisition of Solutia, or there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; and may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate Solutias businesses into Eastmans. Legislative or regulatory actions could increase the Companys future compliance costs. The Companys facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. The Companys accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the Companys assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Pending and proposed U.S. Federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the Companys manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs. In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and "Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents managements best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects. 64 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company") has exposure to market risks from changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations. To mitigate the Companys exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. From time to time, to manage the Companys mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, the Company enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, these borrowings, investments, and swaps were predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately $145 million and $123 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates. The Companys operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company from time to time enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2011, the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $53 million, with an additional $5 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. At December 31, 2010, the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $60 million, with an additional $6 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. Since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy. To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, natural gas, and ethane, the Company enters into option and forward contracts. At December 31, 2011, the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $10 million with less than an additional $1 million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. At December 31, 2010, the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $6 million, with less than an additional $1 million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. 65
