ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) is one of the largest independent (non integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with substantial proved reserves in the United States, Canada, offshore Trinidad and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom North Sea. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy which focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet, with a below average debt to total capitalization ratio. EOG had another year of record operating earnings in 2004. Net income available to common for 2004 of $614 million was up 47% over 2003 earnings of $419 million, attributable primarily to higher commodity prices and increased production. At December 31, 2004, EOGs total reserves were 5.6 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 430 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), or 8% higher than 2003. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2004. United States and Canada. During 2004, EOG opened a new office in Fort Worth, Texas to expand its drilling success in the Barnett Shale play of the Fort Worth Basin. EOG made significant gas discoveries in the non core portion of the trend located south and west of the city of Fort Worth. EOG plans to focus on increasing production and further defining the plays ultimate size during 2005. EOGs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG plans to continue to drill smaller wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate will contribute substantially to EOGs crude oil and natural gas production. EOG has several larger potential plays under way in Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Oklahoma and western Canada. International. In mid 2004, EOG began natural gas sales to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) under a fifteen year take or pay contract. This gas is being resold by NGC to an anhydrous ammonia plant located in Point Lisas, Trinidad. The plant is owned by Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited (N2000). At December 31, 2004, EOGs subsidiary, EOG Resources NITRO2000 Ltd., owned an approximate 23% equity interest in N2000. Under the contract, EOG supplies approximately 60 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) gross of natural gas to NGC. Although EOG continues to focus on United States and Canada natural gas, EOG sees an increasing linkage between United States and Canada natural gas demand and Trinidadian natural gas supply. For example, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from existing and planned facilities in Trinidad are serious contenders to meet increasing United States demand. In addition, ammonia, methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the United States and Canada to Trinidad, driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation. EOG anticipates that its existing position with the supply contracts to the two ammonia plants and the new methanol plant, will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to United States and Canada natural gas fundamentals. In 2004, EOG continued its progress in the Southern Gas Basin of the United Kingdom North Sea. A development well was drilled in the Valkyrie field and commenced production in August 2004. In addition, the production facilities were installed in the Arthur field, which was discovered in 2003, and production commenced in January 2005. EOG continues to review additional opportunities in this area and expects to participate in several exploration wells in 2005. 19 Capital Structure As noted, one of managements key strategies is to keep a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2004, EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 27%, down from 33% at year end 2003. By primarily utilizing cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from stock options exercised in 2004, EOG funded its $1.5 billion exploration and development expenditures, paid down $31 million of debt, redeemed all 500 outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock for $50 million and increased the dividend paid to common shareholders by 20%. In addition, in 2005, EOGs Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common stock by 33%. As management currently assesses price forecast and demand trends for 2005, EOG believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can essentially be funded by cash from operations. For 2005, EOGs estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately $1.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada natural gas continues to be a key component of this effort. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. 20 Results of Operations Net Operating Revenues During 2004, net operating revenues increased $527 million to $2,271 million. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids from producing wells, increased 27% to $2,301 million as compared to $1,818 million in 2003. Natural Gas Revenues consists of natural gas wellhead revenues and revenues from marketing activities associated with the sales and purchases of natural gas. Revenues from natural gas marketing activities were $2 million for each of 2004 and 2003. Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids revenues represent solely wellhead revenues for these products. Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcf per day) (1) United States 631 638 635 Canada 212 165 154 Trinidad 186 152 135 United Kingdom 7 Total 1,036 955 924 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (2) United States $ 5.72 $ 5.06 $ 2.89 Canada 5.22 4.66 2.67 Trinidad 1.51 1.35 1.20 United Kingdom 5.14 Composite 4.86 4.40 2.60 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbl per day) (1) United States 21.1 18.5 18.8 Canada 2.7 2.3 2.1 Trinidad 3.6 2.4 2.4 Total 27.4 23.2 23.3 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $40.73 $30.24 $24.79 Canada 37.68 28.54 23.62 Trinidad 39.12 28.88 23.58 Composite 40.22 29.92 24.56 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbl per day) (1) United States 4.8 3.2 2.9 Canada 0.8 0.6 0.8 Total 5.6 3.8 3.7 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $27.79 $21.53 $14.76 Canada 23.23 19.13 11.17 Composite 27.13 21.13 14.05 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfe per day) (3) United States 786 768 765 Canada 233 183 171 Trinidad 207 166 150 United Kingdom 7 Total 1,233 1,117 1,086 Total Bcfe (3) Deliveries 451.5 407.8 396.3 (1) Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable. (2) Dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel, as applicable. (3) Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. 21 2004 compared to 2003. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2004 increased $307 million, or 20%, to $1,842 million from $1,535 million for 2003 due to increases in natural gas deliveries ($134 million) and the composite average wellhead natural gas price ($173 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 10% to $4.86 per Mcf for 2004 from $4.40 per Mcf in 2003. Natural gas deliveries increased 81 MMcf per day, or 8%, to 1,036 MMcf per day for 2004 from 955 MMcf per day in 2003, due to a 47 MMcf per day, or 28%, increase in Canada; a 34 MMcf per day, or 22%, increase in Trinidad; and a 7 MMcf per day increase in the United Kingdom due to commencement of production in August 2004, partially offset by a 7 MMcf per day, or 1% decline in the United States. The increased deliveries in Canada (47 MMcf per day) were attributable to property acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and additional production related to post acquisition drilling. The increase in Trinidad was attributable to the increased production from the U(a) block (22 MMcf per day) which began supplying natural gas in mid 2004 to the N2000 ammonia plant and commencement of production from the Parula wells on the SECC block in February 2004 (12 MMcf per day). Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $149 million, or 59%, to $403 million from $254 million as compared to 2003, due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($103 million) and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($46 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2004 was $40.22 per barrel compared to $29.92 per barrel for 2003. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries increased 4.2 MBbl per day, or 18%, to 27.4 MBbl per day from 23.2 MBbl per day for 2003. The increase was mainly due to production from new wells in the United States (2.6 MBbl per day) and higher production in Trinidad from the Parula wells (0.8 MBbl per day) and from the U(a) block as a result of new production (0.4 MBbl per day). Natural gas liquids revenues were $26 million higher than a year ago primarily due to increases in deliveries ($14 million) and the composite average price ($12 million). During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. During 2003, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $80 million, which included realized losses of $45 million and collar premium payments of $3 million. 2003 compared to 2002. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2003 increased $657 million, or 75%, due to increases in the composite average wellhead natural gas price and natural gas deliveries. The composite average wellhead price for natural gas increased 69% to $4.40 per Mcf for 2003 from $2.60 per Mcf in 2002. Natural gas deliveries increased to 955 MMcf per day for 2003 from 924 MMcf per day for the comparable period in 2002. The overall increase in natural gas deliveries was primarily due to an increase in Canada of 7% to 165 MMcf per day and an increase in Trinidad of 13% to 152 MMcf per day in 2003. The 7%, or 11 MMcf per day, increase in Canada was primarily attributable to a major property acquisition in the fourth quarter. The 13%, or 17 MMcf per day, increase in Trinidad was attributable to a full year of sales to the CNCL ammonia plant versus only six months of sales in 2002. Natural gas marketing activities increased natural gas revenues by $2 million and $37 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $45 million, or 22%, due to increases in the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price. The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2003 was $29.92 per barrel compared to $24.56 per barrel for 2002. Natural gas liquids revenues were $11 million higher than a year ago primarily due to a 50% increase in the composite average price and a 3% increase in deliveries. During 2003, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $80 million, which included realized losses of $45 million and collar premium payments of $3 million. During 2002, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $49 million, which included realized losses of $21 million and a $2 million collar premium payment. 22 Operating and Other Expenses 2004 compared to 2003. During 2004, operating expenses of $1,292 million were $245 million higher than the $1,047 million incurred in 2003. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.60 $0.52 DD&A 1.12 1.08 G&A 0.25 0.25 Taxes Other than Income 0.30 0.21 Interest Expense, Net 0.14 0.14 Total Per Unit Costs $2.41 $2.20 The higher per unit rates of lease and well, DD&A and taxes other than income for 2004 compared to 2003 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $271 million were $58 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a general increase in service costs related to increased operating activities, including an increase in the number of wells, in the United States ($18 million), Canada ($16 million), and Trinidad ($1 million); increased transportation related costs in the United States ($14 million), Canada ($2 million) and the United Kingdom ($2 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($5 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses of $504 million increased $63 million from 2003 due primarily to increased production in Canada ($18 million), the United States ($10 million), and Trinidad ($4 million); the commencement of production in the United Kingdom ($2 million); increased DD&A rates in the United States due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties ($13 million); increased DD&A rates in Canada mainly from developing acquired proved reserves ($8 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($7 million). General and administrative (G&A) expenses of $115 million were $15 million higher than 2003 due primarily to expanded operations. Taxes other than income of $134 million were $48 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a decrease in credits taken against severance taxes resulting from the qualification of additional wells for a Texas high cost gas severance tax exemption ($19 million); an increase as a result of higher wellhead revenues in the United States ($13 million), Trinidad ($2 million) and Canada ($1 million); higher property taxes as a result of higher property valuation in the United States ($6 million); the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($5 million); and an increase in the number of wells and facilities in Canada ($2 million). Exploration costs of $94 million were $18 million higher than 2003 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($6 million), Canada ($3 million), the United Kingdom ($3 million) and Trinidad ($1 million); and increased exploration administrative expenses across EOG ($4 million). Impairments of $82 million were $8 million lower than 2003 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($10 million), partially offset by higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($2 million). Total impairments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" were $25 million in each of 2004 and 2003. Net interest expense of $63 million was $4 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a slightly higher average debt balance. Other Income (Expense), Net for 2004 included income from equity investments of $11 million, gains on sales of reserves and related assets of $6 million and foreign currency transaction losses of $7 million as a result of applying the changes in the Canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany short term loans that eliminate in consolidation. 23 Income tax provision increased $85 million to $301 million compared to 2003, primarily resulting from higher income before income taxes ($95 million) and an increase in state income taxes ($2 million), offset by lower deferred income taxes associated with the Alberta, Canada corporate tax rate ($5 million) and lower effective foreign income tax rates ($2 million). As a result of these changes, the net effective tax rate for 2004 remained unchanged from the 2003 rate of 33%. In November 2003, Canada enacted legislation reducing the Canadian federal income tax rate for companies in the resource sector from 28% to 27% for 2003, with further reductions to 21% phased in over the next four years. This legislation also made changes to the tax treatment of crown royalties and the resource allowance. Beginning in 2003, Canadian taxpayers are allowed to deduct 10% of actual provincial and other crown royalties. This percentage increases each year through 2007, at which time 100% of crown royalties will be deductible. The resource allowance, a statutory deduction calculated as 25% of adjusted resource profits, will be phased out through 2007, when the deduction will be completely eliminated. 2003 compared to 2002. During 2003, operating expenses of $1,047 million were $133 million higher than the $914 million incurred in 2002. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2003 2002 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.52 $0.45 DD&A 1.08 1.00 G&A 0.25 0.22 Taxes Other than Income 0.21 0.18 Interest Expense, Net 0.14 0.15 Total Per Unit Costs $2.20 $2.00 The higher per unit rates of lease and well, DD&A, G&A and taxes other than income for 2003 compared to 2002 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $213 million were $33 million higher than 2002 due primarily to a general increase in service costs related to increased operating activities, including an increase in the number of wells, in the United States ($15 million) and Canada ($4 million); increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($7 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million). DD&A expenses of $442 million increased $44 million from the prior year due primarily to more relative production from higher cost properties in the United States ($20 million) and Canada ($5 million); increased production in Canada ($3 million) and Trinidad ($2 million) and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($8 million). Also, included in DD&A expenses for 2003 was $5 million of accretion expense related to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." G&A expenses of $100 million were $11 million higher than the period a year ago due primarily to expanded operations ($9 million) and increased insurance expense ($5 million), partially offset by decreased legal costs ($3 million). Taxes other than income of $86 million were $14 million higher than the prior year period primarily due to an increase of approximately $35 million as a result of increased wellhead revenues as previously discussed, partially offset by $24 million of severance tax credits from the qualification of wells for a Texas high cost gas severance tax exemption. Exploration costs of $76 million were $16 million higher than a year ago due primarily to an increase in technical staff costs across EOG ($7 million) and increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($5 million) and Trinidad ($3 million). Impairments increased $21 million to $89 million compared to a year ago due to higher amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($25 million). Total impairments under SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" for 2003 and 2002 were $25 million and $30 million, respectively. 24 Other Income (Expense), Net for 2003 included foreign currency transaction gains of $9 million as a result of applying the changes in the Canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany short term loans that eliminate in consolidation and income from equity investments of $4 million. Income tax provision increased $184 million to $217 million for 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily resulting from higher income before income taxes for federal ($187 million) and state ($4 million), expiration of the tight gas sands federal income tax credit as of December 31, 2002 ($4 million), and higher effective foreign income tax rates ($4 million), primarily offset by net tax benefit associated with the Canadian tax law change ($14 million). Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2004 included funds generated from operations, funds from new borrowings and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan. Primary cash outflows included funds used in operations, exploration and development expenditures, oil and gas property acquisitions, repayment of debt, redemption of preferred stock, common stock repurchases and dividends. 2004 compared to 2003. Net operating cash inflows of $1,444 million in 2004 increased $195 million as compared to 2003 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues of $482 million, partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses of $139 million, an increase in current tax expense of $72 million, unfavorable changes in working capital and other liabilities of $48 million and an increase in realized losses from mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $38 million. Net investing cash outflows of $1,397 million in 2004 increased by $189 million as compared to 2003 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties of $171 million and unfavorable changes in working capital related to investing activities of $12 million. Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used by financing activities was $43 million in 2004 versus $57 million in 2003. Cash provided by financing activities for 2004 included long term debt borrowing of $150 million and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $76 million. Cash used by financing activities for 2004 included repayments of long term debt borrowings of $175 million, redemption of all 500 outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock of $50 million and cash dividend payments of $38 million. 2003 compared to 2002. Net operating cash inflows of $1,249 million in 2003 increased $638 million as compared to 2002 primarily reflecting an increase wellhead commodity revenues of $713 million and favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities of $117 million, partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses of $75 million, an increase in current tax expense of $75 million and an increase in realized losses from mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $24 million. Net investing cash outflows of $1,207 million in 2003 increased by $391 million as compared to 2002 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties of $485 million, which includes $366 million related to two Canadian asset purchases, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital related to investing activities of $82 million. Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. 25 Cash used by financing activities was $57 million in 2003 versus cash provided of $211 million in 2002. Financing activities for 2003 included repayment of the outstanding balances of commercial paper borrowings and the uncommitted line of credit of $22 million and $14 million, respectively, repurchases of EOGs common stock of $21 million, cash dividend payments of $31 million and proceeds of $35 million from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan. Exploration and Development Expenditures The table below sets out components of exploration and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, along with the total budgeted for 2005, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2005 2004 2003 2002 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $1,120 $ 731 $ 595 Leasehold Acquisitions 143 59 39 Producing Property Acquisitions 52 405 71 Capitalized Interest 10 9 9 Subtotal 1,325 1,204 714 Exploration Costs 94 76 60 Dry Hole Costs 92 41 47 Exploration and Development Expenditures 1,511 1,321 821 Approximately $1,600 Asset Retirement Costs (1) 16 12 Deferred Income Tax on Acquired Properties (17) 15 Total (2) $1,510 $1,333 $ 836 (1) The Asset Retirement Costs are netted with $1 million net gains recognized upon settlement of asset retirement obligations for each of 2004 and 2003. Asset Retirement Costs for 2003 does not include the cumulative effect of adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003. (2) Pro forma total expenditures for 2002 are not presented since the pro forma application of SFAS No. 143 to the prior periods would not result in pro forma total expenditures materially different from the actual amounts reported. Exploration and development expenditures of $1.5 billion for 2004 were $190 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling expenditures ($439 million) resulting from higher exploration and development activities in Canada and Trinidad and higher cost structures in the United States and Canada; increased lease acquisitions in the United States ($84 million), primarily in the non core Barnett Shale area and, to a lesser extent, in South Texas; and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($20 million); partially offset by decreased property acquisitions ($353 million). The higher cost structure was primarily due to increases in materials and services across the industry. The 2004 exploration and development expenditures of $1.5 billion includes $1,009 million in development, $440 million in exploration, $52 million in property acquisitions and $10 million in capitalized interest. The 2003 exploration and development expenditures of $1,321 million included $651 million in development, $256 million in exploration, $405 million in property acquisitions and $9 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. There are no material continuing commitments associated with current expenditure plans. Derivative Transactions During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. During 2003, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $80 million, which included realized losses of $45 million and collar premium payments of $3 million. (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 26 Presented below is a summary of EOGs 2005 natural gas financial collar contracts at February 25, 2005, with prices expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and notional volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud). As indicated, EOG does not have any financial collar or swap contracts that cover periods beyond March 2005. Moreover, EOG has not entered into any additional natural gas financial collar contracts or natural gas or crude oil financial price swap contracts since December 31, 2004. EOG accounts for these collar and swap contracts using mark to market accounting. Natural Gas Financial Collar Contracts Floor Price Ceiling Price Weighted Weighted Settlement Volume Floor Range Average Ceiling Range Average Price 2005 (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) Jan(1) 75,000 $7.65 8.00 $7.77 $8.90 9.50 $9.10 $6.35 Feb(2) 75,000 7.65 8.00 7.77 9.19 9.50 9.32 6.36 Mar(2) 75,000 7.65 8.00 7.77 9.19 9.50 9.32 6.24 (1) Notional volumes of 25,000 MMBtud of the January 2005 collar contracts were purchased at a premium of $0.10 per MMBtu. (2) The collar contracts for February 2005 and March 2005 were purchased at a premium of $0.10 per MMBtu. Financing EOGs long term debt to total capitalization ratio was 27% as of December 31, 2004 compared to 33% as of December 31, 2003. During 2004, total long term debt decreased $31 million to $1,078 million (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of EOGs long term debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $1,146 million and $1,175 million, respectively, based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates currently available to EOG at yearend. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2004, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $59 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2004, EOG utilized commercial paper, and during 2003, EOG utilized commercial paper and committed bank loans, in addition to operating cash flows, to fund its operations. These loans are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While EOG maintains a $600 million commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2004 was $321 million, and the amount outstanding at yearend was $92 million. EOG considers this excess availability, which is contractually backed by the $600 million Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2, combined with the $688 million of availability under its shelf registration described below, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. Based on resources available at December 31, 2004, during 2005, EOG plans to replace the Senior Unsecured Term Loan Facility due 2005 with long term debt. In 2004, the short term commercial paper loan balance was reduced ($6 million) and the $100 million, 6.50% Notes were paid off by long term debt refinancing. 27 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 (in thousands): 2011 & Contractual Obligations(1) Total 2005 2006 2008 2009 2010 beyond Long Term Debt (2) $1,077,622 $ 166,800 $ 400,822 $ $ 510,000 Non cancelable Operating Leases 45,784 13,497 20,934 5,594 5,759 Drilling Rig Commitments 2,214 1,142 1,072 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (3) 128,983 21,697 49,518 19,139 38,629 Seismic Purchase Obligations 7,904 7,904 Other Purchase Obligations 2,918 1,628 1,290 Total Contractual Obligations $1,265,425 $ 212,668 $ 473,636 $ 24,733 $ 554,388 (1) This table does not include the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties. Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, EOG recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, this table does not include EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Commercial paper and the Senior Unsecured Term Loan Facility due 2005 are classified as long term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on EOGs intent and ability to ultimately replace such amounts with other long term debt. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the Canadian foreign currency exchange rate at December 31, 2004. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. Shelf Registration As of February 25, 2005, the amount available under various filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the offer and sale from time to time of EOG debt securities, preferred stock and or common stock totaled $688 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2004, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2004 was the Canadian Dollar. While the continued strengthening of the Canadian Dollar in 2004 impacted both the revenues and expenses recorded on the income statements of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries, its impacts on the items were not to the same extent. Since the Canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. 28 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2004, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $23.1 million in Other Liabilities in the Liabilities section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This amount is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Shareholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. In EOGs opinion, overall natural gas production in the United States is declining. In addition, the increasing recognition of natural gas as a more environmentally friendly source of energy is likely to result in increases in demand. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. Assuming a totally unhedged position for 2005, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2005 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price is approximately $21 million for net income and operating cash flow. EOG is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil price. EOGs price sensitivity for each $1.00 per barrel change in average wellhead crude oil prices is approximately $6.5 million for net income and operating cash flow. For information regarding EOGs natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2004, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Marketing companies have played an important role in the United States and Canada natural gas market. These companies aggregate natural gas supplies through purchases from producers like EOG and then resell the gas to end users, local distribution companies or other buyers. In recent years, several of the largest natural gas marketing companies have filed for bankruptcy or are having financial difficulty, and others are exiting this business. EOG does not believe that this will have a material effect on its ability to market its natural gas production. EOG continues to assess and monitor the credit worthiness of partners to whom it sells its production and where appropriate, to seek new markets. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. However, in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, EOG anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the United States and Canada. In addition, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in other exploitation type opportunities. Budgeted 2005 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $1.6 billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOGs strategy of funding the United States and Canada exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in 2005 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, EOG believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2005 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 29 Environmental Regulations Various federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, affect EOGs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOGs control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOGs overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOGs operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. 30 Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found due to the requirement of a significant capital investment. Such exploratory drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify development when the investment is made and additional exploratory wells are either in progress or firmly planned. All other exploratory wells that do not meet these criteria are expensed after one year. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003 EOG had exploratory drilling costs of $4.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively, related to an outside operated, deepwater offshore Gulf of Mexico discovery that has been deferred for more than one year and will require significant future capital expenditures before production can commence. These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no material exploratory drilling costs capitalized for more than one year for projects that did not require a major capital investment. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. When circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depletion, depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. The reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and or property dispositions, and 4) impairments. Stock Options EOG accounts for stock options under the provisions and related interpretations of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." No compensation expense is recognized for such options. As allowed by SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" issued in 1995, EOG has continued to apply APB Opinion No. 25 for purposes of determining net income and to present the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. 31 In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment," which supersedes SFAS No. 148. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. This eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. EOG currently expects to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) effective July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. EOG expects that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) would reduce second half 2005 net earnings by a pre tax amount of approximately $10 million which includes approximately $0.5 million for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires a public entity to present its cash flows provided by tax benefits from stock options exercised in the Financing Cash Flows section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Had SFAS No. 123(R) been in effect, EOGs Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities would have been reduced and its Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities would have been increased on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows by $29 million, $12 million and $5 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding EOGs future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or by comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports and changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOGs success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the availability and cost of drilling rigs, experienced drilling crews and tubular steel; the availability of pipeline transportation capacity; the extent to which EOG can replicate on its other Barnett Shale acreage the results of its most recent Barnett Shale wells; the results of wells yet to be drilled that are necessary to test whether substantial Barnett Shale acreage positions outside of Johnson and Parker Counties, Texas, contain suitable drilling prospects; whether EOG is successful in its efforts to more densely develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale and other production areas; political developments around the world; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and financial market conditions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements might not occur. EOG undertakes no obligations to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 32 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk EOGs exposure to interest rate risk and commodity price risk is discussed respectively in the Financing and Outlook sections of the "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity."
