ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) is one of the largest independent (non integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, offshore Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. EOG operates under a consistent strategy which focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common for 2005 of $1,252 million was up 104% compared to 2004 net income available to common of $614 million, attributable primarily to higher commodity prices and increased production. At December 31, 2005, EOGs total reserves were 6.2 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 548 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2004. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2005. United States and Canada. The Fort Worth, Texas office was opened in 2004 to expand on EOGs drilling success in the Barnett Shale play of the Fort Worth Basin. EOG has successfully expanded the play beyond its conventional limits by using horizontal drilling and enhanced completion technology. By year end 2005, EOG had over 500,000 acres under lease in several counties. EOG plans on substantially increasing its drilling program in 2006. EOGs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOGs crude oil and natural gas production. EOG has several larger potential plays under way in Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Oklahoma and western Canada. International. During 2005, EOG commenced natural gas production in Trinidad to supply two new long term contracts. First, EOG is supplying natural gas that is being used as feedstock for the M5000 methanol plant which commenced operations in September 2005. Second, the Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) began taking gas in December 2005, prior to commercial operations, and volumes supplied by EOG during this pre start up period have been higher than EOGs contractual rate. Although EOG continues to focus on United States and Canada natural gas, EOG sees an increasing linkage between United States and Canada natural gas demand and Trinidad natural gas supply. For example, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from existing and planned facilities in Trinidad are serious contenders to meet increasing United States demand. In addition, ammonia, methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the United States and Canada to Trinidad, driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation. EOG believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to the two ammonia plants, the new methanol plant and the ALNG, will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to United States and Canada natural gas fundamentals. In 2005, EOG continued its progress in the Southern Gas Basin of the United Kingdom North Sea. Production commenced in January 2005 from the Arthur 1 well and in July 2005 from the Arthur 2 well. The Arthur 3 well is expected to spud in the first half of 2006. EOG expects only modest activity in 2006 due to the difficulty in obtaining rigs in the North Sea. 22 Capital Structure As noted, one of managements key strategies is to keep a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2005, EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 19%, down from 27% at year end 2004. By primarily utilizing cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from stock options exercised in 2005, EOG funded its $1,858 million exploration and development expenditures, paid down $93 million of debt and paid dividends to common shareholders of $36 million. In addition, in 2006, EOGs Board of Directors increased the cash dividend on common stock to an annual rate of $0.24 per share, which represents a 50% increase in the annual cash dividend. As management currently assesses price forecast and demand trends for 2006, EOG believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can essentially be funded by cash from operations. For 2006, EOGs estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately $2.5 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada natural gas continues to be a key component of this effort. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management believes that EOG continues to maintain one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. 23 Results of Operations Net Operating Revenues During 2005, net operating revenues increased $1,349 million to $3,620 million from $2,271 million in 2004. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, increased $1,306 million, or 57%, to $3,607 million as compared to $2,301 million in 2004. Natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids revenues solely represent wellhead revenues for these products. Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 718 631 638 Canada 228 212 165 Trinidad 231 186 152 United Kingdom 39 7 Total 1,216 1,036 955 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (2) United States $ 7.86 $ 5.72 $ 5.06 Canada 7.14 5.22 4.66 Trinidad 2.20 (3) 1.51 1.35 United Kingdom 6.99 5.14 Composite 6.62 4.86 4.40 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 21.5 21.1 18.5 Canada 2.4 2.7 2.3 Trinidad 4.5 3.6 2.4 United Kingdom 0.2 Total 28.6 27.4 23.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 54.57 $ 40.73 $ 30.24 Canada 50.49 37.68 28.54 Trinidad 57.36 39.12 28.88 United Kingdom 49.62 Composite 54.63 40.22 29.92 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 6.6 4.8 3.2 Canada 0.9 0.8 0.6 Total 7.5 5.6 3.8 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 35.59 $ 27.79 $ 21.53 Canada 35.59 23.23 19.13 Composite 35.59 27.13 21.13 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (4) United States 886 786 768 Canada 248 233 183 Trinidad 259 207 166 United Kingdom 40 7 Total 1,433 1,233 1,117 Total Bcfe (4) Deliveries 523.0 451.5 407.8 (1)Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable.

(4)Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. 24 2005 compared to 2004. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2005 increased $1,097 million, or 60%, to $2,939 million from $1,842 million for 2004 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($763 million), increased natural gas deliveries ($315 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take or pay contract ($19 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 36% to $6.62 per Mcf for 2005 from $4.86 per Mcf in 2004. Excluding the aforementioned adjustment, the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 35% to $6.58 per Mcf for 2005. This adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 180 MMcfd, or 17%, to 1,216 MMcfd for 2005 from 1,036 MMcfd in 2004. The increase was due to higher production of 87 MMcfd in the United States, 45 MMcfd in Trinidad, 32 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 16 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (63 MMcfd) and Louisiana (20 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was due to the increased contractual requirements and demand related to the ammonia and methanol plants. The increase in the United Kingdom was due to the commencement of production from the Arthur field in January 2005 (24 MMcfd) and the full year production from the Valkyrie field, which commenced production in August 2004 (8 MMcfd). The increase in Canada was attributable to the drilling program, primarily in the Wapiti, Drumheller and Connorsville areas. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $168 million, or 42%, to $571 million from $403 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($151 million) and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($17 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2005 was $54.63 per barrel compared to $40.22 per barrel for 2004. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $42 million, or 76%, to $97 million from $55 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in the composite average price ($23 million) and deliveries ($19 million). During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. 2004 compared to 2003. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2004 increased $307 million, or 20%, to $1,842 million from $1,535 million for 2003 due to increases in natural gas deliveries ($134 million) and the composite average wellhead natural gas price ($173 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 10% to $4.86 per Mcf for 2004 from $4.40 per Mcf in 2003. Natural gas deliveries increased 81 MMcfd, or 8%, to 1,036 MMcfd for 2004 from 955 MMcfd in 2003, due to a 47 MMcfd, or 28%, increase in Canada; a 34 MMcfd, or 22%, increase in Trinidad; and a 7 MMcfd increase in the United Kingdom due to commencement of production in August 2004, partially offset by a 7 MMcfd, or 1% decline in the United States. The increased deliveries in Canada (47 MMcfd) were attributable to property acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and additional production related to post acquisition drilling. The increase in Trinidad was attributable to the increased production from the U(a) Block (22 MMcfd) which began supplying natural gas in mid 2004 to the N2000 ammonia plant and commencement of production from the Parula wells on the SECC Block in February 2004 (12 MMcfd). Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $149 million, or 59%, to $403 million from $254 million as compared to 2003, due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($103 million) and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($46 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2004 was $40.22 per barrel compared to $29.92 per barrel for 2003. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries increased 4.2 MBbld, or 18%, to 27.4 MBbld from 23.2 MBbld for 2003. The increase was mainly due to production from new wells in the United States (2.6 MBbld) and higher production in Trinidad from the Parula wells (0.8 MBbld) and from the U(a) Block as a result of new production (0.4 MBbld). Natural gas liquids revenues were $26 million higher than a year ago primarily due to increases in deliveries ($14 million) and the composite average price ($12 million). 25 During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. During 2003, EOG recognized losses on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $80 million, which included realized losses of $45 million and collar premium payments of $3 million. Operating and Other Expenses 2005 compared to 2004. During 2005, operating expenses of $1,628 million were $336 million higher than the $1,292 million incurred in 2004. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.71 $0.60 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) 1.25 1.12 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.24 0.25 Taxes Other Than Income 0.38 0.30 Interest Expense, Net 0.12 0.14 Total Per Unit Costs (1) $2.70 $2.41 (1)Total per unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs and impairments. The per unit costs of lease and well, including transportation, DD&A, taxes other than income and interest expense, net for 2005 compared to 2004 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expense includes expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expense can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOGs oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, transportation costs associated with selling hydrocarbon products and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other service costs, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep, fuel and power. Workovers are costs to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses, including transportation, of $373 million were $102 million higher than 2004 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($40 million); increased transportation related costs in the United States ($28 million) and the United Kingdom ($7 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($11 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Trinidad ($2 million). DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. EOGs DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact an individual field, such as the field production profile; drilling or acquisition of new wells; disposition of existing wells; reserve revisions (upward or downward), primarily related to well performance; and impairments. Changes to the individual fields, due to any of these factors, may cause EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A expenses of $654 million were $150 million higher than 2004 primarily as a result of increased production in the United States ($46 million), Canada ($6 million) and Trinidad ($5 million) and the commencement of production in the United Kingdom ($14 million). DD&A rates increased in the United States due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties ($59 million) and in Canada predominantly from the development of acquired proved reserves ($9 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($8 million). 26 Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Taxes other than income of $199 million were $65 million higher than 2004. Severance/production taxes increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($41 million), Trinidad ($7 million) and Canada ($3 million), partially offset by the increase in credits taken for a Texas high cost gas severance tax exemption ($10 million) and a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($5 million). Other items contributing to the increase were an additional Trinidadian Supplemental Petroleum Tax expense as a result of 2005 tax legislation that increased the tax expense retroactively to January 2004 ($7 million) and 2004 production tax relief in Trinidad ($6 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($11 million). Net interest expense in 2005 included costs associated with the early retirement of 2008 Notes ($8 million) (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding these early retirement costs, the 2005 net interest expense decreased $8 million compared to 2004 primarily due to higher capitalized interest ($5 million), an interest charge related to the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($2 million) and lower average debt balance in the United States ($1 million). Exploration costs of $133 million were $39 million higher than 2004 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Barnett Shale area. Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $78 million were $4 million lower than 2004 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($12 million) and lower impairments to the carrying value of certain long lived assets in Canada ($8 million), partially offset by higher impairments to the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the United States ($14 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $31 million and $25 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for certain properties in the United States and Canada. Other income, net of $36 million increased $26 million compared to 2004 primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of properties ($7 million), interest income ($6 million) and equity income from investments in the Caribbean Nitrogen Company Limited (CNCL) and Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited (N2000) ammonia plants in 2005 ($5 million); decreased net foreign currency transaction losses ($4 million); and a gain on the sale of part of EOGs interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in the first quarter of 2005 ($2 million). Income tax provision of $706 million increased $404 million as compared to 2004, due primarily to higher pre tax income ($383 million) and income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings ($24 million). The effective tax rate for 2005 increased to 36% from 33% in 2004. 2004 compared to 2003. During 2004, operating expenses of $1,292 million were $245 million higher than the $1,047 million incurred in 2003. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.60 $0.52 DD&A 1.12 1.08 G&A 0.25 0.25 Taxes Other Than Income 0.30 0.21 Interest Expense, Net 0.14 0.14 Total Per Unit Costs $2.41 $2.20 The higher per unit costs of lease and well, including transportation, DD&A and taxes other than income for 2004 compared to 2003 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. 27 Lease and well expenses, including transportation, of $271 million were $58 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a general increase in service costs related to increased operating activities, including an increase in the number of wells, in the United States ($18 million), Canada ($16 million), and Trinidad ($1 million); increased transportation related costs in the United States ($14 million), Canada ($2 million) and the United Kingdom ($2 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($5 million). DD&A expenses of $504 million increased $63 million from 2003 due primarily to increased production in Canada ($18 million), the United States ($10 million), and Trinidad ($4 million); the commencement of production in the United Kingdom ($2 million); increased DD&A rates in the United States due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties ($13 million); increased DD&A rates in Canada mainly from developing acquired proved reserves ($8 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($7 million). G&A expenses of $115 million were $15 million higher than 2003 due primarily to expanded operations. Taxes other than income of $134 million were $48 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a decrease in credits taken against severance taxes resulting from the qualification of additional wells for a Texas high cost gas severance tax exemption ($19 million); an increase as a result of higher wellhead revenues in the United States ($13 million), Trinidad ($2 million) and Canada ($1 million); higher property taxes as a result of higher property valuation in the United States ($6 million); the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($5 million); and an increase in the number of wells and facilities in Canada ($2 million). Exploration costs of $94 million were $18 million higher than 2003 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($6 million), Canada ($3 million), the United Kingdom ($3 million) and Trinidad ($1 million); and increased exploration administrative expenses across EOG ($4 million). Impairments of $82 million were $8 million lower than 2003 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($10 million), partially offset by higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($2 million). Total impairments under SFAS No. 144 were $25 million in each of 2004 and 2003. Net interest expense of $63 million was $4 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a slightly higher average debt balance. Other income (expense), net for 2004 included income from equity investments of $11 million, gains on sales of reserves and related assets of $6 million and foreign currency transaction losses of $7 million as a result of applying the changes in the Canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany short term loans that eliminate in consolidation. Income tax provision increased $85 million to $301 million compared to 2003, primarily resulting from higher income before income taxes ($95 million), offset by lower deferred income taxes associated with the Alberta, Canada corporate tax rate ($5 million) and lower effective foreign income tax rates ($2 million). The net effective tax rate for 2004 remained unchanged from the 2003 rate of 33%. In November 2003, Canada enacted legislation reducing the Canadian federal income tax rate for companies in the resource sector from 28% to 27% for 2003, with further reductions to 21% phased in over the next four years. This legislation also made changes to the tax treatment of crown royalties and the resource allowance. Beginning in 2003, Canadian taxpayers are allowed to deduct 10% of actual provincial and other crown royalties. This percentage increases each year through 2007, at which time 100% of crown royalties will be deductible. The resource allowance, a statutory deduction calculated as 25% of adjusted resource profits, will be phased out through 2007, when the deduction will be completely eliminated. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2005 included funds generated from operations, funds from new borrowings, proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties and proceeds from sales of partial interests in certain equity investments in Trinidad. Primary cash outflows included funds used in operations, exploration and development expenditures, oil and gas property acquisitions, repayment of debt, dividend payments to shareholders, redemption of preferred stock and common stock repurchases. 28 2005 compared to 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,369 million in 2005 increased $925 million as compared to 2004 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,306 million), a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($93 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($35 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($217 million) and an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($279 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,678 million in 2005 increased by $281 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($308 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($28 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in 2005 ($40 million) and the sale of part of EOGs interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in 2005 ($18 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $72 million in 2005 increased $29 million as compared to 2004. Cash provided by financing activities for 2005 included a long term debt borrowing ($250 million) and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($65 million). Cash used by financing activities for 2005 included repayments of long term debt borrowings ($343 million) and cash dividend payments ($43 million). 2004 compared to 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1,444 million in 2004 increased $195 million as compared to 2003 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues of $482 million, partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses of $139 million, an increase in current tax expense of $72 million, unfavorable changes in working capital and other liabilities of $48 million and an increase in realized losses from mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $38 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $1,397 million in 2004 increased by $189 million as compared to 2003 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties of $171 million and unfavorable changes in working capital related to investing activities of $12 million. Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities was $43 million in 2004 versus $57 million in 2003. Cash provided by financing activities for 2004 included long term debt borrowing of $150 million and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $76 million. Cash used by financing activities for 2004 included repayments of long term debt borrowings of $175 million, redemption of all 500 outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock of $50 million and cash dividend payments of $38 million. 29 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures The table below sets out components of total exploration and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, along with the total budgeted for 2006, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2006 2005 2004 2003 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 1,458 $ 1,120 $ 731 Leasehold Acquisitions 131 143 59 Producing Property Acquisitions 56 52 405 Capitalized Interest 15 10 9 Subtotal 1,660 1,325 1,204 Exploration Costs 133 94 76 Dry Hole Costs 65 92 41 Exploration and Development Expenditures 1,858 1,511 1,321 Approximately $2,500 Asset Retirement Costs 20 16 12 (1) Deferred Income Tax on Acquired Properties (17) Total Exploration and Development Expenditures $ 1,878 $ 1,510 $ 1,333 (1)Asset Retirement Costs for 2003 does not include the cumulative effect of adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003. Exploration and development expenditures of $1,858 million for 2005 were $347 million higher than the prior year due primarily to (i) increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $338 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($377 million) and changes in the Canadian exchange rate related to drilling and facilities expenditures ($17 million), partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United Kingdom ($24 million), Trinidad ($21 million) and Canada ($11 million) and; (ii) increased exploration costs ($39 million) primarily in the Barnett Shale area; partially offset by decreased dry hole costs ($27 million). The 2005 exploration and development expenditures of $1,858 million includes $1,300 million in development, $487 million in exploration, $56 million in property acquisitions and $15 million in capitalized interest. The 2004 exploration and development expenditures of $1,511 million includes $1,009 m illion in development, $440 million in exploration, $52 million in property acquisitions and $10 million in capitalized interest. The 2003 exploration and development expenditures of $1,321 million included $651 million in development, $256 million in exploration, $405 million in property acquisitions and $9 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. There are no material continuing commitments associated with current expenditure plans. 30 Derivative Transactions During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. (See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Presented below is a summary of EOGs 2006 natural gas financial collar and price swap contracts at February 22, 2006, with prices expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and notional volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud). As indicated, EOG does not have any financial collar or price swap contracts that cover periods beyond October 2006. As of February 22, 2006, EOG had no crude oil hedges. EOG accounts for these collar and price swap contracts using mark to market accounting.

During 2005, total debt decreased $93 million to $985 million (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of EOGs debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $1,025 million and $1,146 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates currently available to EOG at year end. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2005, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $46 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2005 and 2004, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations. While EOG maintains a $600 million commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2005 was $380 million, and the amount outstanding at year end was zero. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $600 million Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, combined with approximately $688 million of availability under its shelf registration described below, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. In 2005, the short term commercial paper loan balance was reduced by $92 million; the $174 million, 6.00% Notes due 2008 and the remaining $75 million outstanding under the Senior Unsecured Term Loan Facility were repaid primarily with cash generated from operating activities. On February 17, 2006, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid $50 million of the $250 million it borrowed in 2005 (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2006, based on resources available at December 31, 2005, EOG plans to pay off the $126 million, 6.70% Notes due 2006. 31 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 (in thousands): 2012 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 Beyond Current and Long Term Debt $ 985,067 $ 126,075 $ 348,992 $ 220,000 $ 290,000 Non cancelable Operating Leases 84,536 40,440 26,934 8,073 9,089 Interest Payments on Current and Long Term Debt 420,466 58,944 126,424 63,670 171,428 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 273,185 40,752 93,065 59,081 80,287 Drilling Rig Commitments 182,955 75,624 107,331 Seismic Purchase Obligations 3,479 3,479 Other Purchase Obligations 7,072 5,837 1,235 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,956,760 $ 351,151 $ 703,981 $ 350,824 $ 550,804 (1)This table does not include the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties. Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, EOG recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation (see Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, this table does not include EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations (see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2)Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2005. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. Shelf Registration As of February 22, 2006, the amount available under various filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the offer and sale from time to time of EOG debt securities, preferred stock and or common stock totaled approximately $688 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2005, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2005 was the Canadian Dollar. The continued strengthening of the Canadian Dollar in 2005 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries. However, since the Canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. 32 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2005, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $36 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This amount is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Shareholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. In EOGs opinion, overall natural gas production in the United States is declining. In addition, the increasing recognition of natural gas as a more environmentally friendly source of energy is likely to result in increases in demand. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. Assuming a totally unhedged position for 2006, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2006 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price is approximately $24 million for net income and operating cash flow. EOG is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil price. EOGs price sensitivity in 2006 for each $1.00 per barrel change in average wellhead crude oil prices is approximately $6 million for net income and operating cash flow. For information regarding EOGs natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2005, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Marketing companies have played an important role in the United States and Canada natural gas market. These companies aggregate natural gas supplies through purchases from producers like EOG and then resell the gas to end users, local distribution companies or other buyers. In recent years, several of the largest natural gas marketing companies have filed for bankruptcy or are having financial difficulty, and others are exiting this business. EOG does not believe that this will have a material effect on its ability to market its natural gas production. EOG continues to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of partners to whom it sells its production and where appropriate, to seek new markets. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. However, in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, EOG anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the United States and Canada. In addition, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in other exploitation type opportunities. Budgeted 2006 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $2.5 billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOGs strategy of funding the United States and Canada exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition activities primarily from available intern ally generated cash flow. The level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in 2006 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, EOG believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2006 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 33 Environmental Regulations Various federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, affect EOGs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOGs control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the op erator. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOGs overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOGs operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic cond itions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability o f the project is being made. All other exploratory wells that do not meet these criteria are expensed after one year. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. 34 Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depletion, depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies." The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and or property dispositions, and 4) impairments. Stock Options EOG accounted for stock options under the provisions and related interpretations of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." No compensation expense was recognized for such options. As allowed by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" issued in 1995, EOG continued to apply APB Opinion No. 25 for purposes of determining net income and to present the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. 35 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment," which supersedes SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. This eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. EOG adopted SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. EOG expects this will reduce 2006 net earnings by a pre tax amount of approximately $25 million, taking into consideration the estimated forfeitures and cancellations. This amount includes approximately $21 million of expense for unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2005 and approximately $1 million of expense for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires a public entity to present its cash flows provided by tax benefits from stock options exercised in the Financing Cash Flows section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Had SFAS No. 123(R) been in effect, EOGs Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities would have been reduced and its Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities would have been increased on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows by $51 million, $29 million and $12 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding EOGs future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or by comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forward looking stat ements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports and changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOGs success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the avai lability and cost of drilling rigs, experienced drilling crews, materials and equipment used in well completions, and tubular steel; the availability, terms and timing of governmental and other permits and rights of way; the availability of pipeline transportation capacity; the extent to which EOG can economically develop its Barnett Shale acreage outside of Johnson County, Texas; whether EOG is successful in its efforts to more densely develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale and other production areas; political developments around the world; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; weather; and financial market conditions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements might not occur. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 36 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk EOGs exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk is discussed in the Derivative Transactions, Financing, Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Outlook sections of "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity."
