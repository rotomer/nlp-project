ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) is one of the largest independent (non integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, offshore Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common for 2006 of $1,289 million was up 3% compared to 2005 net income available to common of $1,252 million. At December 31, 2006, EOGs total reserves were 6.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 607 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2005. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2006. United States and Canada. EOGs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOGs crude oil and natural gas production. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 79% of total company production in both 2006 and 2005. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2007 production profile to be similar. EOGs major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. International. Although EOG continues to focus on United States and Canada natural gas, EOG sees an increasing linkage between United States and Canada natural gas demand and Trinidad natural gas supply. For example, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from existing and planned facilities in Trinidad are contenders to meet increasing United States natural gas demand. In addition, ammonia, methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the United States and Canada to Trinidad, driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation. EOG believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to two ammonia plants, a methanol plant and the Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) plant will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to United States and Canada natural gas fundamentals. Beginning December 2005, ALNG began taking start up gas and remained in the start up phase through December 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, a subsidiary of EOG, EOG Resources Trinidad Block 4(a) Unlimited, drilled two successful wells on Block 4(a). The subsidiary obtained approval to develop Block 4(a) under a production sharing contract with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago signed in July 2005. A subsidiary of EOG, EOG Resources Trinidad Limited, and the other participants in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block signed a farm out agreement covering the SECC Deep Ibis prospect with BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC (BP) during 2004. The SECC Deep Ibis well spud in April 2006, was drilled to a depth of approximately 19,000 feet and was abandoned and classified as a dry hole in the third quarter of 2006. BP paid the entire cost for drilling the SECC Deep Ibis exploratory well. During 2006, notwithstanding difficulties in accessing rig slots in the Southern Gas Basin of the United Kingdom North Sea, Arthur 3 was drilled and completed and began producing in early third quarter. In addition to EOGs ongoing production from Valkyrie and Arthur Fields, EOG participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f. The Columbus well was a farm in opportunity, and its future appraisal and development is currently being evaluated. 21 Capital Structure One of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOGs peer group. At December 31, 2006, EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 12%, down from 19% at year end 2005. By primarily utilizing cash on hand and cash provided from its operating activities, EOG funded its $2,974 million exploration and development expenditures, paid down $317 million of debt, paid dividends to common shareholders of $60 million and redeemed $47 million of preferred stock. As management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for 2007, EOG believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations. For 2007, EOGs estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately $3.4 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. On September 15, 2006, EOG filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S 3 (New Registration Statement) for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $688,237,500 of EOGs debt securities, preferred stock and common stock. The New Registration Statement was filed to replace EOGs existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2000, under which EOG had sold no securities. As of February 26, 2007, the entire amount registered remains available under the New Registration Statement. On October 11, 2006, EOG commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 100,000 outstanding shares of the 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 Liquidation Preference per share (Series B), at a price of $1,074.01 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase. The tender offer expired on November 8, 2006, and on November 10, 2006, EOG redeemed 46,740 shares of the Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including redemption premium, fees and dividends, of $51 million. EOG has included as a component of preferred dividends the $4 million of premium and fees associated with the redemption of the Series B shares. A total of 53,260 shares of the Series B remain outstanding at December 31, 2006. Stock Based Compensation. EOG adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment" effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective application method and accordingly has not restated any of its prior year results. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), EOG recognized compensation expense for its stock based compensation plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Stock based compensation expense prior to January 1, 2006 consisted of amounts recognized in connection with grants of restricted stock and units. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in EOG recognizing compensation expense on grants made under its employee stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan. For periods subsequent to January 1, 2006, stock based compensation expense is included in the Consolidated Stateme nts of Income based upon job functions of employees receiving the grants. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, EOG compensation expense related to its stock based compensation plans was as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Lease and Well $ 10 $ $ Exploration Costs 11 General and Administrative 29 12 10 Total $ 50 $ 12 $ 10 22 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. Net Operating Revenues During 2006, net operating revenues increased $284 million, or 8%, to $3,904 million from $3,620 million in 2005. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, decreased $42 million, or 1%, to $3,565 million from $3,607 million in 2005. Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 817 718 631 Canada 226 228 212 Trinidad 264 231 186 United Kingdom 30 39 7 Total 1,337 1,216 1,036 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (2) United States $ 6.56 $ 7.86 $ 5.72 Canada 6.41 7.14 5.22 Trinidad 2.44 2.20 (4) 1.51 United Kingdom 7.69 6.99 5.14 Composite 5.74 6.62 4.86 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 20.7 21.5 21.1 Canada 2.5 2.4 2.7 Trinidad 4.8 4.5 3.6 United Kingdom 0.1 0.2 Total 28.1 28.6 27.4 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 62.68 $ 54.57 $ 40.73 Canada 57.32 50.49 37.68 Trinidad 63.87 57.36 39.12 United Kingdom 57.74 49.62 Composite 62.38 54.63 40.22 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 8.5 6.6 4.8 Canada 0.8 0.9 0.8 Total 9.3 7.5 5.6 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 39.95 $ 35.59 $ 27.79 Canada 43.69 35.59 23.23 Composite 40.25 35.59 27.13 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (3) United States 992 886 786 Canada 246 248 233 Trinidad 292 259 207 United Kingdom 31 40 7 Total 1,561 1,433 1,233 Total Bcfe (3) Deliveries 569.9 523.0 451.5 (1)Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable.

Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. (4)Includes $0.23 per Mcf as a result of a revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take or pay contract. 23 2006 compared to 2005. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2006 decreased $136 million, or 5%, to $2,803 million from $2,939 million for 2005 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($407 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take or pay contract ($19 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($290 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 13% to $5.74 per Mcf for 2006 from $6.62 per Mcf in 2005. The Trinidad take or pay contract adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 121 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,337 MMcfd for 2006 from 1,216 MMcfd in 2005. The increase was due to higher production of 99 MMcfd in the United States and 33 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 9 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (83 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (24 MMcfd) and Kansas (7 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in the Gulf of Mexico (16 MMcfd). The decrease in Gulf of Mexico production was partially due to continued shut in production caused by infrastructure damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in Trinidad was due to the commencement of two contracts late in the fourth quarter of 2005 (43 MMcfd) and increased contractual demand (34 MMcfd), partially offset by a decrease in volumes as a result of the December 2005 completion of a cost recovery arrangement (44 MMcfd). The decreas e in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $54 million, or 9%, to $625 million from $571 million as compared to 2005, due to an increase in the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($78 million), partially offset by a decrease in the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($24 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2006 was $62.38 per barrel compared to $54.63 per barrel for 2005. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $40 million, or 41%, to $137 million from $97 million as compared to 2005, due to increases in deliveries ($24 million) and the composite average price ($16 million). During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. 2005 compared to 2004. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2005 increased $1,097 million, or 60%, to $2,939 million from $1,842 million for 2004 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($763 million), increased natural gas deliveries ($315 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take or pay contract ($19 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 36% to $6.62 per Mcf for 2005 from $4.86 per Mcf in 2004. Excluding the aforementioned adjustment, the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 35% to $6.58 per Mcf for 2005. This adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 180 MMcfd, or 17%, to 1,216 MMcfd for 2005 from 1,036 MMcfd in 2004. The increase was due to higher production of 87 MMcfd in the United States, 45 MMcfd in Trinidad, 32 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 16 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (63 MMcfd) and Louisiana (20 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was due to the increased contractual requirements and demand related to the ammonia and methanol plants. The increase in the United Kingdom was due to the commencement of production from the Arthur field in January 2005 (24 MMcfd) and the full year production from the Valkyrie field, which commenced production in August 2004 (8 MMcfd). The increase in Canada was attributable to the drilling program, primarily in the Wapiti, Drumheller and Connorsville areas. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $168 million, or 42%, to $571 million from $403 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($151 million) and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($17 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2005 was $54.63 per barrel compared to $40.22 per barrel for 2004. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $42 million, or 76%, to $97 million from $55 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in the composite average price ($23 million) and deliveries ($19 million). 24 During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. Operating and Other Expenses 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, operating expenses of $2,009 million were $381 million higher than the $1,628 million incurred in 2005. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 Lease and Well $0.66 $0.54 Transportation Costs 0.19 0.17 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) 1.44 1.25 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.29 0.24 Taxes Other Than Income 0.35 0.38 Net Interest Expense 0.08 0.12 Total Per Unit Costs (1) $3.01 $2.70 (1)Total per unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs and impairments. The change in per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A, taxes other than income and net interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOGs oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep, and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $373 million in 2006 were $86 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($34 million) and Canada ($16 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses ($21 million), including stock based compensation expense ($10 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($6 million). Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a down stream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs and transportation fees. Transportation costs of $110 million in 2006 were $23 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. EOGs DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles; drilling or acquisition of new wells; disposition of existing wells; reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance; and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. 25 DD&A expenses of $817 million in 2006 were $163 million higher than 2005 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($56 million) and Trinidad ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($4 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($78 million) and Canada ($11 million), and a downward reserve revision in the United Kingdom ($11 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($9 million). G&A expenses of $165 million in 2006 were $39 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($31 million) and higher insurance costs ($4 million). The increase in employee related costs primarily reflects higher stock based compensation expenses ($17 million). Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Taxes other than income of $201 million in 2006 were $2 million higher than 2005. Severance taxes in the United States decreased primarily due to increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($14 million). Severance/production taxes in Trinidad increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues from crude oil and condensate ($12 million), partially offset by changes to the tax legislation governing the Supplemental Petroleum Tax ($7 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($7 million) and Canada ($2 million). Net interest expense of $43 million in 2006 decreased $19 million compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average debt balance ($9 million), costs in 2005 associated with the early retirement of the 6.00% Notes due 2008 ($8 million), and higher capitalized interest ($5 million). Exploration costs of $155 million in 2006 were $22 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee related costs, including stock based compensation expenses. Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $108 million in 2006 were $30 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments in the United States ($17 million) and Canada ($7 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($4 million) and the United States ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $55 million and $31 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for properties in the United States and Canada. Other income, net was $60 million in 2006 compared to $36 million in 2005. The increase of $24 million was primarily due to higher interest income ($19 million), settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($4 million) and increased net foreign currency transaction gains ($3 million), partially offset by lower gains on sales of properties ($5 million). Income tax provision of $613 million in 2006 decreased $93 million compared to 2005 due primarily to a net decrease in foreign income taxes ($37 million), largely related to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction ($19 million) and an Alberta, Canada corporate tax rate reduction ($13 million), partially offset by a United Kingdom corporate tax rate increase ($7 million); reduced income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 ($24 million); decreased pretax income ($18 million); and reduced state income taxes ($18 million), partially offset by a decrease in the Domestic Production Activities Deduction ($7 million). The effective tax rate for 2006 decreased to 32% from 36% in 2005. 26 2005 compared to 2004. During 2005, operating expenses of $1,628 million were $336 million higher than the $1,292 million incurred in 2004. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.71 $0.60 DD&A 1.25 1.12 G&A 0.24 0.25 Taxes Other Than Income 0.38 0.30 Interest Expense, Net 0.12 0.14 Total Per Unit Costs (1) $2.70 $2.41 (1)Total per unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs and impairments. The per unit rates of lease and well, including transportation, DD&A, taxes other than income and interest expense, net for 2005 compared to 2004 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses, including transportation, of $373 million were $102 million higher than 2004 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($40 million); increased transportation related costs in the United States ($28 million) and the United Kingdom ($7 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($11 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Trinidad ($2 million). DD&A expenses of $654 million in 2005 were $150 million higher than 2004 primarily as a result of increased production in the United States ($46 million), Canada ($6 million) and Trinidad ($5 million) and the commencement of production in the United Kingdom ($14 million). DD&A rates increased in the United States due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties ($59 million) and in Canada predominantly from the development of acquired proved reserves ($9 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($8 million). Taxes other than income of $199 million in 2005 were $65 million higher than 2004. Severance/production taxes increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($41 million), Trinidad ($7 million) and Canada ($3 million), partially offset by the increase in credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($10 million) and a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($5 million). Other items contributing to the increase were an additional Trinidadian Supplemental Petroleum Tax expense as a result of 2005 tax legislation that increased the tax expense retroactively to January 2004 ($7 million) and 2004 production tax relief in Trinidad ($6 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($11 million). Net interest expense in 2005 included costs associated with the early retirement of the 2008 Notes ($8 million) (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding these early retirement costs, the 2005 net interest expense decreased $8 million compared to 2004 primarily due to higher capitalized interest ($5 million), an interest charge related to the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($2 million) and lower average debt balance in the United States ($1 million). Exploration costs of $133 million in 2005 were $39 million higher than 2004 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play. Impairments of $78 million were $4 million lower than 2004 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($12 million) and lower impairments to the carrying value of certain long lived assets in Canada ($8 million), partially offset by higher impairments to the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the United States ($14 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $31 million and $25 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for certain properties in the United States and Canada. Other income, net of $36 million in 2005 increased $26 million compared to 2004 primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of properties ($7 million), interest income ($6 million) and equity income from investments in the Caribbean Nitrogen Company Limited (CNCL) and Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited (N2000) ammonia plants in 2005 27 ($5 million); decreased net foreign currency transaction losses ($4 million); and a gain on the sale of part of EOGs interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in the first quarter of 2005 ($2 million). Income tax provision of $706 million increased $404 million as compared to 2004, due primarily to higher pretax income ($383 million) and income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings ($24 million). The effective tax rate for 2005 increased to 36% from 33% in 2004. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2006 included funds generated from operations, funds from new borrowings, proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan, and proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations, exploration and development expenditures, repayment of debt, dividend payments to shareholders and redemption of preferred stock. 2006 compared to 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,579 million in 2006 increased $209 million compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($205 million), favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($162 million) and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest expense ($54 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($173 million) and a decrease in wellhead revenues ($42 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $2,710 million in 2006 increased by $1,032 million compared to 2005 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($1,094 million) and decreased proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties ($51 million), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($125 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $299 million in 2006 increased $227 million compared to 2005. Cash used by financing activities for 2006 included repayments of long term debt borrowings ($317 million), cash dividend payments ($60 million) and redemption of preferred stock, including premium paid ($50 million). Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 included borrowing under a revolving credit facility ($65 million), proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($36 million) and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation expenses ($28 million). 2005 compared to 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,369 million in 2005 increased $925 million as compared to 2004 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,306 million), a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($93 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($35 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($217 million) and an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($279 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,678 million in 2005 increased by $281 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($308 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($28 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in 2005 ($40 million) and the sale of part of EOGs interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in 2005 ($18 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $72 million in 2005 increased $29 million as compared to 2004. Cash provided by financing activities for 2005 included a long term debt borrowing ($250 million) and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($65 million). Cash used by financing activities for 2005 included repayments of long term debt borrowings ($343 million) and cash dividend payments ($43 million). 28 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures The table below sets out components of total exploration and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, along with the total budgeted for 2007, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2007 2006 2005 2004 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 2,472 $ 1,458 $ 1,120 Leasehold Acquisitions 225 131 143 Producing Property Acquisitions 22 56 52 Capitalized Interest 20 15 10 Subtotal 2,739 1,660 1,325 Exploration Costs 155 133 94 Dry Hole Costs 80 65 92 Exploration and Development Expenditures 2,974 1,858 1,511 Approximately $3,400 Asset Retirement Costs 22 20 16 Deferred Income Tax on Acquired Properties (17) Total Exploration and Development Expenditures $ 2,996 $ 1,878 $ 1,510 Exploration and development expenditures of $2,974 million for 2006 were $1,116 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $1,014 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($843 million), Trinidad ($79 million), Canada ($57 million) and the United Kingdom ($13 million); increased lease acquisitions in the United States ($74 million) and Canada ($16 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($28 million). The 2006 exploration and development expenditures of $2,974 million includes $2,228 million in development, $704 million in exploration, $22 million in property acquisitions and $20 million in capitalized interest. The 2005 exploration and development expenditures of $1,858 million includes $1,300 million in development, $487 million in exploration, $56 million in property acquisitions and $15 million in capitalized interest. The 2004 exploration and development expendi tures of $1,511 million includes $1,009 million in development, $440 million in exploration, $52 million in property acquisitions and $10 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. (See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 29 Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs 2007 natural gas and crude oil financial price swap contracts at February 26, 2007, with prices expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl), as applicable, and notional volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and in barrels per day (Bbld), as applicable. Currently, EOG is not a party to any financial collar contracts. EOG accounts for these price swap contracts using the mark to market accounting method. Financial Price Swap Contracts Natural Gas Crude Oil Weighted Weighted Volume Average Price Volume Average Price Month (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) (Bbld) ($/Bbl) January (closed) 120,000 $10.91 4,000 $78.42 February (1) 120,000 10.93 4,000 78.55 March 120,000 10.75 4,000 78.58 April 120,000 8.81 4,000 78.57 May 120,000 8.65 4,000 78.50 June 120,000 8.74 4,000 78.40 July 120,000 8.84 4,000 78.28 August 120,000 8.92 4,000 78.16 September 120,000 9.00 4,000 78.03 October 120,000 9.14 4,000 77.91 November 120,000 9.94 4,000 77.75 December 120,000 10.70 4,000 77.57 (1) The natural gas contracts for February 2007 are closed. The crude oil contracts for February 2007 will close on February 28, 2007. Financing EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 12% as of December 31, 2006 compared to 19% as of December 31, 2005. During 2006, total debt decreased $252 million to $733 million (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of EOGs debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $754 million and $1,025 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year end. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2006, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $39 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2006 and 2005, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations. While EOG maintains a $600 million commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2006 was $172 million, and the amount outstanding at year end was zero. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $600 million Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, combined with approximately $688 million of availability under its shelf registration described below, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. During 2006, EOG repaid the $126 million, 6.70% Notes due in 2006 primarily with cash generated from operating activities. In 2006, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid $190 million of the $250 million borrowed in 2005 (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The foreign subsidiary has the option to pay off the remaining $60 million of the $250 million borrowed in 2005 at any time prior to maturity. EOG plans to replace the $98 million, 6.50% Notes due 2007 with other long term debt. On October 11, 2006, EOG commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 100,000 outstanding shares of the 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 Liquidation Preference per share (Series B), at a price of $1,074.01 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase. The tender offer expired on November 8, 2006, and on November 10, 2006, EOG redeemed 46,740 shares of the Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including redemption premium, fees and dividends, of 30 $51 million. EOG has included as a component of preferred dividends the $4 million of premium and fees associated with the redemption of the Series B shares. A total of 53,260 shares of the Series B remain outstanding at December 31, 2006. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 (in thousands): 2013 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 Beyond Long Term Debt $ 733,442 $ $ 125,000 $ 318,442 $ 290,000 Non cancelable Operating Leases 189,533 17,627 50,927 29,141 91,838 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 351,416 45,441 102,712 48,270 154,993 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 1,675,148 78,005 478,822 342,990 775,331 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 472,253 229,991 240,372 1,890 Seismic Purchase Obligations 2,322 2,322 Other Purchase Obligations 36,602 35,916 686 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,460,716 $ 409,302 $ 998,519 $ 740,733 $ 1,312,162 (1)This table does not include the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties. In addition, this table does not include EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations (see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2)Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2006. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. Shelf Registration On September 15, 2006, EOG filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S 3 (New Registration Statement) for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $688,237,500 of EOGs debt securities, preferred stock and common stock. The New Registration Statement was filed to replace EOGs existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC in October 2000, under which EOG had sold no securities. As of February 26, 2007, the entire amount registered remains available under the New Registration Statement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other off balance sheet arrangements during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions or arrangements in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2006, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2006 was the Canadian Dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian Dollar in 2006 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries. However, since the Canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. 31 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2006, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $36 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $1 million for the year ended De cember 31, 2006. This amount is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Shareholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. Assuming a totally unhedged position for 2007, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2007 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $27 million for net income and operating cash flow. EOGs price sensitivity in 2007 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price is approximately $6 million for net income and operating cash flow. For information regarding EOGs natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of December 31, 2006, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. However, in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, EOG anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the United States and Canada. In addition, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities. Budgeted 2007 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $3.4 billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOGs strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in 2007 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, EOG believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2007 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOGs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOGs control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such 32 laws and regulations increases EOGs overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOGs operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic cond itions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability o f the project is being made. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future 33 undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depletion, depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies." The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and or property dispositions, and 4) impairments. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, EOG accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment." SFAS No. 123(R) requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award, eliminating the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." In applying the provisions of SFAS 123(R), judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOGs common stock, the level of risk free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOGs stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes cou ld result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 34 Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding EOGs future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or by comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forward looking stat ements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports and changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOGs success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the avai lability and cost of drilling rigs, experienced drilling crews, materials and equipment used in well completions, and tubular steel; the availability, terms and timing of governmental and other permits and rights of way; the availability of pipeline transportation capacity; the availability of compression uplift capacity; the extent to which EOG can economically develop its Barnett Shale acreage outside of Johnson County, Texas; whether EOG is successful in its efforts to more densely develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale and other production areas; political developments around the world; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; weather; and financial market conditions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements might not occur. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of ne w information, future events or otherwise. 35 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk EOGs exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk is discussed in the Derivative Transactions, Financing, Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Outlook sections of "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity."
