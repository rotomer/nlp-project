ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively EOG), is one of the largest independent (non integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, offshore Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common stockholders for 2007 of $1,083 million was down 16% compared to 2006 net income available to common stockholders of $1,289 million. At December 31, 2007, EOGs total reserves were 7.7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 944 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2006. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2007. United States and Canada. EOGs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOGs natural gas and crude oil production. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 83% of total company production in 2007 as compared to 79% in 2006. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2008 production profile to be similar. EOGs major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. In December 2007, EOG entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the Appalachian Basin to a subsidiary of EXCO Resources, Inc., an independent oil and gas company, for approximately $395 million, subject to customary adjustments under the agreement. The Appalachian area being divested includes approximately 2,400 operated wells that accounted for approximately 1% of EOGs total 2007 production and approximately 2% of its total year end 2007 proved reserves. The transaction closed on February 20, 2008. EOG retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area, including rights in the Marcellus Shale, and will continue its shale exploration program. On December 31, 2007, the book value of the assets and liabilities included in the sale were $254 million and $9 million, respectively. International. Although EOG continues to focus on United States and Canada natural gas, EOG continues to see linkage between United States and Canada natural gas demand and Trinidad natural gas supply. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Under the Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) contract, EOG delivered gas at the contractual rate of 30 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd), gross (12 MMcfd, net) beginning in May 2007 when the ALNG plant reached commercial status. In March 2007, EOG acquired the remaining 10% working interest from Primera Block 4(a) Limited, a Trinidadian company, and now holds a 100% working interest in Block 4(a). In July 2007, EOG executed a 15 year natural gas contract with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) for the sale of approximately 100 MMcfd, gross (78 MMcfd, net to EOG, based on current pricing and operating assumptions). EOG expects to begin initial delivery under this contract in early 2010 from its first discovery on Block 4(a), subject to the completion of a pipeline by NGC. In May 2007, EOG acquired the remainder of the interest in the Modified U(b) Block from Primera Oil & Gas Ltd., a Trinidadian company, and now holds a 100% working interest in the Modified U(b) Block. In August 2007, EOG drilled the U(b) 2 exploratory well on the Modified U(b) Block, and the well was determined to be non commercial. In 2007, EOG agreed to purchase an 80% interest in the Pelican field facilities from the subsidiaries of the other participants in the South East Coast Consortium Block. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008. During 2007, EOG executed a one year term sheet, effective July 1, 2007, with the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago that sets forth the pricing for the sales of crude oil and condensate produced in Trinidad. The pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin. This term sheet replaces the pricing provisions of a previous crude oil and condensate sales contract 23 that expired on June 30, 2007 and will be incorporated into a new crude oil and condensate sales contract which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2008. In addition to EOGs ongoing production from the Valkyrie and Arthur Fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, EOG participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f, at the end of 2006. In 2007, a successful appraisal well was drilled on this prospect. The future development of this prospect is currently being evaluated. EOG also participated in the drilling of an unsuccessful exploratory well in August 2007 on the Eos prospect located in the Southern North Sea Block 45/11c. EOG continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified. Capital Structure One of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOGs peer group. At December 31, 2007, EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 14%, up from 12% at year end 2006. By primarily utilizing cash on hand, cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from long term debt borrowings, EOG funded $3.9 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures, paid down $158 million of debt, paid dividends to common and preferred stockholders of $84 million and paid $51 million for the redemption of preferred stock. As management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for 2008, EOG believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations. For 2008, EOGs budget for exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures is approximately $4.4 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. On September 10, 2007, EOG completed its public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 (2017 Notes). Interest on the 2017 Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2008. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $595 million and were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. On September 15, 2006, EOG filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S 3 (New Registration Statement) for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $688,237,500 of EOGs debt securities, preferred stock and or common stock. The New Registration Statement was filed to replace EOGs then existing shelf registration statement which had been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2000 and under which EOG had sold no securities. As of December 31, 2007, and as a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, EOG may offer and sell up to $88,237,500 of debt securities, preferred stock and or common stock under the New Registration Statement. In 2007, EOG repurchased a total of 48,260 shares of its outstanding 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 liquidation preference per share (Series B), for an aggregate purchase price, including premium and fees, of $51 million, plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase. EOG has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the $3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases. At December 31, 2007, 5,000 shares of the Series B with a book value of $5 million remained outstanding. Such remaining shares were subsequently repurchased in January 2008. See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 Stock Based Compensation. EOG adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment" effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective application method and accordingly has not restated any of its prior year results. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock based compensation expense is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income based upon job functions of employees receiving the grants. EOG compensation expense related to its stock based compensation plans for the years ended December 31, was as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Lease and Well $ 14 $ 10 $ Exploration Costs 13 11 General and Administrative 40 29 12 Total $ 67 $ 50 $ 12 25 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. Net Operating Revenues During 2007, net operating revenues increased $278 million, or 7%, to $4,191 million from $3,913 million in 2006. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, increased $474 million, or 13%, to $4,039 million from $3,565 million in 2006. Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) United States 971 817 718 Canada 224 226 228 Trinidad 252 264 231 United Kingdom 23 30 39 Total 1,470 1,337 1,216 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (1) United States $ 6.32 $ 6.56 $ 7.86 Canada 6.25 6.41 7.14 Trinidad 2.71 2.44 2.20 United Kingdom 6.19 7.69 6.99 Composite 5.69 5.74 6.62 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (2) United States 24.6 20.7 21.5 Canada 2.4 2.5 2.4 Trinidad 4.1 4.8 4.5 United Kingdom 0.1 0.1 0.2 Total 31.2 28.1 28.6 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (1) United States $ 68.85 $ 62.68 $ 54.57 Canada 65.27 57.32 50.49 Trinidad 69.84 63.87 57.36 United Kingdom 66.84 57.74 49.62 Composite 68.69 62.38 54.63 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (2) United States 11.1 8.5 6.6 Canada 1.1 0.8 0.9 Total 12.2 9.3 7.5 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (1) United States $ 47.63 $ 39.95 $ 35.59 Canada 44.54 43.69 35.59 Composite 47.36 40.25 35.59 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (3) United States 1,184 992 886 Canada 245 246 248 Trinidad 276 292 259 United Kingdom 24 31 40 Total 1,729 1,561 1,433 Total Bcfe (3) Deliveries 631.3 569.9 523.0 (1)Dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel, as applicable. (2)Thousand barrels per day. (3)Million cubic feet equivalent per day; includes natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. 26 2007 compared to 2006. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2007 increased $248 million, or 9%, to $3,051 million from $2,803 million for 2006 due to increased natural gas deliveries ($278 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($30 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased to $5.69 per Mcf for 2007 from $5.74 per Mcf in 2006. Natural gas deliveries increased 133 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,470 MMcfd for 2007 from 1,337 MMcfd in 2006. The increase was due to higher production of 154 MMcfd in the United States, partially offset by lower production of 12 MMcfd in Trinidad, 7 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (119 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (13 MMcfd), Kansas (13 MMcfd) and Mississippi (10 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was due to reduced 2007 deliveries to ALNG (10 MMcfd) and a decrease in contractual demand (2 MMcfd). During 2006, EOG supplied gas for use in ALNGs start up phase. In 2007, ALNG remained in the start up phase, but did not require any gas from EOG until May 2007 when ALNG reached commercial status and EOG began supplying gas under the ALNG take or pay contract. The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fie lds. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $153 million, or 24%, to $778 million from $625 million as compared to 2006, due to an increase in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($81 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($72 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota. The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2007 was $68.69 per barrel compared to $62.38 per barrel for 2006. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $73 million, or 53%, to $210 million from $137 million as compared to 2006, due to increases in deliveries ($42 million) and the composite average price ($31 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and South Texas areas. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. 2006 compared to 2005. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2006 decreased $136 million, or 5%, to $2,803 million from $2,939 million for 2005 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($407 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take or pay contract ($19 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($290 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 13% to $5.74 per Mcf for 2006 from $6.62 per Mcf in 2005. The Trinidad take or pay contract adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 121 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,337 MMcfd for 2006 from 1,216 MMcfd in 2005. The increase was due to higher production of 99 MMcfd in the United States and 33 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 9 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (83 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (24 MMcfd) and Kansas (7 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in the Gulf of Mexico (16 MMcfd). The decrease in Gulf of Mexico production was partially due to continued shut in production caused by infrastructure damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in Trinidad was due to the commencement of two contracts late in the fourth quarter of 2005 (43 MMcfd) and increased contractual demand (34 MMcfd), partially offset by a decrease in volumes as a result of the December 2005 completion of a cost recovery arrangement (44 MMcfd). The decreas e in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $54 million, or 9%, to $625 million from $571 million as compared to 2005, due to an increase in the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($78 million), partially offset by a decrease in the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($24 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2006 was $62.38 per barrel compared to $54.63 per barrel for 2005. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $40 million, or 41%, to $137 million from $97 million as compared to 2005, due to increases in deliveries ($24 million) and the composite average price ($16 million). 27 During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. Operating and Other Expenses 2007 compared to 2006. During 2007, operating expenses of $2,542 million were $533 million higher than the $2,009 million incurred in 2006. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 Lease and Well $0.76 $0.66 Transportation Costs 0.27 0.19 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) 1.69 1.44 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.33 0.29 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.08 Total Per Unit Costs (1) $3.12 $2.66 (1)Total per unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOGs oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep, and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $480 million in 2007 were $107 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($62 million) and Canada ($13 million), higher lease and well administrative expenses ($18 million), higher workover expenditures in the United States ($7 million) and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($7 million). Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a down stream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs and transportation fees. Transportation costs of $170 million in 2007 were $60 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play and related costs associated with new marketing arrangements to transport the increased production to new downstream markets. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. EOGs DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. 28 DD&A expenses of $1,066 million in 2007 were $248 million higher than 2006 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($122 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($5 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($102 million), Canada ($17 million) and in the United Kingdom ($2 million). The exchange rates in Canada ($10 million) and in the United Kingdom ($2 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. G&A expenses of $205 million in 2007 were $40 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($24 million), legal settlement costs ($4 million), insurance costs ($3 million) and office rent ($2 million). The increase in employee related costs primarily reflects higher stock based compensation expenses ($11 million). Net interest expense of $47 million in 2007 increased $4 million compared to 2006 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($13 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($9 million). Exploration costs of $150 million in 2007 were $5 million lower than 2006 due primarily to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $148 million in 2007 were $39 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments ($27 million) and increased amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($7 million), the United Kingdom ($3 million) and Canada ($3 million). The increase in SFAS No. 144 related impairments is due to an increase in Canada ($15 million) primarily related to the Northwest Territories discovery (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements) and an increase in the United States ($12 million). Under SFAS No. 144, EOG recorded impairments of $82 million and $55 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are determined based on wellhead revenue and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2007 increased $7 million to $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $201 million (5.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2006. Severance/production taxes increased primarily due to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($27 million) and Trinidad ($2 million), partially offset by increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($26 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in Canada ($2 million). Other income, net was $29 million in 2007 compared to $52 million in 2006. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to lower interest income ($17 million), lower settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($3 million) and lower equity income from the Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited ammonia plant ($2 million). Income tax provision of $541 million in 2007 decreased $72 million compared to 2006 due primarily to decreased pretax income ($99 million), partially offset by higher foreign income taxes ($10 million) and increased state income taxes ($7 million). The net effective tax rate for 2007 increased to 33% from 32% in 2006. 29 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, operating expenses of $2,009 million were $381 million higher than the $1,628 million incurred in 2005. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 Lease and Well $0.66 $0.54 Transportation Costs 0.19 0.17 DD&A 1.44 1.25 G&A 0.29 0.24 Net Interest Expense 0.08 0.12 Total Per Unit Costs (1) $2.66 $2.32 (1)Total per unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments and taxes other than income. The change in per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $373 million in 2006 were $86 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($34 million) and Canada ($16 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses ($21 million), including stock based compensation expense ($10 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($6 million). Transportation costs of $110 million in 2006 were $23 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play. DD&A expenses of $817 million in 2006 were $163 million higher than 2005 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($56 million) and Trinidad ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($4 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($78 million) and Canada ($11 million), and a downward reserve revision in the United Kingdom ($11 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($9 million). G&A expenses of $165 million in 2006 were $39 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($31 million) and higher insurance costs ($4 million). The increase in employee related costs primarily reflects higher stock based compensation expenses ($17 million). Net interest expense of $43 million in 2006 decreased $19 million compared to 2005 primarily due to a lower average debt balance ($9 million), costs in 2005 associated with the early retirement of the 6.00% Notes due 2008 ($8 million), and higher capitalized interest ($5 million). Exploration costs of $155 million in 2006 were $22 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee related costs, including stock based compensation expenses. Impairments of $108 million in 2006 were $30 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments in the United States ($17 million) and Canada ($7 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($4 million) and the United States ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $55 million and $31 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for properties in the United States and Canada. Taxes other than income of $201 million in 2006 were $2 million higher than 2005. Severance taxes in the United States decreased primarily due to increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($14 million). Severance/production taxes in Trinidad increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues from crude oil and condensate ($12 million), partially offset by changes to the tax legislation governing the Supplemental Petroleum Tax ($7 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($7 million) and Canada ($2 million). 30 Other income, net was $52 million in 2006 compared to $23 million in 2005. The increase of $29 million was primarily due to higher interest income ($19 million), settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($4 million) and increased net foreign currency transaction gains ($3 million). Income tax provision of $613 million in 2006 decreased $93 million compared to 2005 due primarily to a net decrease in foreign income taxes ($37 million), largely related to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction ($19 million) and an Alberta, Canada corporate tax rate reduction ($13 million), partially offset by a United Kingdom corporate tax rate increase ($7 million); reduced income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 ($24 million); decreased pretax income ($18 million); and reduced state income taxes ($18 million), partially offset by a decrease in the Domestic Production Activities Deduction ($7 million). The effective tax rate for 2006 decreased to 32% from 36% in 2005. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2007 were funds generated from operations, the issuance of long term debt, proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plans, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, net commercial paper, other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facility borrowings. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; redemptions of preferred stock and debt issuance costs. 2007 compared to 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,893 million in 2007 increased $315 million compared to 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($474 million) and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($157 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($180 million), a decrease in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($87 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($55 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,456 million in 2007 increased by $745 million compared to 2006 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities was $394 million in 2007 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $299 million in 2006. Cash provided by financing activities for 2007 included the issuance of long term debt ($600 million), proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans ($55 million), excess tax benefits from stock based compensation ($27 million) and Trinidad revolving credit facility borrowings ($10 million). Cash used by financing activities for 2007 included repayments of long term borrowings ($158 million), cash dividend payments ($84 million), redemptions of preferred stock ($51 million) and debt issuance costs ($5 million). 2006 compared to 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,579 million in 2006 increased $209 million compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($205 million), favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($162 million) and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest expense ($54 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($173 million) and a decrease in wellhead revenues ($42 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $2,710 million in 2006 increased by $1,032 million compared to 2005 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($1,094 million) and decreased proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties ($51 million), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($125 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $299 million in 2006 increased $227 million compared to 2005. Cash used by financing activities for 2006 included repayments of long term debt borrowings ($317 million), cash dividend payments ($60 million) and redemption of preferred stock, including premium paid ($50 million). Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 included borrowing under a revolving credit facility ($65 million), 31 proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($36 million) and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation expenses ($28 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, along with the total budgeted for 2008, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2008 2007 2006 2005 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 2,976 $ 2,403 $ 1,418 Leasehold Acquisitions 278 225 131 Producing Property Acquisitions 20 22 56 Capitalized Interest 29 20 15 Subtotal 3,303 2,670 1,620 Exploration Costs 150 155 133 Dry Hole Costs 115 80 65 Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,568 2,905 1,818 Approximately $4,100 Asset Retirement Costs 31 22 20 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,599 2,927 1,838 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 277 100 63 Approximately $280 Total Expenditures $ 3,876 $ 3,027 $ 1,901 Exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million for 2007 were $663 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $573 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($648 million); increased lease acquisitions in the United States ($57 million); increased dry hole costs in the United States ($19 million), Trinidad ($9 million) and the United Kingdom ($7 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($18 million); and increased capitalized interest in the United States ($8 million). These increases were partially offset by lower drilling and facilities expenditures in Canada ($70 million), the United Kingdom ($12 million) and Trinidad ($7 million); decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($7 million); and decreased lease acquisitions in the United Kingdom ($6 million). The 2007 exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million includes $2 ,681 million in development, $838 million in exploration, $29 million in capitalized interest and $20 million in property acquisitions. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering systems and processing plants in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2006 exploration and development expenditures of $2,905 million includes $2,159 million in development, $704 million in exploration, $22 million in property acquisitions and $20 million in capitalized interest. The 2005 exploration and development expenditures of $1,818 million includes $1,260 million in development, $487 million in exploration, $56 million in property acquisitions and $15 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs 2008 and 2009 natural gas and crude oil financial price swap contracts at February 27, 2008, with notional volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and in barrels per day (Bbld), as applicable, and prices expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl), as applicable. Currently, EOG is not a party to any financial collar contracts. EOG accounts for these price swap contracts using the mark to market accounting method.

The crude oil contracts for February 2008 will close on February 29, 2008. Financing EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 14% at December 31, 2007 compared to 12% at December 31, 2006. During 2007, total debt increased $452 million to $1,185 million (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of EOGs debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $1,227 million and $754 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year end. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2007, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in an $83 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2007 and 2006, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facility borrowings to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $1.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2007 was $590 million, and the amount outstanding at year end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted 33 credit facilities during 2007 was $123 million with no amounts outstanding at year end. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, combined with approximately $88 million of availability under its shelf registration described below, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. During September 2007, EOG issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 2017 Notes. Net proceeds of approximately $595 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. In December 2007, EOG repaid, at maturity, the remaining $98 million principal amount of its 6.50% Notes due in 2007. Also during 2007, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid the remaining $60 million year end 2006 outstanding balance of its $600 million, 3 year unsecured Senior Term Loan Agreement. EOG had previously terminated its remaining borrowing capacity under the Senior Term Loan Agreement. In 2007, EOG repurchased a total of 48,260 shares of its outstanding Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including premium and fees, of $51 million, plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase. EOG has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the $3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases. At December 31, 2007, 5,000 shares of the Series B with a book value of $5 million remained outstanding. Such remaining shares were subsequently repurchased in January 2008. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 (in thousands): 2013 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Beyond Long Term Debt $ 1,185,000 $ $ 75,000 $ 220,000 $ 890,000 Non Cancelable Operating Leases 211,654 28,472 42,305 33,881 106,996 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 656,628 71,105 135,510 118,770 331,243 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 1,928,603 149,495 385,862 377,473 1,015,773 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 380,004 200,878 178,291 835 Seismic Purchase Obligations 3,027 3,027 Other Purchase Obligations 30,767 30,767 Total Contractual Obligations $ 4,395,683 $ 483,744 $ 816,968 $ 750,959 $ 2,344,012 (1)This table does not include the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties. In addition, this table does not include EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations (see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2)Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2007. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S K) during any of the periods in this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. 34 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2007, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2007 was the Canadian Dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian Dollar in 2007 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries. However, since the Canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2007, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $58 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. The market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate in 2008 will impact the level of EOGs 2008 total capital expenditures as well as its production. Including the impact of EOGs 2008 natural gas and crude oil hedges, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2008 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $20 million for net income and operating cash flow. EOGs price sensitivity in 2008 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids prices, is approximately $10 million for net income and operating cash flow. For information regarding EOGs natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of December 31, 2007, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In 2008, EOG expects to allocate an increased amount of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and the Rocky Mountain operating area which includes the Uinta Basin and the North Dakota Bakken. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG anticipates continuing to expend a portion of its available funds in the further development of Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. In addition, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities. Budgeted 2008 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $4.1 billion. In addition, budgeted 2008 expenditures for na tural gas gathering and processing and other assets are approximately $280 million. The total 2008 capital expenditures budget of $4.4 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOGs strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of total capital expenditures may vary in 2008 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, EOG believes net operating cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and available financing alternatives in 2008 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition 35 expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Operations. Based on average North American natural gas prices of $7.50 per Mcf at Henry Hub and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, EOG expects to increase overall production in 2008 by 15% over 2007 levels. United States production is expected to increase by 19%, with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 36% and 40%, respectively. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOGs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations, and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOGs control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOGs overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOGs operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. EOG is aware of the increasing focus of national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change issues. We are also aware of legislation, recently proposed by the Canadian legislature, to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, proposed United States policy, legislation or regulatory actions may also address GHG emissions. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we are operating to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic cond itions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. 36 Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient t o justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a property by property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies." The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and or property dispositions and 4) impairments. 37 Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, EOG accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment." In applying the provisions of SFAS 123(R), judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOGs common stock, the level of risk free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOGs stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding EOGs future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forwar d looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOGs forward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and financial market conditions; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol; the extent of EOGs success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the ability to achieve production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reservoir performance; the availability and cost of drilling rigs, experienced drilling crews, tubular steel and other materials, equipment and services used in drilling and well completions; the availability, terms and timing of mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; access to surface locations for drilling and production facilities; the availability and capacity of gathering, processing and pipeline transportation facilities; the availability of compression uplift capacity; the extent to which EOG can economically develop its Barnett Shale acreage outside of Johnson County, Texas; whether EOG is successful in its efforts to more densely develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale and other production areas; political developments around the world and the enactment of new government policies, legislation and regulations, including environmental regulations; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and weather, including weather related delays in the installation of gathering and production facilities. 38 In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements may not occur. EOGs forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
