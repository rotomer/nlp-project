ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom North Sea and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common stockholders for 2008 of $2,436 million was up 125% compared to 2007 net income available to common stockholders of $1,083 million. At December 31, 2008, EOGs total reserves were 8.7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 944 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2007. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2008. United States and Canada. EOGs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOGs natural gas and crude oil production. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 87% of total company production in 2008 as compared to 83% in 2007. In 2008, the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and North Dakota Bakken areas produced an increasing amount of crude oil and natural gas liquids. For 2008, crude oil and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 19% of total company production as compared to 15% for 2007. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2009 crude oil and natural gas liquids production to increase as compared to 2008. EOGs major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico , North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. In February 2008, EOG closed on the sale of the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the Appalachian Basin to a subsidiary of EXCO Resources, Inc., an independent oil and gas company, for approximately $386 million ($40 million of which was received in 2007). The Appalachian area that was divested included approximately 2,400 operated wells that accounted for approximately 1% of EOGs total 2007 production and approximately 2% of its total year end 2007 proved reserves. EOG retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area, including rights in the Marcellus Shale, and continued its shale exploration program in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, EOG commenced production in its British Columbia, Canada shale gas play. EOG holds approximately 158,000 net acres in this play at December 31, 2008 and expects to slowly increase production until 2012, when the construction of additional infrastructure for the play is expected to be completed. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. In February 2008, EOG, through its subsidiary EOG Resources Trinidad Limited (EOGRT) purchased an 80% working interest in the exploration and production license covering the Pelican field and its related facilities from Trinidad and Tobago Marine Petroleum Company Limited. The acquisition includes the subsurface rights, offshore facilities, the condensate transport line and the onshore storage facilities. In October 2008, EOG, through its subsidiaries, EOGRT, EOG Resources Trinidad U(a) Block Limited and EOG Resources Trinidad U(b) Block Unlimited (EOGRT U(b)), finalized crude oil and condensate sales contracts with the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago. The pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin. In April 2008, EOGs subsidiary, EOG Resources Trinidad LRL Unlimited, relinquished its rights to Lower Reverse "L" Block and recorded an impairment of $20 million. In December 2008, EOG, through its subsidiaries EOGRT and EOGRT U(b), began production from the Oilbird field. 26 EOG continues to expand its exploration prospect portfolio in the United Kingdom (U.K.) in addition to its ongoing production from the Valkyrie and Arthur fields in the Southern Gas Basin of the North Sea Block 23/16f. There are currently two producing wells in the Arthur field, one or both of which could cease production during the second half of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2008, EOG recorded an impairment of $6 million ($3 million after tax) for its Arthur field based on well performance. During 2008, a field development plan was submitted for the Columbus discovery in the Central North Sea. In the fourth quarter of 2008, EOGUK was awarded three Central North Sea operated licenses in the U.K. 25th Seaward Licensing Round. A rig was contracted to drill two operated wells in the East Irish Sea in 2009. The licenses for the East Irish Sea were awarded to EOG in 2007. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, The Peoples Republic of China. The acquisition includes production of approximately 9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net, on approximately 130,000 acres. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to additional zones on the acreage purchased. EOG plans to drill its first horizontal well in 2009. EOG continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified. Capital Structure One of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOGs peer group. At December 31, 2008, EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 17%. During 2008, EOG funded $5.4 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures, paid $115 million in dividends to common and preferred stockholders, repaid $38 million of debt and paid $5 million for the redemption of all remaining shares of its outstanding 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 liquidation preference per share (Series B), primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds from long term debt borrowings and proceeds from the sale of its Appalachian assets. For 2009, EOGs budget for exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures is approximately $3.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada crude oil and natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures. EOG intends to manage the 2009 capital budget in order to balance expenditures with operating cash flows. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. On September 30, 2008, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $743 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. 27 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. Net Operating Revenues During 2008, net operating revenues increased $2,888 million, or 68%, to $7,127 million from $4,239 million in 2007. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOGs production of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids, increased $2,202 million, or 55%, to $6,222 million from $4,020 million in 2007. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $598 million compared to net gains of $93 million in 2007. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third party natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third party natural gas, increased $91 million, or 124%, to $165 million in 2008 from $74 million in 2007. Other, net operating revenues in 2008 primarily consist of the gain of $128 million on the sale of the Appalachian assets in February 2008. The following review of ope rations gives effect to the reclassifications discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,162 971 817 Canada 222 224 226 Trinidad 218 252 264 Other International (2) 17 23 30 Total 1,619 1,470 1,337 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 8.22 $ 6.27 $ 6.52 Canada 7.64 6.25 6.41 Trinidad 3.58 2.71 2.44 Other International (2) 8.18 6.19 7.69 Composite 7.51 5.65 5.72 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 39.5 24.6 20.7 Canada 2.7 2.4 2.5 Trinidad 3.2 4.1 4.8 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 45.5 31.2 28.1 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 87.68 $ 68.85 $ 62.68 Canada 89.70 65.27 57.32 Trinidad 92.90 69.84 63.87 Other International (2) 99.30 66.84 57.74 Composite 88.18 68.69 62.38 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 15.0 11.1 8.5 Canada 1.0 1.1 0.8 Total 16.0 12.2 9.3 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 53.33 $ 47.63 $ 39.95 Canada 54.77 44.54 43.69 Composite 53.42 47.36 40.25 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (4) United States 1,490 1,184 992 Canada 244 245 246 Trinidad 237 276 292 Other International (2) 17 24 31 Total 1,988 1,729 1,561 Total Bcfe (4) 727.6 631.3 569.9 (1)Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable.

(4)Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids. Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids. 29 2008 compared to 2007. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2008 increased $1,419 million, or 47%, to $4,452 million from $3,033 million for 2007 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($1,101 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($318 million). EOGs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 33% to $7.51 per Mcf in 2008 from $5.65 per Mcf in 2007. Natural gas deliveries increased 149 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,619 MMcfd in 2008 from 1,470 MMcfd in 2007. The increase was due to higher production of 191 MMcfd in the United States and initial production of 5 MMcfd in China, partially offset by lower production of 34 MMcfd in Trinidad, 11 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (140 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (54 MMcfd), Mississippi (8 MMcfd) and Kansas (4 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production due to the February 2008 sale of the Appalachian assets (15 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was primarily due to decreased deliveries as a result of plant shutdowns due to unplanned maintenance activities (29 MMcfd) and reduced deliveries due to lower demand in 2008 (10 MMcfd), partially offset by increased deliveries to Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) (5 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of pr oduction declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $680 million, or 87%, to $1,458 million in 2008 from $778 million in 2007, due to an increase of 14.3 MBbld, or 46%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($358 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($322 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (12 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2008 increased 28% to $88.18 per barrel compared to $68.69 per barrel for 2007. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $102 million, or 49%, to $312 million in 2008 from $210 million in 2007, due to increases in deliveries ($67 million) and a higher composite average price ($35 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2008 increased 13% to $53.42 per barrel compared to $47.36 per barrel for 2007. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included realized losses of $137 million. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third party natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third party natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, substantially all of such revenues were related to sales of third party natural gas. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third party natural gas and the associated transportation costs. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs increased $5 million to $12 million in 2008 compared to $7 million in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. 2007 compared to 2006. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2007 increased $240 million, or 9%, to $3,033 million from $2,793 million in 2006 due to increased natural gas deliveries ($277 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($37 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased to $5.65 per Mcf in 2007 from $5.72 per Mcf in 2006. Natural gas deliveries increased 133 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,470 MMcfd in 2007 from 1,337 MMcfd in 2006. The increase was due to higher production of 154 MMcfd in the United States, partially offset by lower production of 12 MMcfd in Trinidad, 7 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (119 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (13 MMcfd), Kansas (13 MMcfd) and Mississippi (10 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was due to reduced 2007 deliveries to ALNG (10 MMcfd) and a decrease in contractual demand (2 MMcfd). During 2006, EOG supplied gas for use in ALNGs start up phase. In 2007, ALNG remained in the start up phase, but did not require any gas from EOG until May 2007 when ALNG reached commercial status and EOG began supplying gas under the ALNG take or pay contract. The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fiel ds. 30 Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $153 million, or 24%, to $778 million in 2007 from $625 million in 2006, due to an increase in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($81 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($72 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota. The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price in 2007 was $68.69 per barrel compared to $62.38 per barrel in 2006. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $73 million, or 53%, to $210 million in 2007 from $137 million in 2006, due to increases in deliveries ($42 million) and a higher composite average price ($31 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and South Texas areas. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2007 increased $4 million to $7 million in 2007 from $3 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increased natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. Operating and Other Expenses 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, operating expenses of $3,360 million were $769 million higher than the $2,591 million incurred in 2007. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 Lease and Well $ 0.77 $ 0.72 Transportation Costs 0.38 0.24 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) Oil and Gas Properties 1.74 1.63 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.09 0.06 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.34 0.33 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.07 Total Per Unit Costs (1) $ 3.39 $ 3.05 (1)Total per unit costs do not include gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2008 as compared to 2007 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOGs crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other expenses, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $559 million in 2008 increased $107 million from $452 million in 2007 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses ($78 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($28 million), both in the United States. 31 Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs and transportation fees. Transportation costs of $274 million in 2008 increased $122 million from $152 million in 2007 primarily due to increased production and costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($64 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($38 million) to downstream markets. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. EOGs DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consist of natural gas gathering and processing facilities, compressors, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2008 increased $261 million to $1,327 million from $1,066 million in 2007. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $236 million higher than in 2007 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($210 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($10 million) and in Trinidad ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($15 million) and Canada ($8 million). Changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($11 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $25 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. G&A expenses of $244 million in 2008 were $38 million higher than 2007 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($33 million). The increase in employee related costs primarily reflects higher stock based compensation expenses ($18 million). Net interest expense of $52 million in 2008 increased $5 million from $47 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($18 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($13 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operation and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOGs natural gas gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $13 million to $41 million in 2008 as compared to $28 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. Exploration costs of $194 million in 2008 increased $44 million from $150 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($27 million) and higher employee related costs ($15 million). The increase in geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States was primarily attributable to activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($21 million). Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144), which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $193 million in 2008 were $45 million higher than impairments of $148 million in 2007 due primarily to increased amortization costs as a result of increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($30 million) and Canada ($12 million), an SFAS No. 144 related impairment in Trinidad as a result of EOGs relinquishment of its rights to Lower Reverse "L" Block ($20 million) and an SFAS No. 144 related 32 impairment in the United Kingdom for the Arthur field ($6 million), partially offset by decreased SFAS No. 144 related impairments in Canada ($20 million). Under SFAS No. 144, EOG recorded impairments of $86 million and $82 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are determined based on wellhead revenue and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2008 increased $113 million to $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2007 primarily due to an increase in severance/production taxes in the United States as a result of increased wellhead revenues ($86 million), a decrease in credits taken in 2008 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($13 million) and increased ad valorem/property taxes as a result of higher property valuations in the United States ($20 million). Income tax provision of $1,310 million in 2008 increased $769 million compared to 2007 due primarily to increased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2008 increased to 35% from 33% in 2007. The increase in the 2008 net effective tax rate is primarily due to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction in 2007. 2007 compared to 2006. During 2007, operating expenses of $2,591 million were $566 million higher than the $2,025 million incurred in 2006. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 Lease and Well $ 0.72 $ 0.63 Transportation Costs 0.24 0.18 DD&A Oil and Gas Properties 1.63 1.39 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.06 0.05 G&A 0.33 0.29 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.08 Total Per Unit Costs (1) $ 3.05 $ 2.62 (1)Total per unit costs do not include gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $452 million in 2007 were $96 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($53 million) and Canada ($13 million), higher lease and well administrative expenses ($17 million), higher workover expenditures in the United States ($7 million) and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($7 million). Transportation costs of $152 million in 2007 were $52 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale Play and related costs associated with new marketing arrangements to transport the increased production to new downstream markets. DD&A expenses in 2007 increased $248 million to $1,066 million from $817 million in 2006. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $235 million higher than in 2006 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($117 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($5 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($93 million), Canada ($18 million) and in the United Kingdom ($2 million). Changes in the exchange rates in Canada ($10 million) and in the United Kingdom ($1 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. 33 DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $13 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. G&A expenses of $205 million in 2007 were $40 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($24 million), legal settlement costs ($4 million), insurance costs ($3 million) and office rent ($2 million). The increase in employee related costs primarily reflects higher stock based compensation expenses ($11 million). Net interest expense of $47 million in 2007 increased $4 million compared to 2006 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($13 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($9 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $10 million to $28 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase primarily reflects increased activity in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. Exploration costs of $150 million in 2007 were $5 million lower than 2006 due primarily to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments of $148 million in 2007 were $39 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments ($27 million) and increased amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($7 million), the United Kingdom ($3 million) and Canada ($3 million). The increase in SFAS No. 144 related impairments is due to an increase in Canada ($15 million) primarily related to the Northwest Territories discovery (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements) and an increase in the United States ($12 million). Under SFAS No. 144, EOG recorded impairments of $82 million and $55 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Taxes other than income in 2007 increased $7 million to $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $201 million (5.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2006. Severance/production taxes increased primarily due to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($27 million) and Trinidad ($2 million), partially offset by increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($26 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in Canada ($2 million). Other income, net was $29 million in 2007 compared to $52 million in 2006. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to lower interest income ($17 million), lower settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($3 million) and lower equity income from the Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited ammonia plant ($2 million). Income tax provision of $541 million in 2007 decreased $72 million compared to 2006 due primarily to decreased pretax income ($99 million), partially offset by higher foreign income taxes ($10 million) and increased state income taxes ($7 million). The net effective tax rate for 2007 increased to 33% from 32% in 2006. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2008 were funds generated from operations, the issuance of long term debt, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; redemptions of preferred stock and debt issuance costs. 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,633 million in 2008 increased $1,732 million from $2,901 million in 2007 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,202 million); favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($170 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($91 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($50 million); partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($404 million); an increase in marketing costs ($86 million); an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($265 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($9 million). 34 Net cash used in investing activities of $4,967 million in 2008 increased by $1,511 million from $3,456 million for the same period of 2007 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,317 million), unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($296 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($199 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($300 million), primarily reflecting net proceeds from the sale of EOGs Appalachian assets. Net cash provided by financing activities was $645 million in 2008 compared to $386 million in 2007. Cash provided by financing activities for 2008 included the issuance of long term debt ($750 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($73 million) and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation ($6 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2008 included cash dividend payments ($115 million), Trinidad revolving credit facility repayment ($38 million), treasury stock purchases ($18 million), debt issuance costs ($8 million) and the redemption of preferred stock ($5 million). 2007 compared to 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,901 million in 2007 increased $305 million compared to 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($466 million); a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($157 million); and an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($44 million); partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($172 million); an increase in marketing costs ($40 million); a decrease in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($87 million); and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($65 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,456 million in 2007 increased by $745 million compared to 2006 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($652 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($177 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($63 million). Net cash provided by financing activities was $386 million in 2007 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $316 million in 2006. Cash provided by financing activities for 2007 included the issuance of long term debt ($600 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($55 million), excess tax benefits from stock based compensation ($27 million) and Trinidad revolving credit facility borrowings ($10 million). Cash used in financing activities for 2007 included repayments of long term borrowings ($158 million), cash dividend payments ($84 million), redemptions of preferred stock ($51 million), treasury stock purchases ($8 million) and debt issuance costs ($5 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, along with the total expenditures budgeted for 2009, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2009 2008 2007 2006 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 3,990 $ 2,976 $ 2,403 Leasehold Acquisitions 521 278 225 Producing Property Acquisitions 109 20 22 Capitalized Interest 43 29 20 Subtotal 4,663 3,303 2,670 Exploration Costs 194 150 155 Dry Hole Costs 55 115 80 Exploration and Development Expenditures 4,912 3,568 2,905 Approximately $2,850 Asset Retirement Costs 181 31 22 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 5,093 3,599 2,927 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 477 277 100 Approximately $250 Total Expenditures $ 5,570 $ 3,876 $ 3,027 35 Exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million for 2008 were $1,344 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $1,014 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,064 million), increased lease acquisitions in the United States ($143 million) and Canada ($96 million), increased producing property acquisitions in the United States ($66 million) and Canada ($12 million), increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($27 million) primarily attributable to the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale Play ($21 million), higher exploration employee related costs ($15 million) and increased capitalized interest in the United States ($11 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased dry hole costs in the United States ($40 million) and Trinidad ($20 million). The 2008 exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million includes $3,612 mil lion in development, $1,148 million in exploration, $109 million in producing property acquisitions and $43 million in capitalized interest. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2007 exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million includes $2,681 million in development, $838 million in exploration, $29 million in capitalized interest and $20 million in producing property acquisitions. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering systems and processing plants in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2006 exploration and development expenditures of $2,905 million includes $2,159 million in development, $704 million in exploration, $22 million in producing property acquisitions and $20 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom North Sea and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included realized losses of $137 million. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Financial Collar Contracts. The total fair value of EOGs natural gas financial collar contracts at December 31, 2008 was a positive $44 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas financial collar contracts at February 25, 2009. The notional volumes are expressed in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and prices are expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu). The average floor price of EOGs outstanding natural gas financial collar contracts for 2010 is $10.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and the average ceiling price is $12.32 per MMBtu.

The total fair value of EOGs natural gas financial price swap contracts at December 31, 2008 was a positive $805 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas financial price swap contracts at February 25, 2009. The notional volumes are expressed in MMBtud and prices are expressed in $/MMBtu. The average price of EOGs natural gas financial price swap contracts for 2009 is $9.71 per MMBtu and for 2010 is $9.87 per MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Price Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2009 January (closed) 585,000 $10.76 February (closed) 585,000 10.74 March (closed) 585,000 10.50 April 610,000 9.24 May 610,000 9.16 June 610,000 9.21 July 610,000 9.29 August 610,000 9.34 September 610,000 9.36 October 610,000 9.42 November 610,000 9.66 December 610,000 9.98 2010 January 20,000 $11.20 February 20,000 11.15 March 20,000 10.89 April 20,000 9.29 May 20,000 9.13 June 20,000 9.21 July 20,000 9.31 August 20,000 9.38 September 20,000 9.40 October 20,000 9.49 November 20,000 9.80 December 20,000 10.21 38 Financial Basis Swap Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its natural gas production generally vary from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into natural gas financial basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between prices in the Rocky Mountain area and NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The total fair value of EOGs natural gas financial basis swap contracts at December 31, 2008 was a negative $25 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas financial basis swap contracts at February 25, 2009. The weighted average price differential represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX gas prices per MMBtu for the notional volumes covered by the basis swap. The notional volumes are expressed in MMBtud and price differentials expressed in $/MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Basis Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price Differential (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2009 Second Quarter 65,000 $(2.54) Third Quarter 65,000 (2.60) Fourth Quarter 65,000 (3.03) 2010 First Quarter 65,000 $(1.72) Second Quarter 65,000 (2.56) Third Quarter 65,000 (3.17) Fourth Quarter 65,000 (3.73) 2011 First Quarter 65,000 $(1.89) Financing EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 17% at December 31, 2008 compared to 14% at December 31, 2007. During 2008, total debt increased $712 million to $1,897 million. The estimated fair value of EOGs debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,933 million and $1,227 million, respectively. The fair value of debt is the value EOG would have to pay to retire the debt, including any premium or discount to the debtholder for the differential between the stated interest rate and the year end market rate. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year end. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2008, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in an $115 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2008 and 2007, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the offering of its 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 described below, proceeds from the sale of EOGs Appalachian assets, cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper, other uncommitted credit facilities and a revolving credit facility to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $1.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2008 was $704 million, and the amount outstanding at year end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2008 was $130 million with no amounts outstanding at year end. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On September 30, 2008, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $743 million were used for general 39 corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. During September 2007, EOG issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017. Net proceeds of approximately $595 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. In December 2007, EOG repaid, at maturity, the remaining $98 million principal amount of its 6.50% Notes due in 2007. Also during 2007, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid the remaining $60 million year end 2006 outstanding balance of its $600 million, 3 year unsecured Senior Term Loan Agreement. EOG had previously terminated its remaining borrowing capacity under the Senior Term Loan Agreement. In 2007, EOG repurchased a total of 48,260 shares of its outstanding Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including premium and fees, of $51 million, plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase. EOG has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the $3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases. In January 2008, EOG repurchased the remaining 5,000 outstanding shares of its Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including a premium, of approximately $5.4 million. The premium of $0.4 million associated with the repurchase was included as a component of preferred stock dividends. As of December 31, 2008, no shares of Series B remain outstanding. See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 (in thousands): 2014 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Beyond Long Term Debt $ 1,897,000 $ 37,000 $ 220,000 $ 400,000 $ 1,240,000 Non Cancelable Operating Leases 290,725 70,125 72,311 44,388 103,901 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 947,659 115,999 231,295 200,495 399,870 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 1,984,199 213,516 435,780 417,998 916,905 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 246,853 179,984 66,869 Seismic Purchase Obligations 1,000 1,000 Other Purchase Obligations 81,373 60,652 20,721 Total Contractual Obligations $ 5,448,809 $ 678,276 $ 1,046,976 $ 1,062,881 $ 2,660,676 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2)Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2008. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOGs expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. 40 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2008, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2008 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2008 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2008, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $26 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids prices. However, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids comprised a larger portion of EOGs product mix in 2008 than in prior years and is expected to increase further in 2009. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply of and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. The market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in 2009 will impact the amount of cash generated from operat ing activities, which will in turn impact the level of EOGs 2009 total capital expenditures as well as its production. Including the impact of EOGs 2009 natural gas hedges, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2009 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $17 million for net income and $25 million for operating cash flow. EOGs price sensitivity in 2009 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $14 million for net income and $21 million for operating cash flow. For information regarding EOGs natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2008, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In 2009, EOG expects to allocate a slightly lower percentage of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area and the Rocky Mountain operating area than in 2008. EOG will also execute a steady drilling program to further develop the British Columbia Horn River Basin. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities. Budgeted 2009 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $2,850 million. In addition, budgeted 2009 expenditures for gathering and processing and other assets are approximately $250 million. The to tal 2009 capital expenditures budget of approximately $3.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOGs strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of total capital expenditures may vary in 2009 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, 41 EOG believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2009 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom North Sea and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2009 by 3% over 2008 levels based on average natural gas prices of $5.00 per Mcf at Henry Hub, West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices of $50.00 per barrel and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of $2,850 million, excluding acquisitions. United States production is expected to increase by 2%, with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 10% and 24%, respectively. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOGs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations, and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOGs control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOGs overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOGs operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. EOG is aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change issues. We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by certain of the Canadian provinces in which EOG operates. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect EOGs business, results of operations and financial condition. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and 42 economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a property by property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies." The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and or property dispositions and 4) impairments. 43 Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, EOG accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R), "Share Based Payment." In applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R), judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOGs common stock, the level of risk free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOGs stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOGs future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOGs management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOGs future operating results and returns or EOGs ability to re place or increase reserves, increase production or generate income or cash flows are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that these expectations will be achieved or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOGs forward looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOGs control. Important factors that could cause EOGs actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOGs forward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in prices for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; changes in demand for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities, including ammonia and methanol; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to discover, develop, market and produce reserves and to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties; the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling and advanced completion technologies; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale, the Bakken Formation, its Horn River Basin and Haynesville plays and its other exploration and development areas; EOGs ability to achieve anticipated production levels from existing and future natural gas and crude oil development projects, given the risks and uncertainties inherent in drilling, completing and operating natural gas and crude oil wells and the potential for interruptions of production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; EOGs ability to obtain access to surface locations for drilling and production facilities; the extent to which EOGs third party operated natural gas and crude oil properties are operated successfully and economically; EOGs ability to effectively integrate acquired natural gas and crude oil properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; weather, including its impact on natural gas and crude oil demand, and weather related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities; 44 the ability of EOGs customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOGs ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; changes in government policies, legislation and regulations, including environmental regulations; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and the other factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," on pages 13 through 19 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOGs subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements may not occur, and you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOGs forward looking statements. EOGs forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
