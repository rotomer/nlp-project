ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOGs str ategy. Net income available to common stockholders for 2009 totaled $547 million as compared to $2,436 million for 2008. At December 31, 2009, EOGs total estimated net proved reserves were 10.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 2,087 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2008. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2009. United States and Canada. EOGs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOGs natural gas and crude oil production. In Canada, EOG departed from its historical vertical shallow natural gas drilling program to focus on bigger target horizontal gas growth in the Horn River Basin and horizontal oil growth within existing legacy fields, mainly in Waskada, Manitoba and Highvale, Alberta. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 86% of total company production in 2009 as compared to 87% in 2008. In 2009, the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and North Dakota Bakken areas produced an increasing amou nt of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids. For 2009, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 22% of total company production as compared to 19% for 2008. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2010 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2009. EOGs major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. During the third quarter of 2009, EOG completed three transactions to acquire certain crude oil and natural gas properties and related assets located in Montague and Cooke Counties, Texas (Barnett Shale Combo Assets). The Barnett Shale Combo Assets consist of proved developed and undeveloped reserves and approximately 33,000 net unproved acres. Production from these assets averaged approximately 2,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net, at the time of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price of the transactions totaled $196.7 million, consisting of cash consideration of $107.1 million and 1,450,000 shares of EOG common stock valued at $89.6 million on the closing date of the applicable transaction. In October 2009, EOG entered into an agreement to acquire unproved acreage located in Nacogdoches County, Texas within the Haynesville and Bossier Shale formations (Haynesville Assets). EOG acquired 39,500 net unproved acres at the principal and supplemental closings held in October 2009 and December 2009, respectively. The acquisition agreement provides for an additional one time supplemental cash payment to the sellers of the Haynesville Assets that is contingent on the satisfaction of certain conditions (within a five year period beginning on the principal closing date) set forth in the acquisition agreement with respect to future natural gas prices. EOG estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition dates in accordance with the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and has included such amount in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of such contingent considera tion was $35.3 million at December 31, 2009. The aggregate consideration recorded in 2009 for the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets was $134 million, including the contingent consideration. Additionally, EOG expects to acquire up to an additional 7,500 net acres at a final closing expected to occur in the first quarter of 2010. The total price for the Haynesville Assets will not exceed $165 million. 26 In November 2009, EOG entered into an agreement to sell its crude oil and natural gas related assets located in California for cash consideration of $202 million, subject to customary adjustments under the agreement. The assets sold included approximately 80 wells that accounted for less than 1% of EOGs total 2009 production. The transaction closed on December 10, 2009. EOG realized a pretax gain of $146 million on the sale. In December 2009, EOG and a third party entered into an asset exchange agreement whereby the two parties exchanged certain natural gas related properties in the Rocky Mountain area. In accordance with provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the ASC, EOG realized a pretax gain of $390 million on the exchange to reflect the excess of the fair value of the properties received over the book basis of the properties given up in the transaction. In support of its operations in the North Dakota Bakken play, EOG constructed a crude oil loading facility near Stanley, North Dakota, designed to load crude oil into 100 car unit trains for transport to Stroud, Oklahoma. At Stroud, Oklahoma, EOG constructed a crude oil offloading facility and a pipeline to transport the crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub. The first shipment of crude oil through these facilities occurred at year end 2009. When fully operational, the capacity of these facilities is expected to allow transport of approximately 60,000 barrels per day of Bakken crude oil. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. In the Pelican Field, EOG drilled a successful exploratory well in late January 2010 that is expected to begin producing by the end of the first quarter of 2010. In the United Kingdom, EOG has ongoing production from the Valkyrie and Arthur fields in the Southern Gas Basin of the North Sea Block 23/16f. There is currently one producing well in the Arthur field, and such well is expected to cease production during the first half of 2010. The operator and partners of the non EOG operated Columbus discovery in the Central North Sea are continuing to evaluate export routes for future production. In addition, the operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change during the second quarter of 2010 and anticipates receiving approval in late 2010. During the third quarter of 2009, EOG completed a farm in agreement with the owners of the Central North Sea Block 15/30a Area AB. In December 2009, EOG began drilling an exploratory well on this prospect. The well was declared a dry hole in January 2010. EOG continues to expand its exploration prospect portfolio in the United Kingdom. During the second quarter of 2009, EOG drilled two exploratory wells in the East Irish Sea. Well 110/14b 7, in which EOG has a 70% working interest, was a dry hole while well 110/12 6, in which EOG has 100% working interest, was an oil discovery. Engineering studies were initiated with an intent to submit a field development plan to the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change during the first quarter of 2010. A rig has been contracted and has begun drilling two further exploratory wells offsetting the oil discovery. The first well was declared a dry hole in February 2010 and results for the second well are expected by the end of the first quarter of 2010. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to additional shallower zones on the acreage purchased. During the second quarter of 2009, EOG completed a monitoring well and in the third quarter of 2009, drilled a horizontal well. The horizontal well is being completed and will be tested during the first quarter of 2010. In addition, to evaluate one of the shallower zones, EOG drilled a second monitoring well during the third quarter of 2009 and is currently drilling a second horizontal well that it plans to complete during the third quarter of 2010. EOG continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified. 27 Capital Structure One of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOGs peer group. At December 31, 2009, EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 22%. During 2009, EOG funded $3.8 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement costs and non cash acquisition costs), paid $142 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $11 million of treasury stock, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds from long term debt borrowings, proceeds from the sale of its California assets and the issuance of 1.45 million shares of EOG common stock valued at $89.6 million. Management has not finalized or recommended to EOGs Board a 2010 capital expenditures budget. Management continues to evaluate various factors impacting future natural gas and crude oil prices, including the quantities of natural gas in storage and North American natural gas supplies. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects. All of these factors and uncertainties impact future capital requirements. EOG expects to finalize a 2010 capital expenditures budget early in the second quarter. While EOG currently anticipates an increase in its 2010 capital expenditures budget as compared to its 2009 budget, EOG intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and a below average debt to capitalization ratio as compared to its peer group. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. On May 21, 2009, EOG completed its public offering of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes). Interest on the 2019 Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $891 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. Net Operating Revenues During 2009, net operating revenues decreased $2,340 million, or 33%, to $4,787 million from $7,127 million in 2008. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOGs production of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids, decreased $2,823 million, or 45%, to $3,399 million from $6,222 million in 2008. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market commodity derivative contracts of $432 million compared to net gains of $598 million in 2008. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third party natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third party natural gas, increased $242 million, or 147%, to $407 million in 2009 from $165 million in 2008. Gains on property dispositions, net in 2009 primarily consist of a pretax gain of $390 million realized on an exchange of properties in the Rocky Mountain area and a pretax gain of $146 million realized on the sale of EOGs California assets. Gains on property dispositions, net in 2008 primarily consist of the gain of $128 million on the sale of Appalachian assets in February 2008. 28 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,134 1,162 971 Canada 224 222 224 Trinidad 273 218 252 Other International (2) 14 17 23 Total 1,645 1,619 1,470 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 3.72 $ 8.22 $ 6.27 Canada 3.85 7.64 6.25 Trinidad 1.73 3.58 2.71 Other International (2) 4.34 8.18 6.19 Composite 3.42 7.51 5.65 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 47.9 39.5 24.6 Canada 4.1 2.7 2.4 Trinidad 3.1 3.2 4.1 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 55.2 45.5 31.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 54.42 $ 87.68 $ 68.85 Canada 57.72 89.70 65.27 Trinidad 50.85 92.90 69.84 Other International (2) 53.07 99.30 66.84 Composite 54.46 88.18 68.69 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 22.5 15.0 11.1 Canada 1.1 1.0 1.1 Total 23.6 16.0 12.2 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 30.03 $ 53.33 $ 47.63 Canada 30.49 54.77 44.54 Composite 30.05 53.42 47.36 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (4) United States 1,556 1,490 1,184 Canada 256 244 245 Trinidad 291 237 276 Other International (2) 15 17 24 Total 2,118 1,988 1,729 Total Bcfe (4) 773.0 727.6 631.3 (1)Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable.

(4)Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids. Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids. 29 2009 compared to 2008. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2009 decreased $2,401 million, or 54%, to $2,051 million from $4,452 million for 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($2,460 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($59 million). EOGs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 54% to $3.42 per Mcf in 2009 from $7.51 per Mcf in 2008. Natural gas deliveries increased 26 MMcfd, or 2%, to 1,645 MMcfd in 2009 from 1,619 MMcfd in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher production of 55 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 28 MMcfd in the United States and 6 MMcfd in the United Kingdom. The increase in Trinidad was primarily due to a reduction in plant shutdowns for maintenance during 2009 (39 MMcfd) and increased net contractual deliveries (16 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production from Texas (26 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Mississippi (4 MMcfd), Kansas (3 MMcfd) and Oklahoma (3 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (6 MMcfd) and in the Rocky Mountain area (8 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues decreased $368 million, or 25%, to $1,090 million in 2009 from $1,458 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($675 million), partially offset by an increase of 10 MBbld, or 21%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($307 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (8 MBbld) and Texas (2 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2009 decreased 38% to $54.46 per barrel compared to $88.18 per barrel for 2008. Natural gas liquids revenues decreased $53 million, or 17%, to $259 million in 2009 from $312 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average price ($201 million), partially offset by an increase of 8 MBbld, or 48%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($148 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2009 decreased 44% to $30.05 per barrel compared to $53.42 per barrel for 2008. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third party natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third party natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2009, substantially all of such revenues were related to sales of third party natural gas and crude oil. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, such revenues were primarily related to sales of third party natural gas. Sales of third party natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third party natural gas and crude oil and the associated transportation costs. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs decreased $2 million to $10 million in 2009 compared to $12 million in 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. 2008 compared to 2007. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2008 increased $1,419 million, or 47%, to $4,452 million from $3,033 million for 2007 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($1,101 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($318 million). EOGs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 33% to $7.51 per Mcf in 2008 from $5.65 per Mcf in 2007. Natural gas deliveries increased 149 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,619 MMcfd in 2008 from 1,470 MMcfd in 2007. The increase was due to higher production of 191 MMcfd in the United States and initial production of 5 MMcfd in China, partially offset by lower production of 34 MMcfd in Trinidad, 11 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (140 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (54 MMcfd), Mississippi (8 MMcfd) and Kansas (4 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production due to the February 2008 sale of Appalachian assets (15 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was primarily due to decreased deliveries as a result of plant shutdowns due to unplanned maintenance activities (29 MMcfd) and reduced deliveries due to lower demand in 2008 (10 MMcfd), partially offset by increased deliveries to Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) (5 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of product ion declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. 30 Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $680 million, or 87%, to $1,458 million in 2008 from $778 million in 2007, due to an increase of 14.3 MBbld, or 46%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($358 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($322 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (12 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2008 increased 28% to $88.18 per barrel compared to $68.69 per barrel for 2007. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $102 million, or 49%, to $312 million in 2008 from $210 million in 2007, due to increases in deliveries ($67 million) and a higher composite average price ($35 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2008 increased 13% to $53.42 per barrel compared to $47.36 per barrel for 2007. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included net realized gains of $128 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs increased $5 million to $12 million in 2008 compared to $7 million in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. Operating and Other Expenses 2009 compared to 2008. During 2009, operating expenses of $3,816 million were $456 million higher than the $3,360 million incurred in 2008. The following table presents the costs per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 Lease and Well $ 0.75 $ 0.77 Transportation Costs 0.37 0.38 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) Oil and Gas Properties 1.89 1.74 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.12 0.09 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.32 0.34 Net Interest Expense 0.13 0.07 Total (1) $ 3.58 $ 3.39 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2009 compared to 2008 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOGs natural gas and crude oil wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. 31 Lease and well expenses of $579 million in 2009 increased $20 million from $559 million in 2008 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in Canada ($16 million) and the United States ($14 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($8 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($5 million). Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs, transportation fees and third party costs associated with transporting crude oil. Transportation costs of $283 million in 2009 increased $9 million from $274 million in 2008 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($19 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million). DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. EOGs DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consist of gathering and processing assets, compressors, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2009 increased $222 million to $1,549 million from $1,327 million in 2008. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $192 million higher than in 2008 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($42 million), Canada ($9 million) and Trinidad ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($105 million), Canada ($22 million) and Trinidad ($13 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($13 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $30 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($16 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($9 million). G&A expenses of $248 million in 2009 were $5 million higher than 2008 due primarily to higher insurance costs ($3 million) and higher employee related costs ($2 million). Net interest expense of $101 million in 2009 increased $49 million from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($61 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($12 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOGs gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $17 million to $58 million in 2009 compared to $41 million in 2008. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million). Exploration costs of $170 million in 2009 decreased $24 million from $194 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. 32 Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Impairments of $306 million in 2009 increased $113 million from $193 million in 2008 primarily due to increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($103 million) and increased impairments of proved properties in the United States ($32 million), partially offset by 2008 impairments in Trinidad as a result of EOGs relinquishment of its rights to Block Lower Reverse "L" (LRL) ($20 million) and in the United Kingdom for the Arthur field ($6 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties of $94 million and $86 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2009 decreased $147 million to $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) from $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2008. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues in the United States ($103 million), Trinidad ($13 million) and Canada ($3 million); an increase in credits taken in 2009 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($16 million); and lower ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($15 million). Other income, net was $2 million in 2009 compared to $31 million in 2008. The decrease of $29 million was primarily due to lower equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($15 million), lower interest income ($8 million) and settlements received in 2008 related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($3 million). Income tax provision of $325 million in 2009 decreased $984 million compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2009 increased to 37% from 35% in 2008. The increase in the 2009 net effective tax rate is primarily as a result of higher state tax rates and the absence of 2008 tax benefits related to the impairment of LRL. 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, operating expenses of $3,360 million were $769 million higher than the $2,591 million incurred in 2007. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 Lease and Well $ 0.77 $ 0.72 Transportation Costs 0.38 0.24 DD&A Oil and Gas Properties 1.74 1.63 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.09 0.06 G&A 0.34 0.33 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.07 Total (1) $ 3.39 $ 3.05 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2008 compared to 2007 are set forth below. 33 Lease and well expenses of $559 million in 2008 increased $107 million from $452 million in 2007 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses ($78 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($28 million), both in the United States. Transportation costs of $274 million in 2008 increased $122 million from $152 million in 2007 primarily due to increased production and costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($64 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($38 million) to downstream markets. DD&A expenses in 2008 increased $261 million to $1,327 million from $1,066 million in 2007. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $236 million higher than in 2007 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($210 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($10 million) and in Trinidad ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($15 million) and Canada ($8 million). Changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($11 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $25 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. G&A expenses of $244 million in 2008 were $38 million higher than 2007 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($33 million). The increase in employee related costs primarily reflects higher stock based compensation expenses ($18 million). Net interest expense of $52 million in 2008 increased $5 million from $47 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($18 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($13 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $13 million to $41 million in 2008 as compared to $28 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. Exploration costs of $194 million in 2008 increased $44 million from $150 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($27 million) and higher employee related costs ($15 million). The increase in geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States was primarily attributable to activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($21 million). Impairments of $193 million in 2008 were $45 million higher than impairments of $148 million in 2007 due primarily to increased amortization costs as a result of increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($30 million) and Canada ($12 million), an impairment in Trinidad recorded in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of EOGs relinquishment of its rights to LRL ($20 million) and an impairment in the United Kingdom for the Arthur field ($6 million), partially offset by decreased impairments in Canada ($20 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties of $86 million and $82 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Taxes other than income in 2008 increased $113 million to $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2007 primarily due to an increase in severance/production taxes in the United States as a result of increased wellhead revenues ($86 million), a decrease in credits taken in 2008 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($13 million) and increased ad valorem/property taxes as a result of higher property valuations in the United States ($20 million). Income tax provision of $1,310 million in 2008 increased $769 million compared to 2007 due primarily to increased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2008 increased to 35% from 33% in 2007. The increase in the 2008 net effective tax rate is primarily due to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction in 2007. 34 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2009 were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; repayments of debt; and redemptions of preferred stock. 2009 compared to 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,922 million in 2009 decreased $1,711 million from $4,633 million in 2008 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($2,823 million); unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($335 million); an increase in cash operating expenses ($125 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($53 million); partially offset by a favorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,414 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($243 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($43 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,415 million in 2009 decreased by $1,552 million from $4,967 million for the same period of 2008 due primarily to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,542 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($150 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($34 million); partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($172 million). Proceeds from sales of assets included net proceeds from the sale of EOGs California assets in December 2009 ($200 million) and net proceeds from the sale of EOGs Appalachian assets in February 2008 ($386 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $834 million in 2009 included the issuance of long term debt ($900 million), excess tax benefits from stock based compensation ($76 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($20 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2009 included cash dividend payments ($142 million), treasury stock purchases ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($9 million). 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,633 million in 2008 increased $1,732 million from $2,901 million in 2007 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,202 million); favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($170 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($91 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($50 million); partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($404 million); an increase in marketing costs ($86 million); an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($265 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($9 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,967 million in 2008 increased by $1,511 million from $3,456 million for the same period of 2007 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,317 million), unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($296 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($199 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($300 million), primarily reflecting net proceeds from the sale of EOGs Appalachian assets. Net cash provided by financing activities of $645 million in 2008 included the issuance of long term debt ($750 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($73 million) and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation ($6 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2008 included cash dividend payments ($115 million), Trinidad revolving credit facility repayment ($38 million), treasury stock purchases ($18 million), debt issuance costs ($8 million) and the redemption of preferred stock ($5 million). 35 Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions): Actual 2009 2008 2007 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 2,417 $ 3,990 $ 2,976 Leasehold Acquisitions 424 521 278 Property Acquisitions (1) 707 109 20 Capitalized Interest 55 43 29 Subtotal 3,603 4,663 3,303 Exploration Costs 170 194 150 Dry Hole Costs 51 55 115 Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,824 4,912 3,568 Asset Retirement Costs 84 181 31 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,908 5,093 3,599 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 326 477 277 Total Expenditures $ 4,234 $ 5,570 $ 3,876 (1) In 2009, property acquisitions includes non cash additions of $353 million related to a property exchange transaction in the Rocky Mountain area and contingent consideration, with a fair value of $35 million, related to the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets. Exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million for 2009 were $1,088 million lower than the prior year due primarily to decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,529 million), Canada ($44 million) and Trinidad ($41 million); decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in Canada ($122 million); decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($23 million); changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in Canada ($16 million); decreased property acquisition expenditures in Trinidad ($15 million), Canada ($14 million) and China ($10 million); and decreased dry hole costs in Canada ($11 million) and the United States ($4 million). These decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisition expenditures in the United States ($638 million), increased drilling and facilities expenditures in China ($41 million) and the United Kingdom ($10 million), increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($2 9 million), increased capitalized interest in the United States ($15 million) and increased dry hole costs in the United Kingdom ($12 million). The 2009 exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million include $2,082 million in development, $980 million in exploration, $707 million in property acquisitions and $55 million in capitalized interest. The decrease in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. The 2008 exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million include $3,612 million in development, $1,148 million in exploration, $109 million in property acquisitions and $43 million in capitalized interest. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2007 exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million include $2,681 million in development, $838 million in exploration, $29 million in capitalized interest and $20 million in property acquisitions. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 36 Derivative Transactions During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Collar Contracts. The total fair value of EOGs natural gas financial collar contracts at December 31, 2009 was a positive $34 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas financial collar contracts at February 25, 2010. The notional volumes are expressed in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and prices are expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu). The average floor price of EOGs outstanding natural gas financial collar contracts for 2010 is $9.34 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and the average ceiling price is $11.54 per MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Collar Contracts Floor Price Ceiling Price Weighted Ceiling Weighted Volume Floor Range Average Price Range Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) 2010 January (closed) 40,000 $11.44 11.47 $11.45 $13.79 13.90 $13.85 February (closed) 40,000 11.38 11.41 11.40 13.75 13.85 13.80 March (closed) 40,000 11.13 11.15 11.14 13.50 13.60 13.55 April 40,000 9.40 9.45 9.42 11.55 11.65 11.60 May 40,000 9.24 9.29 9.26 11.41 11.55 11.48 June 40,000 9.31 9.36 9.34 11.49 11.60 11.55 On April 29, 2009, EOG settled its natural gas financial collar contracts with notional volumes of 40,000 MMBtud for the July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 period and received proceeds of $26.5 million. Financial Price Swap Contracts. The total fair value of EOGs natural gas financial price swap contracts at December 31, 2009 was a positive $16 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas financial price swap contracts at February 25, 2010. The average price of EOGs natural gas financial price swap contracts for 2010 is $9.21 per MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Price Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2010 January (closed) 20,000 $11.20 February (closed) 20,000 11.15 March (closed) 20,000 10.89 April 20,000 9.29 May 20,000 9.13 June 20,000 9.21 On April 24, 2009, EOG settled its natural gas financial price swap contracts with notional volumes of 20,000 MMBtud for the July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 period and received proceeds of $12.1 million. 37 Financial Basis Swap Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its natural gas production generally vary from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into natural gas financial basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between prices in the Rocky Mountain area and NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The total fair value of EOGs natural gas financial basis swap contracts at December 31, 2009 was a negative $66 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas financial basis swap contracts at February 25, 2010. The weighted average price differential represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX gas prices per MMBtu for the notional volumes covered by the basis swap. Natural Gas Financial Basis Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price Differential (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2010 First Quarter (1) 65,000 $(1.72) Second Quarter 65,000 (2.56) Third Quarter 65,000 (3.17) Fourth Quarter 65,000 (3.73) 2011 First Quarter 65,000 $(1.89) (1)Includes closed contracts for the month of January and February 2010. Financing EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 22% at December 31, 2009 compared to 17% at December 31, 2008. During 2009, total debt increased $900 million to $2,797 million. The estimated fair value of EOGs debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3,056 million and $1,933 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year end. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2009, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $187 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2009, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the offering of its 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 described below, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $1.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2009 was $675 million, and the amount outstanding at year end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2009 was $17 million with no amounts outstanding at year end. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On May 21, 2009, EOG completed its public offering of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes). Interest on the 2019 Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $891 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 38 On September 30, 2008, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $743 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): 2015 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Beyond Long Term Debt $ 2,797,000 $ 37,000 $ 220,000 $ 550,000 $ 1,990,000 Non Cancelable Operating Leases 305,068 92,105 64,221 48,479 100,263 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 1,313,300 166,693 317,145 273,683 555,779 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 2,583,090 247,460 610,542 603,375 1,121,713 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 181,615 158,302 23,313 Seismic Purchase Obligations 9,667 9,667 Other Purchase Obligations 79,541 74,851 4,090 600 Total Contractual Obligations $ 7,269,281 $ 786,078 $ 1,239,311 $ 1,476,137 $ 3,767,755 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2)Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2009. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOGs expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. 39 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2009, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2009 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2009 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2009, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $49 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The change is included in Accu mulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids prices. However, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production comprised a larger portion of EOGs production mix in 2009 than in prior years and is expected to comprise an even larger portion in 2010. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply of and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as crude oil and coal. The market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in 2010 will impact the am ount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact the level of EOGs 2010 total capital expenditures as well as its production. Including the impact of EOGs 2010 natural gas hedges, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2010 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for cash flows from operating activities. EOGs price sensitivity in 2010 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOGs natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2009, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities. Management has not finalized or recommended to EOGs Board a 2010 capital expenditures budget. Management continues to evaluate various factors impacting future natural gas and crude oil prices, including the quantities of natural gas in storage and North American natural gas supplies. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects. All of these factors and uncertainties impact future capital requirements. EOG expects to finalize a 2010 capital expenditures budget early in the second quarter. While EOG currently anticipates an increase in its 2010 capital expenditures budget as compared to its 2009 budget, EOG intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and a below average debt to capitalization ratio as compared to its peer group. 40 Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2010 by 13% over 2009 levels. Total United States production is expected to increase by 15%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 53% and 31%, respectively. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOGs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations. These laws and regulations could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOGs control, and under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. EOG also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal o r to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Moreover, EOG is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOGs overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOGs operations, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations, but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on EOGs operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. EOG is aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPAs rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, EOG is also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by certain of the Canadian provinces in which EOG operates. EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any such proposed laws, regulations and treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOGs business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. EOG believes that its strategy to reduce GHG emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice. EOG will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters, including climate change. In addition, EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. 41 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic c onditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. 42 Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and or property dispositions and 4) impairments. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Stock Based Compensation In accounting for stock based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOGs common stock, the level of risk free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOGs stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOGs future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOGs management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOGs future operating results and returns or EOGs ability to repl ace or increase reserves, increase production or generate income or cash flows are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOGs forward looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOGs control. Important factors that could cause EOGs actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOGs forward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in prices for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; changes in demand for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities, including ammonia and methanol; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to discover and market reserves and to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties; the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling and advanced completion technologies; 43 the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, and to produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future natural gas and crude oil exploration and development projects, given the risks and uncertainties inherent in drilling, completing and operating natural gas and crude oil wells and the potential for interruptions of production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; changes in government policies, laws and regulations, including environmental and tax laws and regulations; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; EOGs ability to obtain access to surface locations for drilling and production facilities; the extent to which EOGs third party operated natural gas and crude oil properties are operated successfully and economically; EOGs ability to effectively integrate acquired natural gas and crude oil properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; weather, including its impact on natural gas and crude oil demand, and weather related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of production, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the ability of EOGs customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOGs ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and the other factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," on pages 14 through 19 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOGs subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOGs forward looking statements. EOGs forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.
