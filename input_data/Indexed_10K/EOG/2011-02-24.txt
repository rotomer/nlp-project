ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by empha sizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOGs strategy. Net income available to common stockholders for 2010 totaled $161 million as compared to $547 million for 2009. At December 31, 2010, EOGs total estimated net proved reserves were 1,950 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 154 MMBoe from December 31, 2009. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2010. United States and Canada. EOGs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOGs crude oil and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling expertise gained in natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil reservoirs. In 2010, EOG focused its efforts on developing its existing North American crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids acreage and capturing additional North America n horizontal crude oil plays. During 2010, the North Dakota Bakken and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale areas produced an increased amount of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to 2009. EOG holds approximately 520,000 net acres in the mature oil window of the Eagle Ford Shale Play near San Antonio, Texas, where it drilled 96 net wells and completed 80 net wells in 2010. EOG averaged 15.1 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in this play in December 2010 and expects crude oil production from this play to continue to grow in 2011. In Canada, EOG departed from its historical vertical shallow natural gas drilling program to focus on bigger target horizontal natural gas growth in the Horn River Basin and horizontal crude oil growth within existing legacy fields, mainly in Waskada, Manitoba and Highvale, Alberta. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential explorati on and development prospects. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 83% of total company production in 2010 as compared to 86% in 2009. For 2010, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 27% of total company production as compared to 22% for 2009. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2011 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2010. EOGs major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. During the second quarter of 2010, EOGs wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, EOG Resources Canada Inc. (EOGRC), agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Galveston LNG Inc., a Calgary based corporation which, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Kitimat LNG Inc. and affiliates, owns 49 percent of the planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal to be located at Bish Cove, near the Port of Kitimat, about 405 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia. Planned capacity of the proposed Kitimat LNG terminal is about 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day or five million metric tons of LNG per year. Preliminary total construction costs, currently estimated to be approximately $3 billion (Canadian), will be revised at the conclusion of front end engineering and design. In addition, Galveston LNG Inc. also owns a 24.5 percent interest in the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines (PTP), a total estimated $1 billion (Canadian), 300 mile project, originating at Summit Lake, British Columbia. The pipeline is intended to link Western Canadas natural gas producing regions to the Kitimat LNG terminal. An affiliate of Apache Corporation owns 51 percent of the planned Kitimat LNG terminal and a 25.5 percent interest in PTP and will be the operator of the Kitimat LNG terminal. During the fourth quarter of 2010, upon the achievement of certain commercial and regulatory milestones, EOGRC paid $210 million to complete the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. In connection with the acquisition, EOG recorded intangible assets related to 29 certain leases, permits and other contracts. Such intangible assets are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the first quarter of 2011, EOGRC entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 24.5 percent interest in PTP for $24.5 million (subject to customary closing conditions). A portion of the purchase price ($14.7 million) will be paid at closing with the remaining amount ($9.8 million) to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the Kitimat LNG terminal. Subsequent to closing, EOGRCs ownership interest will be 49 percent. An affiliate of Apache Corporation entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 25.5 percent interest in PTP, which will increase its ownership interest to 51 percent of the proposed proj ect. As previously reported, EOG began marketing its Canadian shallow natural gas assets in July 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, EOG closed on transactions with three separate parties to sell these assets for approximately $344 million, including an estimate of customary adjustments under each respective sales agreement. EOG recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to adjust the shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell. These assets represented approximately 4% of EOGs total 2009 production and approximately 3% of EOGs total year end 2009 proved reserves. In addition, EOG received proceeds of approximately $329 million from the sale in 2010 of non core producing properties and acreage, primarily in the Rocky Mountain area, Texas and Pennsylvania. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block and Modified U(b) Block, as well as the Pelican Field, have been developed and are producing. In the Pelican Field, EOG drilled a successful exploratory well that began producing in the first quarter of 2010. In Block 4(a), EOG completed installation of offshore facilities and began its development drilling program in December 2010 to supply natural gas under a contract with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) into the North Eastern Offshore (NEO) pipeline being installed by NGC. E OG is sourcing the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the NEO pipeline is completed. Sales under the contract commenced on January 1, 2010. In the United Kingdom (U.K.), EOG has ongoing production from the Valkyrie field in the Southern Gas Basin of the North Sea Block 49/16f. The last well in the Arthur field ceased production in 2010. In 2006, EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited (EOGUK) participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f. EOG has a 25% non operating interest in this block. A successful Columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007. The field operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan by the end of 2011. The operator and partners are currently negotiating processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners. In 2009, EOGUK drilled a successful exploratory well in its East Irish Sea blocks. Well 110/12 6, in which EOGUK has a 100% working interest, was an oil discovery and was designated the Conwy field. In 2010, EOGUK added an adjoining field in its East Irish Sea block, designated Corfe, to its overall development plans. During 2010, feasibility and front end engineering design studies were completed, and all principal contracts are currently being negotiated for the development plan. A field development plan for the Conwy field was submitted to the DECC in the first quarter of 2011 and a separate plan is expected to be submitted for the Corfe field before the end of the first quarter of 2011. Regulatory approval of both plans is expect ed by the end of 2011. Installation of pipelines, drilling of development wells and initial production are planned for 2012. Two additional exploratory wells offsetting the Conwy field were drilled in the first quarter of 2010. Both wells were unsuccessful. The licenses for the East Irish Sea blocks were awarded to EOGUK in 2007. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired. During 2010, EOG drilled four horizontal wells, one of which was completed in 2010 and another which was completed in January 2011. In addition, EOG completed a horizontal well that was originally drilled in 2009. The wells completed in 2010 began production in the first and second quarters of 2010. EOG plans to complete two wells during the second quarter of 2011. EOG expects to complete its evaluation of the economic viability of this project during the first half of 2 011. EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 30 Capital Structure One of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOGs peer group. EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 34% and 22% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long term debt and total stockholders equity. During 2010, EOG funded $6.0 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement costs and non cash acquisition costs), paid $153 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $11 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds from long term debt borrowings described below and proceeds of $673 million from the sale of certain North American assets. On November 23, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (2016 Notes), $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) (together, the Fixed Rate Notes) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the Floating Rate Notes). Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2011. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 3, May 3, August 3 and November 3 of each year, beginning on February 3, 2011 and is based on the three month London InterBank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.75% per annum. T he interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes resets quarterly on the interest payment dates. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1,487 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Contemporaneously with the offering of the Floating Rate Notes, EOG entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes at 1.87%. On September 10, 2010, EOG entered into a second $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders (2010 Agreement). The 2010 Agreement matures on September 10, 2013 (subject to EOGs option to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one year periods). See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 20, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% Senior Notes due 2015 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 (together, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2010. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $990 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The total anticipated 2011 capital expenditures are $6.4 to $6.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2011 expenditures will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil drilling activity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays to hold acreage. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2011. EOGs business plan includes selling certain non core natural gas assets in 2011 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, b ank borrowings, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and equity and debt offerings. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. 31 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. Net Operating Revenues During 2010, net operating revenues increased $1,313 million, or 27%, to $6,100 million from $4,787 million in 2009. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOGs production of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas, in 2010 increased $1,482 million, or 44%, to $4,881 million from $3,399 million in 2009. During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million compared to net gains of $432 million in 2009. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third party natural gas, in 2010 increased $503 million, or 123%, to $910 million from $407 million in 2009. Gains on property dispositions, net, of $224 million in 2010 primarily consist of gains on property dispositions in the Rocky Mountain area. Gains on property dispositions, net, in 2009 primarily consist of a pretax gain of $390 million realized on an exchange of properties in the Rocky Mountain area and a pretax gain of $146 million realized on the sale of EOGs California assets. 32 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 63.2 47.9 39.5 Canada 6.7 4.1 2.7 Trinidad 4.7 3.1 3.2 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 74.7 55.2 45.5 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 74.88 $ 54.42 $ 87.68 Canada 72.66 57.72 89.70 Trinidad 68.80 50.85 92.90 Other International (2) 73.11 53.07 99.30 Composite 74.29 54.46 88.18 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 29.5 22.5 15.0 Canada 0.9 1.1 1.0 Total 30.4 23.6 16.0 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 41.68 $ 30.03 $ 53.33 Canada 43.40 30.49 54.77 Composite 41.73 30.05 53.42 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,133 1,134 1,162 Canada 200 224 222 Trinidad 341 273 218 Other International (2) 14 14 17 Total 1,688 1,645 1,619 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 4.30 $ 3.72 $ 8.22 Canada 3.91 3.85 7.64 Trinidad 2.65 1.73 3.58 Other International (2) 4.90 4.34 8.18 Composite 3.93 3.42 7.51 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 281.5 259.4 248.4 Canada 40.9 42.6 40.6 Trinidad 61.5 48.5 39.5 Other International (2) 2.5 2.4 2.8 Total 386.4 352.9 331.3 Total MMBoe (4) 141.1 128.8 121.3 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.

Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (4) Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 33 2010 compared to 2009. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2010 increased $909 million, or 83%, to $1,999 million from $1,090 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($533 million) and an increase of 20 MBbld, or 35%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($376 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in Texas (8 MBbld), North Dakota (7 MBbld), Canada (3 MBbld) and Trinidad (2 MBbld). Production increases in Texas were the result of increased production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Combo and the Eagle Ford plays. Production increases in North Dakota resulted from increased deliv eries from the Bakken and Three Forks plays. EOGs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2010 increased 36% to $74.29 per barrel compared to $54.46 per barrel in 2009. Natural gas liquids revenues in 2010 increased $203 million, or 79%, to $462 million from $259 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average price ($129 million) and an increase of 7 MBbld, or 29%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($74 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. EOGs composite average natural gas liquids price in 2010 increased 39% to $41.73 per barrel compared to $30.05 per barrel in 2009. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2010 increased $369 million, or 18%, to $2,420 million from $2,051 million in 2009. The increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($316 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($53 million). EOGs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 15% to $3.93 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2010 from $3.42 per Mcf in 2009. Natural gas deliveries in 2010 increased 43 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd), or 3%, to 1,688 MMcfd from 1,645 MMcfd in 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher production in Trinidad (68 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in Canada (24 MMcfd) and the United States (1 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was primarily attributable to deliveries under a take or pay contract, which began January 1, 2010. The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production in the Rocky Mountain area (28 MMcfd), offshore Gulf of Mexico (9 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Texas (5 MMcfd), Kansas (5 MMcfd) and Mississippi (4 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (45 MMcfd) and Pennsylvania (11 MMcfd). During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third party natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third party crude oil and natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2008, gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third party natural gas. The purchase and sale of third party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs. During 2010, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2010 totaled $25 million compared to $10 million in 2009, primarily as a result of higher crude oil marketing margins. 2009 compared to 2008. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues decreased $368 million, or 25%, to $1,090 million in 2009 from $1,458 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($675 million), partially offset by an increase of 10 MBbld, or 21%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($307 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (8 MBbld) and Texas (2 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2009 decreased 38% to $54.46 per barrel compared to $88.18 per barrel for 2008. 34 Natural gas liquids revenues decreased $53 million, or 17%, to $259 million in 2009 from $312 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average price ($201 million), partially offset by an increase of 8 MBbld, or 48%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($148 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2009 decreased 44% to $30.05 per barrel compared to $53.42 per barrel for 2008. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2009 decreased $2,401 million, or 54%, to $2,051 million from $4,452 million for 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($2,460 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($59 million). EOGs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 54% to $3.42 per Mcf in 2009 from $7.51 per Mcf in 2008. Natural gas deliveries increased 26 MMcfd, or 2%, to 1,645 MMcfd in 2009 from 1,619 MMcfd in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher production of 55 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 28 MMcfd in the United States and 6 MMcfd in the United Kingdom. The increase in Trinidad was primarily due to a reduction in plant shutdowns for maintenance during 2009 (39 MMcfd) and increased net contractual deliveries (16 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production from Texas (26 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Mississippi (4 MMcfd), Kansas (3 MMcfd) and Oklahoma (3 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (6 MMcfd) and in the Rocky Mountain area (8 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs decreased $2 million to $10 million in 2009 compared to $12 million in 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. Operating and Other Expenses 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, operating expenses of $5,577 million were $1,761 million higher than the $3,816 million incurred in 2009. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Lease and Well $ 4.96 $ 4.50 Transportation Costs 2.74 2.20 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) Oil and Gas Properties (1) 13.19 11.29 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.79 0.74 General and Administrative (G&A) 1.99 1.93 Net Interest Expense 0.92 0.78 Total (2) $ 24.59 $ 21.44 (1) The 2010 amount excludes the reductions in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $24 million, or $0.17 per Boe relating to the acquisition of certain unproved acreage (see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2010 compared to 2009 are set forth below. 35 Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOGs crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. In general, operating costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating costs for wells producing natural gas. Lease and well expenses of $698 million in 2010 increased $119 million from $579 million in 2009 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($67 million) and Canada ($6 million), increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($27 million), primarily due to higher costs associated with increased crude oil activities, unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($14 million) and increased workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Canada ($2 million). Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs, transportation fees and costs associated with EOGs crude by rail operations. Transportation costs of $385 million in 2010 increased $102 million from $283 million in 2009 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($46 million), the Upper Gulf Coast area ($29 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($29 million). These increases reflect costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production to downstream markets. The increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area also include costs associated with EOGs crude by rail operations, which began transporting crude oil from Stanley, North Dakota, to Cushing, Oklahoma, at the end of December 2009. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. EOGs DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. &#16 0;Other property, plant and equipment consist of gathering and processing assets, compressors, crude by rail assets, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2010 increased $393 million to $1,942 million from $1,549 million in 2009. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2010 were $378 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($97 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($2 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($8 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($167 million), Canada ($86 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($8 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($28 million), partially offset by a change in the fair value of th e contingent consideration liability ($24 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $15 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants being placed in service in the Rocky Mountain area ($10 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($4 million). G&A expenses of $280 million in 2010 were $32 million higher than 2009 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($10 million), higher legal and other professional fees ($7 million) and higher information systems costs ($3 million). 36 Net interest expense of $130 million in 2010 increased $29 million from $101 million in 2009 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($50 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($21 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOGs gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $9 million to $67 million in 2010 compared to $58 million in 2009. The increase reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($6 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($3 million). Exploration costs of $187 million in 2010 increased $17 million from $170 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased employee related costs in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower t han the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. For certain natural gas assets held for sale, EOG utilized accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Impairments of $743 million in 2010 increased $437 million from $306 million in 2009 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment in Canada. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment of $526 million and $94 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, EOG recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to adjust certain Canadian shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell (see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, EOG recorded pretax impairments of $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to certain North American onshore and offshore natural gas assets. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2010 increased $143 million to $317 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) in 2009. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($56 million), Trinidad ($22 million) and Canada ($6 million); a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2010 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit ($43 million); and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($14 million). Other income, net was $14 million in 2010 compared to $2 million in 2009. The increase of $12 million was primarily due to higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($9 million). Income tax provision of $247 million in 2010 decreased $78 million compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2010 increased to 61% from 37% in 2009. The increase in the 2010 net effective tax rate is primarily due to higher state income taxes and to the tax effects of increased earnings in Trinidad and Canadian book losses, which resulted largely from the impairment of certain Canadian shallow natural gas impairments. The statutory tax rates in the United States and Trinidad are higher than the Canadian statutory rate. 37 2009 compared to 2008. During 2009, operating expenses of $3,816 million were $456 million higher than the $3,360 million incurred in 2008. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 Lease and Well $ 4.50 $ 4.62 Transportation Costs 2.20 2.26 DD&A Oil and Gas Properties 11.29 10.41 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.74 0.54 G&A 1.93 2.01 Net Interest Expense 0.78 0.43 Total (1) $ 21.44 $ 20.27 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2009 compared to 2008 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $579 million in 2009 increased $20 million from $559 million in 2008 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in Canada ($16 million) and the United States ($14 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($8 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($5 million). Transportation costs of $283 million in 2009 increased $9 million from $274 million in 2008 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($19 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million). DD&A expenses in 2009 increased $222 million to $1,549 million from $1,327 million in 2008. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $192 million higher than in 2008 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($42 million), Canada ($9 million) and Trinidad ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($105 million), Canada ($22 million) and Trinidad ($13 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($13 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $30 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($16 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($9 million). G&A expenses of $248 million in 2009 were $5 million higher than 2008 due primarily to higher insurance costs ($3 million) and higher employee related costs ($2 million). Net interest expense of $101 million in 2009 increased $49 million from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($61 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($12 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $17 million to $58 million in 2009 compared to $41 million in 2008. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million). Exploration costs of $170 million in 2009 decreased $24 million from $194 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. 38 Impairments of $306 million in 2009 increased $113 million from $193 million in 2008 primarily due to increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($103 million) and increased impairments of proved properties in the United States ($32 million), partially offset by 2008 impairments in Trinidad as a result of EOGs relinquishment of its rights to Block Lower Reverse "L" (LRL) ($20 million) and in the U.K. for the Arthur field ($6 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties of $94 million and $86 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Taxes other than income in 2009 decreased $147 million to $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) from $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2008. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues in the United States ($103 million), Trinidad ($13 million) and Canada ($3 million); an increase in credits taken in 2009 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($16 million); and lower ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($15 million). Other income, net was $2 million in 2009 compared to $31 million in 2008. The decrease of $29 million was primarily due to lower equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($15 million), lower interest income ($8 million) and settlements received in 2008 related to a bankruptcy ($3 million). Income tax provision of $325 million in 2009 decreased $984 million compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2009 increased to 37% from 35% in 2008. The increase in the 2009 net effective tax rate is primarily as a result of higher state tax rates and the absence of 2008 tax benefits related to the impairment of LRL. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2010 were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long term debt, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; and repayments of debt. 2010 compared to 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,709 million in 2010 decreased $213 million from $2,922 million in 2009 primarily reflecting an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,271 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($410 million), an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($182 million), an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($46 million), and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($7 million), partially offset by an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,482 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,903 million in 2010 increased by $1,488 million from $3,415 million for the same period of 2009 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,034 million); the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. ($210 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($45 million); partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($461 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($327 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $2,303 million in 2010 included proceeds from the issuances of long term debt ($2,479 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($35 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2010 included cash dividend payments ($153 million), the repayment of long term debt ($37 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($8 million). 39 2009 compared to 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,922 million in 2009 decreased $1,711 million from $4,633 million in 2008 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($2,823 million); unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($335 million); an increase in cash operating expenses ($125 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($53 million); partially offset by a favorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,414 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($243 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($43 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,415 million in 2009 decreased by $1,552 million from $4,967 million for the same period of 2008 due primarily to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,542 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($150 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($34 million); partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($172 million). Proceeds from sales of assets included net proceeds from the sale of EOGs California assets in December 2009 ($200 million) and net proceeds from the sale of EOGs Appalachian assets in February 2008 ($386 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $834 million in 2009 included the issuance of long term debt ($900 million), excess tax benefits from stock based compensation ($76 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($20 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2009 included cash dividend payments ($142 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($9 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): Actual 2010 2009 2008 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 4,634 $ 2,417 $ 3,990 Leasehold Acquisitions 399 424 521 Property Acquisitions (1) 18 707 109 Capitalized Interest 76 55 43 Subtotal 5,127 3,603 4,663 Exploration Costs 187 170 194 Dry Hole Costs 72 51 55 Exploration and Development Expenditures 5,386 3,824 4,912 Asset Retirement Costs 72 84 181 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 5,458 3,908 5,093 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (2) 581 326 477 Total Expenditures $ 6,039 $ 4,234 $ 5,570 (1) In 2009, property acquisitions included non cash additions of $353 million related to a property exchange transaction in the Rocky Mountain area. In 2009 and 2010, property acquisitions also included non cash additions for contingent consideration, with estimated fair values of $35 million and $3 million, respectively, related to the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets (see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) In 2010, other property, plant and equipment included $210 million for the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. (see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements). 40 Exploration and development expenditures of $5,386 million for 2010 were $1,562 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,932 million), Canada ($134 million), Trinidad ($104 million) and China ($15 million); unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in Canada ($58 million); increased capitalized interest in the United States ($21 million); increased employee related exploration costs in the United States ($11 million); and increased dry hole costs in the United Kingdom ($11 million) and Canada ($10 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased property acquisition expenditures in the United States ($689 million), decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the U nited States ($20 million) and decreased dry hole costs in the United States ($9 million). The 2010 exploration and development expenditures of $5,386 million included $4,366 million in development, $926 million in exploration, $76 million in capitalized interest and $18 million in property acquisitions. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment was primarily due to the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. The 2009 exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million included $2,082 million in development, $980 million in exploration, $707 million in property acquisitions and $55 million in capitalized interest. The decrease in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. The 2008 exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million included $3,612 million in development, $1,148 million in exploration, $109 million in property acquisitions and $43 million in capitalized interest. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Financial Price Swap Contracts. The total fair value of EOGs crude oil and natural gas financial price swap contracts is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 as an asset of $69 million and a liability of $21 million, respectively. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs crude oil and natural gas financial price swap contracts at February 24, 2011, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl) and in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu), as applicable. Financial Price Swap Contracts Crude Oil Natural Gas Volume (Bbld) Weighted Average Price ($/Bbl) Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu) 2011 (1) January 2011 (2) 17,000 $ 90.44 275,000 $ 5.19 February 1, 2011 through March 31, 2011 (3) 18,000 90.69 425,000 5.09 April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 20,000 91.48 425,000 5.09 2012 (4) January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 2,000 $ 100.50 250,000 $ 5.56 (1) Natural gas financial price swap contracts include unexercised swaption contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into price swap contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOGs existing natural gas financial price swap contracts will increase by 275,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.90 per MMBtu for the period from April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (2) The crude oil and natural gas contracts for January 2011 are closed. (3) The crude oil contracts for February 2011 through March 2011 will close February 28, 2011 and March 31, 2011, respectively. The natural gas contracts for February 2011 through March 2011 are closed. (4) Natural gas financial price swap contracts include unexercised swaption contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into price swap contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOGs existing natural gas financial price swap contracts will increase by 150,000 MMBtud at an average price of $5.64 per MMBtu for each month of 2012. Financial Basis Swap Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its natural gas production generally vary from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into natural gas financial basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between prices in the Rocky Mountain area and NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The total fair value of EOGs natural gas financial basis swap contracts is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 as a liability of $9 million. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas financial basis swap contracts at February 24, 2011. The weighted average pr ice differential represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX gas prices per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for the notional volumes covered by the basis swap. Natural Gas Financial Basis Swap Contracts Volume Weighted Average Price Differential (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2011 First Quarter (closed) 65,000 $(1.89) 42 Financing EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 34% at December 31, 2010 compared to 22% at December 31, 2009. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long term debt and total stockholders equity. During 2010, total debt increased $2,463 million to $5,260 million. The estimated fair value of EOGs debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5,602 million and $3,056 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year end. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2010, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $330 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2010, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of the Fixed Rate Notes, Floating Rate Notes and Notes described below, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2010 was $1,039 million, and the amount outstanding at year end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2010 was $14 million with no amounts outstanding at year end. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $191 million and $0. 1 million, respectively, during the year 2010. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the two $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreements with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On November 23, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (2016 Notes), $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) (together, the Fixed Rate Notes) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the Floating Rate Notes). Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2011. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 3, May 3, August 3 and November 3 of each year, beginning on February 3, 2011 and is based on the three month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum. The interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes resets quarterly on the interest payment dates. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1,487 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Contemporaneously with the offering of the Floating Rate Notes, EOG entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes at 1.87%. On May 20, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% Senior Notes due 2015 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 (together, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2010. Net proceeds from the Notes offering of approximately $990 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. On May 21, 2009, EOG completed its public offering of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes). Interest on the 2019 Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $891 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 43 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 (in thousands): 2016 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Beyond Current and Long Term Debt $ 5,260,000 $ 220,000 $ 400,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 3,640,000 Non Cancelable Operating Leases 357,049 107,174 60,637 47,562 141,676 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 1,808,415 237,367 470,035 391,356 709,657 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 3,315,075 305,529 688,817 777,117 1,543,612 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 355,277 213,442 135,867 5,968 Seismic Purchase Obligations 4,050 4,050 Fracturing Services Obligations 367,656 220,858 121,283 25,515 Other Purchase Obligations 219,796 218,808 669 319 Total Contractual Obligations $ 11,687,318 $ 1,527,228 $ 1,877,308 $ 2,247,837 $ 6,034,945 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2010. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOGs expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2010, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the U.K. and China. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2010 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2010 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect ag ainst the foreign currency exchange rate risk. 44 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2010, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $55 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2011 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOGs financi al position. Including the impact of EOGs 2011 crude oil hedges and based on EOGs tax position, EOGs price sensitivity in 2011 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $26 million for net income and $38 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOGs 2011 natural gas hedges, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2011 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $19 million for net income and $28 million for cash flows from opera ting activities. For information regarding EOGs crude oil and natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2010, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Bakken and Three Forks and Barnett Combo plays and, to a lesser extent, natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities. The total anticipated 2011 capital expenditures of $6.4 to $6.6 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOGs strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain non core natural gas assets. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and equity and debt offerings. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2011 by 9.5% over 2010 levels. Total liquids production is expected to increase by 49%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 55% and 34%, respectively. North American natural gas production is expected to decrease by 5% from 2010 levels. 45 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the d evelopment, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change su bstantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. 46 Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and or property dispositions and impairments. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Stock Based Compensation In accounting for stock based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOGs common stock, the level of risk free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOGs stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOGs future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOGs management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOGs future operating results and returns or EOGs ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production or generate income or cash flows are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOGs forward looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOGs control. Important factors that could cause EOGs actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOGs fo rward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling and advanced completion technologies; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, and to produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects, given the risks and uncertainties inherent in drilling, completing and operating crude oil and natural gas wells and the potential for interruptions of development and production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; 47 the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste disposal and hydraulic fracturing and laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations; EOGs ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; the extent to which EOGs third party operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of production, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the ability of EOGs customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOGs ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and the other factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors", on pages 14 through 20 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOGs subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q or Current Reports on Form 8 K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOGs forward looking statements. EOGs forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise. 48 ITEM 7A.
