ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOGs strategy. Net income for 2011 totaled $1,091 million as compared to $161 million for 2010. At December 31, 2011, EOGs total estimated net proved reserves were 2,054 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 104 MMBoe from December 31, 2010. During 2011, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids reserves increased by 207 million barrels (MMBbl) and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 619 billion cubic feet (Bcf) or 103 MMBoe. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2011. United States and Canada. EOGs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOGs crude oil and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise gained from its natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil and liquids rich reservoirs. In 2011, EOG focused its efforts on developing its existing North American crude oil and condensate and liquids rich acreage. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential liquids rich exploration and development prospects. During 2011, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 37% of total company production as compared to 27% during 2010. North American liquids production accounted for approximately 42% of total North American production during 2011 as compared to 31% in 2010. This liquids growth reflects production from EOGs 572,000 net acre position in the oil window of the Eagle Ford Shale play near San Antonio, Texas, and increasing amounts of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. In 2011, EOGs net Eagle Ford Shale production averaged 34.1 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to 4.3 MBbld in 2010. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2012 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2011. EOGs major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. EOG delivers its crude oil to various markets in the United States, including sales points on the Gulf Coast. Most recently, with increases in crude oil production from the Eagle Ford Shale play, EOG has increased sales to the Gulf Coast and is receiving pricing for those sales based on the Light Louisiana Sweet price. In order to create further market diversification for its growing crude oil production, EOG is expanding its crude by rail system to have the capability to increase deliveries of crude oil to St. James, Louisiana, beginning in the second quarter of 2012. In addition, to further reduce well completion costs, EOG began using sand from its Wisconsin sand mine and sand processing facilities in late 2011. 31 In March 2011, EOGs wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, EOG Resources Canada Inc. (EOGRC), purchased an additional 24.5% interest in the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines (PTP) for $25.2 million. The PTP is intended to link western Canadas natural gas producing regions to the planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal to be located at Bish Cove, near the Port of Kitimat, north of Vancouver, British Columbia (Kitimat LNG Terminal). A portion of the purchase price ($15.3 million) was paid at closing with the remaining amount to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the Kitimat LNG Terminal. Additionally, in March 2011, EOGRC and an affiliate of Apache Corporation (Apache), through a series of transactions, sold a portion of their interests in the Kitimat LNG Terminal and PTP to an affiliate of Encana Corporation (Encana). Subsequent to these transactions, ownership interests in both the Kitimat LNG Terminal and PTP are: Apache (operator) 40%, EOGRC 30% and Encana 30%. All future costs of the project will be paid by each party in proportion to its respective ownership percentage. In the first quarter of 2011, EOGRC and Apache awarded a front end engineering and design contract to a global engineering company with the final report expected in the second half of 2012. In October 2011, the Canadian National Energy Board granted a 20 year export license to ship LNG from the Kitimat LNG Terminal to international markets. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block and Modified U(b) Block, as well as the Pelican Field, have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate. In Block 4(a), EOG drilled and completed six development wells in the Toucan Field and one in the EMZ Area in 2011. Production from all seven wells began in February 2012 to supply natural gas under a contract with the Natural Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. EOG sourced the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the Toucan Field began producing. In 2006, EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited (EOGUK) participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f. EOG has a 25% non operating interest in this block. A successful Columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007. The field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in the first half of 2012. The operator and partners are continuing to negotiate processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners. In 2009, EOGUK drilled a successful exploratory well in its East Irish Sea Blocks 110/7b and 110/12a. Well 110/12 6, in which EOGUK has a 100% working interest, was an oil discovery and was designated the Conwy field. In 2010, EOGUK added an adjoining field in its East Irish Sea block, designated Corfe, to its overall development plans. During 2011, offshore facilities fabrication began, line pipe was fabricated and all principal facilities and drilling contracts were signed. Field development plans for the Conwy and Corfe fields were submitted to the DECC during the first quarter of 2011. Regulatory approval of both plans is expected during the first quarter of 2012. Installation of facilities, pipelines and drilling of development wells are planned for 2012 with initial production expected during the first quarter of 2013. The licenses for the East Irish Sea blocks were awarded to EOGUK in 2007. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired. During the first quarter of 2011, EOG completed one horizontal well. During 2011, EOG signed two exploration contracts and one farm in agreement covering approximately 100,000 net acres in the Neuqun Basin in Neuqun Province, Argentina. During the third quarter of 2011, EOG performed exploration activity on a portion of this acreage in preparation for drilling a well targeting the Vaca Muerta oil shale in the Aguada del Chivato Block. EOG began drilling this well in January 2012. In the first quarter of 2012, EOG plans to participate in the drilling of a second well in the Bajo de Toro Block targeting the Vaca Muerta oil shale. EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 32 Capital Structure One of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOGs peer group. EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 28% and 34% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long term debt and total stockholders equity. During 2011, EOG funded $7.1 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $220 million in long term debt, paid $167 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $24 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds of $1,388 million from the sale of common stock and proceeds of $1,433 million from the sale of certain North American assets and the sale of a portion of EOGs interest in the Kitimat LNG Terminal and PTP. On October 11, 2011, EOG entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (2011 Facility) with domestic and foreign lenders. The 2011 Facility replaced EOGs two $1.0 billion senior unsecured credit facilities which were cancelled by EOG upon the closing of the 2011 Facility. Unamortized fees relating to the cancelled facilities totaling $5.7 million were written off in the fourth quarter of 2011. The 2011 Facility has a scheduled maturity date of October 11, 2016 and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one year periods. On March 7, 2011, EOG completed the sale of 13,570,000 shares of EOG common stock, par value $0.01 per share (Common Stock), at the public offering price of $105.50 per share. Net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock were approximately $1,388 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. Proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Total anticipated 2012 capital expenditures are expected to range from $7.4 to $7.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2012 expenditures will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil and liquids rich gas drilling activity and, to a much lesser extent, natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays to hold acreage. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2012. EOGs business plan includes selling certain non core assets in 2012 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under the 2011 Facility and equity and debt offerings. When it fits EOGs strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOGs history. 33 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F 1. Net Operating Revenues During 2011, net operating revenues increased $4,026 million, or 66%, to $10,126 million from $6,100 million in 2010. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOGs production of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas, in 2011 increased $1,977 million, or 41%, to $6,858 million from $4,881 million in 2010. During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million compared to net gains of $62 million in 2010. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third party natural gas, increased $1,206 million, or 133%, during 2011, to $2,116 million from $910 million in 2010. Gains on asset dispositions, net, totaled $493 million and $224 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily as a result of asset dispositions in the Rocky Mountain area and Texas in 2011 and in the Rocky Mountain area in 2010. 34 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 102.0 63.2 47.9 Canada 7.9 6.7 4.1 Trinidad 3.4 4.7 3.1 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 113.4 74.7 55.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 92.92 $ 74.88 $ 54.42 Canada 91.92 72.66 57.72 Trinidad 90.62 68.80 50.85 Other International (2) 100.11 73.11 53.07 Composite 92.79 74.29 54.46 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 41.5 29.5 22.5 Canada 0.9 0.9 1.1 Total 42.4 30.4 23.6 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 50.37 $ 41.68 $ 30.03 Canada 52.69 43.40 30.49 Composite 50.41 41.73 30.05 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,113 1,133 1,134 Canada 132 200 224 Trinidad 344 341 273 Other International (2) 13 14 14 Total 1,602 1,688 1,645 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 3.92 $ 4.30 $ 3.72 Canada 3.71 3.91 3.85 Trinidad 3.53 2.65 1.73 Other International (2) 5.62 4.90 4.34 Composite 3.83 3.93 3.42 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 329.1 281.5 259.4 Canada 30.7 40.9 42.6 Trinidad 60.7 61.5 48.5 Other International (2) 2.2 2.5 2.4 Total 422.7 386.4 352.9 Total MMBoe (4) 154.3 141.1 128.8 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.

Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (4) Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 35 2011 compared to 2010. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2011 increased $1,839 million, or 92%, to $3,838 million from $1,999 million in 2010, due to an increase of 39 MBbld, or 52%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($1,074 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($765 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in Texas (35 MBbld) and Colorado (3 MBbld). Production increases in Texas were the result of increased production from the Eagle Ford Shale (26 MBbld) and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Combo (8 MBbld) plays. EOGs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2011 increased 25% to $92.79 per barrel compared to $74.29 per barrel in 2010. Natural gas liquids revenues in 2011 increased $317 million, or 69%, to $779 million from $462 million in 2010, due to an increase of 12 MBbld, or 39%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($183 million) and a higher composite average price ($134 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale (6 MBbld), the Eagle Ford Shale (4 MBbld) and the Rocky Mountain area (3 MBbld). EOGs composite average natural gas liquids price in 2011 increased 21% to $50.41 per barrel compared to $41.73 per barrel in 2010. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2011 decreased $179 million, or 7%, to $2,241 million from $2,420 million in 2010. The decrease was due to reduced natural gas deliveries ($123 million) and a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($56 million). EOGs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 3% to $3.83 per Mcf in 2011 from $3.93 per Mcf in 2010. Natural gas deliveries in 2011 decreased 86 MMcfd, or 5%, to 1,602 MMcfd from 1,688 MMcfd in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower production in Canada (68 MMcfd) and the United States (20 MMcfd). The decrease in Canada primarily reflects sales of certain shallow natural gas assets in 2010, partially offset by increased production from the Horn River Basin area. The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production in the Rocky Mountain area (36 MMcfd), Louisiana (17 MMcfd), Mississippi (11 MMcfd), New Mexico (8 MMcfd) and Kansas (5 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Texas (38 MMcfd) and Pennsylvania (23 MMcfd). During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net realized gains of $181 million. During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as fees associated with gathering third party natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third party crude oil and natural gas. The purchase and sale of third party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs. During 2011, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2011 increased $19 million to $44 million from $25 million in 2010, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. 2010 compared to 2009. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2010 increased $909 million, or 83%, to $1,999 million from $1,090 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($533 million) and an increase of 20 MBbld, or 35%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($376 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in Texas (8 MBbld), North Dakota (7 MBbld), Canada (3 MBbld) and Trinidad (2 MBbld). Production increases in Texas were the result of increased production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Combo and the Eagle Ford plays. Production increases in North Dakota resulted from increased deliveries from the Bakken and Three Forks plays. EOGs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2010 increased 36% to $74.29 per barrel compared to $54.46 per barrel in 2009. 36 Natural gas liquids revenues in 2010 increased $203 million, or 79%, to $462 million from $259 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average price ($129 million) and an increase of 7 MBbld, or 29%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($74 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. EOGs composite average natural gas liquids price in 2010 increased 39% to $41.73 per barrel compared to $30.05 per barrel in 2009. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2010 increased $369 million, or 18%, to $2,420 million from $2,051 million in 2009. The increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($316 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($53 million). EOGs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 15% to $3.93 per Mcf in 2010 from $3.42 per Mcf in 2009. Natural gas deliveries in 2010 increased 43 MMcfd, or 3%, to 1,688 MMcfd from 1,645 MMcfd in 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher production in Trinidad (68 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in Canada (24 MMcfd) and the United States (1 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was primarily attributable to deliveries under a take or pay contract, which began January 1, 2010. The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production in the Rocky Mountain area (28 MMcfd), offshore Gulf of Mexico (9 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Texas (5 MMcfd), Kansas (5 MMcfd) and Mississippi (4 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (45 MMcfd) and Pennsylvania (11 MMcfd). During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2010, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2010 totaled $25 million compared to $10 million in 2009, primarily as a result of higher crude oil marketing margins. Operating and Other Expenses 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, operating expenses of $8,013 million were $2,436 million higher than the $5,577 million incurred in 2010. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Lease and Well $ 6.11 $ 4.96 Transportation Costs 2.79 2.74 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) Oil and Gas Properties (1) 15.52 13.19 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.79 0.79 General and Administrative (G&A) 1.98 1.99 Net Interest Expense 1.36 0.92 Total (2) $ 28.55 $ 24.59 (1) The 2010 amount excludes the reductions in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $24 million, or $0.17 per Boe related to the acquisition of certain unproved acreage. (2) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2011 compared to 2010 are set forth below. 37 Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOGs crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. In general, operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas. Lease and well expenses of $942 million in 2011 increased $244 million from $698 million in 2010 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($188 million), increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($33 million), increased workover expenditures in the United States ($11 million) and Canada ($4 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million), partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in Canada ($4 million). Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs, transportation fees and costs associated with crude by rail operations. Transportation costs of $430 million in 2011 increased $45 million from $385 million in 2010 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford Shale ($30 million), the Upper Gulf Coast area ($16 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($9 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in Canada ($4 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($2 million) and the South Texas area ($2 million). The net increase in transportation costs primarily reflects increased volumes transported to downstream markets. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. EOGs DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOGs composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consists of gathering and processing assets, compressors, crude by rail assets, sand mine and sand processing assets, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2011 increased $574 million to $2,516 million from $1,942 million in 2010. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2011 were $563 million higher than in 2010 primarily due to higher unit rates as described above ($375 million), increased production in the United States ($249 million), a reduction during 2010 in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability ($24 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($11 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($77 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($306 million), Trinidad ($37 million) and Canada ($9 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $11 million higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the Eagle Ford Shale ($5 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($3 million). G&A expenses of $305 million in 2011 were $25 million higher than 2010 due primarily to higher employee related costs. 38 Net interest expense of $210 million in 2011 increased $80 million from $130 million in 2010 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($56 million), lower capitalized interest ($18 million) and the write off of fees associated with revolving credit facilities cancelled in 2011 in connection with the establishment of the 2011 Facility ($6 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOGs gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $14 million to $81 million in 2011 compared to $67 million in 2010. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($10 million), the Eagle Ford Shale ($5 million) and Canada ($5 million), partially offset by decreased activities in the Upper Gulf Coast region ($5 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($4 million). Exploration costs of $172 million in 2011 decreased $15 million from $187 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach as described in the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). For certain natural gas assets held for sale, EOG utilized accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Impairments of $1,031 million in 2011 increased $288 million from $743 million in 2010 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment in the United States. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment of $834 million and $526 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2011 amount includes impairments of $745 million related to certain North American natural gas assets as a result of declining commodity prices and accepted bids. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2011 increased $94 million to $411 million (6% of wellhead revenues) from $317 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) in 2010. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($101 million) and a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2011 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit ($8 million), partially offset by lower ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($9 million) and Canada ($4 million) and decreased severance/production taxes in Trinidad ($4 million). Other income, net was $7 million in 2011 compared to $14 million in 2010. The decrease of $7 million was primarily due to operating losses on EOGs investment in the PTP ($5 million) and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses ($5 million), partially offset by higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($3 million). 39 Income tax provision of $819 million in 2011 increased $572 million from $247 million in 2010 due primarily to greater pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2011 decreased to 43% from 61% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 exceeded the United States statutory tax rate (35%) due mostly to foreign earnings in Trinidad (55% statutory tax rate) combined with losses in Canada (27% statutory tax rate). 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, operating expenses of $5,577 million were $1,761 million higher than the $3,816 million incurred in 2009. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Lease and Well $ 4.96 $ 4.50 Transportation Costs 2.74 2.20 DD&A Oil and Gas Properties (1) 13.19 11.29 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.79 0.74 G&A 1.99 1.93 Net Interest Expense 0.92 0.78 Total (2) $ 24.59 $ 21.44 (1) The 2010 amount excludes the reductions in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $24 million, or $0.17 per Boe related to the acquisition of certain unproved acreage. (2) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2010 compared to 2009 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $698 million in 2010 increased $119 million from $579 million in 2009 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($67 million) and Canada ($6 million), increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($27 million), primarily due to higher costs associated with increased crude oil activities, unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($14 million) and increased workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Canada ($2 million). Transportation costs of $385 million in 2010 increased $102 million from $283 million in 2009 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($46 million), the Upper Gulf Coast area ($29 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($29 million). These increases reflect costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production to downstream markets. The increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area also include costs associated with EOGs crude by rail operations, which began transporting crude oil from Stanley, North Dakota, to Cushing, Oklahoma, at the end of December 2009. DD&A expenses in 2010 increased $393 million to $1,942 million from $1,549 million in 2009. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2010 were $378 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($97 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($2 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($8 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($167 million), Canada ($86 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($8 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($28 million), partially offset by a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability ($24 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $15 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants being placed in service in the Rocky Mountain area ($10 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($4 million). G&A expenses of $280 million in 2010 were $32 million higher than 2009 due primarily to higher employee related costs ($10 million), higher legal and other professional fees ($7 million) and higher information systems costs ($3 million). 40 Net interest expense of $130 million in 2010 increased $29 million from $101 million in 2009 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($50 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($21 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $9 million to $67 million in 2010 compared to $58 million in 2009. The increase reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($6 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($3 million). Exploration costs of $187 million in 2010 increased $17 million from $170 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased employee related costs in the United States. Impairments of $743 million in 2010 increased $437 million from $306 million in 2009 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment in Canada. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment of $526 million and $94 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, EOG recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to adjust certain Canadian shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, EOG recorded pretax impairments of $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to certain North American onshore and offshore natural gas assets. Taxes other than income in 2010 increased $143 million to $317 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) in 2009. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($56 million), Trinidad ($22 million) and Canada ($6 million); a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2010 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit ($43 million); and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($14 million). Other income, net was $14 million in 2010 compared to $2 million in 2009. The increase of $12 million was primarily due to higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($9 million). Income tax provision of $247 million in 2010 decreased $78 million compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2010 increased to 61% from 37% in 2009. The increase in the 2010 net effective tax rate was primarily due to higher state income taxes and to the tax effects of increased earnings in Trinidad and Canadian book losses, which resulted largely from the impairment of certain Canadian shallow natural gas assets. The statutory tax rates in the United States and Trinidad are higher than the Canadian statutory rate. 41 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three year period ended December 31, 2011 were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long term debt, proceeds from asset sales, net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; and repayments of debt. 2011 compared to 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,578 million in 2011 increased $1,869 million from $2,709 million in 2010 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,977 million), favorable changes in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($174 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($137 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($383 million), an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($40 million) and an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($27 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $5,755 million in 2011 increased by $852 million from $4,903 million for the same period of 2010 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,084 million), unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($446 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($286 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($761 million) and the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. in 2010 ($210 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $1,009 million in 2011 included net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock ($1,388 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($36 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2011 included the repayment of long term debt ($220 million), cash dividend payments ($167 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($24 million) and debt issuance costs associated with the establishment of the 2011 Facility ($5 million). 2010 compared to 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,709 million in 2010 decreased $213 million from $2,922 million in 2009 primarily reflecting an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,271 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($410 million), an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($182 million), an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($46 million), and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($7 million), partially offset by an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,482 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,903 million in 2010 increased by $1,488 million from $3,415 million for the same period of 2009 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,034 million); the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. ($210 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($45 million); partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($461 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($327 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $2,303 million in 2010 included proceeds from the issuances of long term debt ($2,479 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($35 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2010 included cash dividend payments ($153 million), the repayment of long term debt ($37 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($8 million). 42 Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): Actual 2011 2010 2009 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 5,878 $ 4,634 $ 2,417 Leasehold Acquisitions 301 399 424 Property Acquisitions (1) 4 18 707 Capitalized Interest 58 76 55 Subtotal 6,241 5,127 3,603 Exploration Costs 172 187 170 Dry Hole Costs 53 72 51 Exploration and Development Expenditures 6,466 5,386 3,824 Asset Retirement Costs 133 72 84 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 6,599 5,458 3,908 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (2) 656 581 326 Total Expenditures $ 7,255 $ 6,039 $ 4,234 (1) In 2009, property acquisitions included non cash additions of $353 million related to a property exchange transaction in the Rocky Mountain area. In 2009 and 2010, property acquisitions also included non cash additions for contingent consideration, with estimated fair values of $35 million and $3 million, respectively, related to the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) In 2010, other property, plant and equipment included $210 million for the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Exploration and development expenditures of $6,466 million for 2011 were $1,080 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,421 million) and the United Kingdom ($62 million), increased dry hole costs in China ($22 million) and unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in Canada ($15 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in Canada ($181 million) and China ($70 million); decreased leasehold acquisitions expenditures in the United States ($90 million) and Canada ($8 million); decreased dry hole costs in the United Kingdom ($22 million), Canada ($14 million) and Trinidad ($5 million); decreased capitalized interest in the United States ($18 million); decreased property acquisition expenditures in the United States ($14 million); and decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($13 million). The 2011 exploration and development expenditures of $6,466 million included $5,797 million in development, $607 million in exploration, $58 million in capitalized interest and $4 million in property acquisitions. In 2011, other property, plant and equipment expenditures included $231 million for sand mine and sand processing assets. The 2010 exploration and development expenditures of $5,386 million included $4,366 million in development, $926 million in exploration, $76 million in capitalized interest and $18 million in property acquisitions. In 2010, other property, plant and equipment expenditures included $210 million for the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. The 2009 exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million included $2,082 million in development, $980 million in exploration, $707 million in property acquisitions and $55 million in capitalized interest. In 2009, other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 43 Derivative Transactions During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net realized gains of $181 million. During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark to market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commodity Derivative Contracts. The total fair value of EOGs crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 as an asset of $486 million. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs crude oil derivative contracts at February 24, 2012, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl). Crude Oil Derivative Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (Bbld) ($/Bbl) 2012 (1) January 2012 (closed) 34,000 $ 104.95 February 2012 34,000 104.95 March 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012 52,000 105.80 July 1, 2012 through August 31, 2012 35,000 105.56 September 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 17,000 103.59 (1) EOG has entered into crude oil derivative contracts which give counterparties the option to extend certain current derivative contracts for an additional six month period. Options covering a notional volume of 17,000 Bbld are exercisable on June 29, 2012. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOGs existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 17,000 Bbld at an average price of $106.31 per barrel for the period July 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. Options covering a notional volume of 18,000 Bbld are exercisable on August 31, 2012. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOGs existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 18,000 Bbld at an average price of $107.42 per barrel for the period September 1, 2012 through February 28, 2013. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOGs natural gas derivative contracts as of February 24, 2012, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtu per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu). Natural Gas Derivative Contracts Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu) 2012 (1) January 2012 through February 29, 2012 (closed) 525,000 $ 5.44 March 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 525,000 5.44 2013 (2) January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 150,000 $ 4.79 2014 (2) January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 150,000 $ 4.79 (1) EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOGs existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 425,000 MMBtud at an average price of $5.44 per MMBtu for the period from March 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. (2) EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOGs existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 150,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.79 per MMBtu for each month of 2013 and 2014. 44 Financing EOGs debt to total capitalization ratio was 28% at December 31, 2011 compared to 34% at December 31, 2010. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long term debt and total stockholders equity. During 2011, total debt outstanding decreased $220 million to $5,040 million. The estimated fair value of EOGs debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $5,657 million and $5,602 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year end. EOGs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2011, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $315 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2011, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the public offering of EOG Common Stock described below and proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2011 was $182 million, and the amount outstanding at year end was zero. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were $3 million during the year 2011. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the 2011 Facility described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On March 7, 2011, EOG completed the sale of 13,570,000 shares of Common Stock at the public offering price of $105.50 per share. Net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock were approximately $1,388 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. Proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 (in thousands): 2017 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Beyond Current and Long Term Debt $ 5,040,000 $ $ 900,000 $ 900,000 $ 3,240,000 Non Cancelable Operating Leases 502,076 173,061 97,515 68,231 163,269 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 1,570,811 234,918 436,864 366,370 532,659 Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 3,256,452 359,686 779,585 844,944 1,272,237 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 339,206 230,541 105,319 3,346 Seismic Purchase Obligations 4,087 4,087 Fracturing Services Obligations 338,585 301,851 27,827 8,907 Other Purchase Obligations 120,108 116,533 3,489 86 Total Contractual Obligations $ 11,171,325 $ 1,420,677 $ 2,350,599 $ 2,191,884 $ 5,208,165 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOGs pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2011. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOGs expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). 45 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2011, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Argentina. The foreign currency most significant to EOGs operations during 2011 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2011 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOGs Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2011, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $52 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2012 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOGs financial position. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Including the impact of EOGs 2012 crude oil derivative contracts and based on EOGs tax position, EOGs price sensitivity in 2012 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $31 million for net income and $46 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOGs 2012 natural gas derivative contracts, based on EOGs tax position and the portion of EOGs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2012 for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts, EOGs price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $11 million for net income and $16 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOGs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts as of February 24, 2012, see "Derivative Transactions" above. 46 Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil and liquids rich drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Bakken and Three Forks, Barnett Combo, Wolfcamp and Leonard Shale plays and, to a much lesser extent, United States and Canada natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays to hold acreage. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities. The total anticipated 2012 capital expenditures of $7.4 to $7.6 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOGs strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain non core assets. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2012. EOGs business plan includes selling certain non core assets in 2012 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under the 2011 Facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2012 by 5.5% over 2011 levels. Total liquids production is expected to increase by 30%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 30% and 30%, respectively. North American natural gas production is expected to decrease by 11% from 2011 levels. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOGs most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOGs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. 47 Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOGs calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and or property dispositions and impairments. Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. 48 When circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOGs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of future undiscounted cash flows require significant judgment. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the past five years, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $30 per barrel (Bbl) to $145 per Bbl and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.83 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) to $13 per MMBtu. EOGs proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if actual crude oil and or natural gas prices and or actual production diverge negatively from EOGs current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary. Stock Based Compensation In accounting for stock based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOGs Common Stock, the level of risk free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOGs Common Stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOGs future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOGs management for future operations, are forward looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOGs future operating results and returns or EOGs ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOGs forward looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOGs control. Important factors that could cause EOGs actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOGs forward looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling, advanced completion technologies and hydraulic fracturing; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, and to produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects, given the risks and uncertainties and capital expenditure requirements inherent in drilling, completing and operating crude oil and natural gas wells and the potential for interruptions of development and production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production; 49 the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water, laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; EOGs ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; the extent to which EOGs third party operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of production, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the ability of EOGs customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOGs ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and the other factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors", on pages 15 through 23 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOGs subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q or Current Reports on Form 8 K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOGs forward looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOGs forward looking statements. EOGs forward looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise. 50 ITEM 7A.
