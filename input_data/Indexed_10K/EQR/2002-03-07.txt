Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Companys ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the 34 Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Results of Operations The following table summarizes the number of Properties and related units for the year to date periods presented: Properties Units Purchase / Sale Price $ Millions At December 31, 1999 1,064 226,317 2000 Acquisitions 29 5,952 $ 743.4 Grove Merger 60 7,308 $ 463.2 2000 Dispositions (53 ) (12,813 ) $ 631.6 2000 Completed Developments 4 940 At December 31, 2000 1,104 227,704 2001 Acquisitions 14 3,423 $ 388.1 2001 Dispositions (49 ) (8,807 ) $ 416.9 2001 Completed Developments 7 2,505 Unit Configuration Changes (24 ) At December 31, 2001 1,076 224,801 The Companys acquisition and disposition activity has impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Significant changes in revenues and expenses have resulted primarily from the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties and the acquisition of Globe in July 2000, as well as the 2001 and the 2000 Acquired Properties, which have been partially offset by the disposition of the 2001 and the 2000 Disposed Properties. Significant change in expenses has also resulted from impairment charges (furniture rental and unconsolidated technology investments) recorded in 2001. This impact is discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs. 35 Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2001 and 2000 (the "2001 Same Store Properties"), which represented 181,951 units, impacted the Companys results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2000 and 1999 (the "2000 Same Store Properties"), which represented 155,910 units, also impacted the Companys results of operations. Both the 2001 Same Store Properties and 2000 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31, 2000 For the year ended December 31, 2001, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of real estate, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately $39.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Revenues from the 2001 Same Store Properties increased primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to new residents and resident renewals and an increase in income from billing residents for their share of utility costs as well as other ancillary services provided to residents. Property operating expenses from the 2001 Same Store Properties, which include property and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, increased primarily attributable to a $5.4 million, or 5.6%, increase in utilities and an $8.2 million, or 5.5%, increase in payroll costs. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expenses, net operating income and weighted average occupancy for the 2001 Same Store Properties: Same Store Net Operating Income ("NOI") $ in Millions 181,951 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses NOI 2001 $ 1,721.2 $ 626.4 $ 1,094.8 2000 $ 1,658.7 $ 604.1 $ 1,054.6 Change $ 62.5 $ 22.3 $ 40.2 Change 3.8 % 3.7 % 3.8 % Same Store Occupancy Statistics 2001 94.40 % 2000 94.91 % Change (0.51 %) For 2002 Properties which the Company acquired prior to December 31, 2000 and will continue to own through December 31, 2002, the Company expects to see revenue growth within a range of being slightly lower by 1.25% to slightly higher by as much as 0.5%; to maintain expense growth between a range of 1.0% to 1.5%; and expects NOI within a range of being slightly lower by 2.9% to slightly higher by 0.2%. These estimated changes are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, maintaining an overall average occupancy rate of 93.0%. Rental income from properties other than 2001 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $57.4 million primarily as a result of revenue from the Companys 2001 and 2000 Acquired Properties, additional 2001 Partially Owned Properties, and the 2001 Disposition Properties. Interest income investment in mortgage notes decreased by approximately $2.4 million as a result of the Company consolidating these previously Unconsolidated Properties in July 2001. The Company anticipates no additional interest income will be recognized on these mortgage notes in future years as the Company now consolidates the results related to these previously Unconsolidated Properties. 36 Interest and other income decreased by approximately $3.4 million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on the Companys short term investment accounts. Property management expenses include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys Properties. These expenses increased by approximately $0.7 million or less than 1%. The Company continues to acquire properties in major metropolitan areas and dispose of assets in smaller multi family rental markets where the Company does not have a significant management presence. As a result, the Company was able to maintain off site management expenses at a constant level between the two reporting periods. Fee and asset management revenues and fee and asset management expenses increased as a result of the Company continuing to manage Properties that were sold and or contributed to various unconsolidated joint venture entities. As of December 31, 2001, the Company managed 16,539 units for third parties and the unconsolidated joint venture entities. Furniture income and furniture expenses are associated with the operation of the furniture rental business assumed in connection with the Globe acquisition, which occurred in July 2000. Furniture expenses include a depreciation charge on furniture held in inventory and property and equipment directly related to the furniture business. The Company sold its furniture rental business for approximately $30.0 million on January 11, 2002. The Company recorded impairment charges in 2001 totaling approximately $71.8 million, of which $60.0 million is related to the furniture rental business and approximately $11.8 million is related to certain investments in technology entities. See Footnote 20 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $11.0 million. During 2001, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $28.2 million as compared to $17.7 million for the year ended 2000. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all of the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 6.90% as compared to 7.25% for the year ended December 31, 2000. For 2002, the Company expects to refinance approximately $550 million of indebtedness and to incur interest costs ranging from 6.5% to 7.0% per annum. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $9.0 million between the years under comparison. This increase was primarily due to the addition of corporate personnel, recruiting fees for the new President, retirement plan expenses for certain key executives, and higher overall compensation expenses including a current year expense associated with the vesting of restricted shares/awards to key employees earned over the past three years. Net gain on sales of real estate decreased approximately $49.1 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of a fewer number of units sold during the year ended December 31, 2001 (11,818 units including the joint venture Properties) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 (20,648 units including the joint venture Properties). Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 1999 For the year ended December 31, 2000, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of real estate, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased by $69.5 million, or 21.3%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. 37 Revenues from the 2000 Same Store Properties increased primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to new residents and resident renewals and an increase in income from billing residents for their share of utility costs as well as other ancillary services provided to residents. Property operating expenses from the 2000 Same Store Properties, which include property and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, increased primarily attributable to a $1.8 million, or 2.1%, increase in utilities and a $9.1 million, or 7.4% increase in payroll costs. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expenses, net operating income and weighted average occupancy for the 2000 Same Store Properties: Same Store Net Operating Income $ in Millions 155,910 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses NOI 2000 $ 1,471.4 $ 536.4 $ 935.0 1999 $ 1,406.4 $ 523.4 $ 883.0 Change $ 65.0 $ 13.0 $ 52.0 Change 4.6 % 2.5 % 5.9 % Same Store Occupancy Statistics 2000 94.94 % 1999 95.12 % Change (0.18 %) Rental income from properties other than 2000 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $178.3 million primarily as a result of revenue from the Companys corporate housing business and the acquisition of Properties during 2000, including the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties. Interest and other income increased by approximately $12.0 million, primarily as a result of disposition proceeds earning interest in various tax deferred 1031 exchange accounts. These proceeds are invested in money market investments until the Company purchases additional multi family properties. Property management expenses include expenses associated with the self management of the Companys Properties. These expenses increased by approximately $14.8 million primarily due to the continued expansion of the Companys property management business and higher overall compensation expenses. During 2000, the Company incurred the full year impact of assuming the property management business of LFT and also assumed management offices in Cincinnati, Ohio and Norwood, Massachusetts related to the acquisition of Globe and Grove, respectively. Also included in compensation expense is the current year expense associated with the vesting of restricted shares/awards to key employees earned over the past year. Fee and asset management revenues and fee and asset management expenses increased as a result of the Company continuing to manage Properties that were either sold and or contributed to various joint venture entities. Furniture income and furniture expenses are associated with the operation of the furniture rental business assumed in connection with the Globe acquisition, which occurred in July 2000. Furniture expenses include a depreciation charge on furniture held in inventory and property and equipment directly related to the furniture business. 38 The Company recorded impairment charges in 2000 totaling approximately $1.0 million related to certain investments in technology entities. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased by approximately $37.5 million. During 2000, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $17.7 million as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended 1999. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all of the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 7.25% as compared to 7.05% for the year ended December 31, 1999. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $4.1 million between the periods under comparison. This increase was primarily due to the addition of corporate personnel and higher overall compensation expenses including a current year expense associated with the awarding of restricted shares to key employees in 2000. Net gain on sales of real estate increased approximately $104.9 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of a larger number of units sold during the year ended December 31, 2000 (20,648 units, including the joint venture Properties) as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999 (9,183 units). Net loss from extraordinary items increased approximately $5.1 million related primarily to pre payment penalties incurred on the refinancing of $208 million in mortgage debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the Year Ended December 31, 2001 As of January 1, 2001, the Company had approximately $23.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $399.5 million available under its lines of credit, of which $53.5 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2001 was approximately $51.6 million and the amount available on the Companys line of credit was $505.0 million, of which $59.0 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). Part of the Companys acquisition and development funding strategy and the funding of the Companys investment in various joint ventures is to utilize its lines of credit and to subsequently repay the lines of credit from the disposition of Properties, retained cash flows or the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. Continuing to utilize this strategy during the year ended 2001, the Company: disposed of forty nine Properties (including two Unconsolidated Properties) and two vacant parcels of land and received net proceeds of $399.1 million; issued $300.0 million of unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $297.4 million; sold and or contributed eleven properties to a joint venture and received net proceeds of $167.6 million; issued approximately 3.6 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $74.4 million; issued $60.0 million of four new series of Preference Interests and received net proceeds of $58.5 million; obtained $91.6 million in new mortgage financing; and received $61.4 million of principal repayments on its investment in second and third mortgages on previously Unconsolidated Properties. All of these proceeds were utilized to either: repay the lines of credit; 39 redeem the Companys Series A and F Preferred Shares; repay mortgage indebtedness on selected Properties; repay public unsecured debt; invest in unconsolidated entities; and purchase additional Properties. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company: reduced its line of credit borrowings by approximately $160.5 million as compared to its December 31, 2000 balance outstanding; funded $210.5 million to redeem all of its Series A and F Preferred Shares; repaid approximately $364.2 million of mortgages due at or prior to maturity and or at the disposition date of respective Properties; funded a net of $174.6 million in accordance with its development and joint venture agreements; and acquired fourteen Properties and vacant land utilizing cash of $297.8 million. The Companys total debt summary, as of December 31, 2001, included: Debt Summary as of December 31, 2001 $ Millions Weighted Average Rate Secured $ 3,287 6.51 % Unsecured 2,456 6.32 % Total $ 5,743 6.43 % Fixed Rate $ 4,847 7.02 % Floating Rate 896 3.20 % Total $ 5,743 6.43 % Above Totals Include: Total Tax Exempt $ 975 4.41 % Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility $ 195 2.50 % From January 1, 2002 through February 5, 2002, the Company: disposed of four Properties consisting of 466 units for approximately $15.5 million; disposed of the furniture rental business for approximately $30.0 million in cash; repaid $1.9 million of mortgage debt at or prior to maturity on two Properties; and repaid $100.0 million of 9.375% fixed rate public notes at maturity. During 2002, the Company expects to fund approximately $33.5 million related to wholly owned developments and joint venture projects under development. In connection with one joint venture agreement, the Company has an obligation to fund up to an additional $6.5 million to guarantee third party construction financing. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has 22 projects under development with estimated completion dates ranging from March 31, 2002 through December 31, 2003. For one joint venture agreement, the Companys joint venture partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in 40 the project to the Company based on such value. If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value. The Companys joint venture partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property. For the second joint venture agreement, the Companys joint venture partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to require the Company to purchase the joint venture partners interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price. If the Company and the joint venture partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals. If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and the joint venture partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value. The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize the joint venture partner to sell the project at or above the agreed upon value to an unrelated third party. Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, any projects remaining unsold must be purchased by the Company at the agreed upon price. The Company has a policy of capitalizing expenditures made for new assets, including newly acquired Properties, and the costs associated with placing these assets into service. Expenditures for improvements and renovations that significantly enhance the value of existing assets or substantially extend the useful life of an asset are also capitalized. Expenditures for in the unit replacement type items such as appliances, draperies, carpeting and floor coverings, mechanical equipment and certain furniture and fixtures are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. With respect to acquired Properties, the Company has determined that it generally spends $1,000 per unit during its first three years of ownership to fully improve and enhance these Properties to meet the Companys standards. In regard to replacement type items described above, the Company generally expects to spend $250 per unit on an annual recurring basis. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Companys total improvements to real estate approximated $150.9 million. Replacements, which include new carpeting, appliances, mechanical equipment, fixtures, vinyl floors and blinds inside the unit approximated $56.0 million, or $276 per unit. Building improvements for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Acquired Properties approximated $26.4 million, or $496 per unit. Building improvements for all of the Companys pre 1999 Acquired Properties approximated $57.2 million or $383 per unit. In addition, approximately $7.2 million was spent on twelve specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. Also included in total improvements to real estate was approximately $4.1 million on commercial/other assets and Partially Owned Properties. Such improvements to real estate were primarily funded from net cash provided by operating activities. Total improvements to real estate for 2002 are estimated at $135.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Companys total non real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, was approximately $6.9 million. Such additions to non real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating activities. Total additions to non real estate property for 2002 are estimated at $6.8 million. The Company has a policy of capitalizing expenditures made for rental furniture and related property and equipment. The Company, prior to the sale of its furniture rental business, purchased furniture to replace furniture that had been sold and to maintain adequate levels of rental furniture to meet existing and new customer needs. Expenditures for property and equipment that significantly enhance the value of existing assets or substantially extend the useful life of an asset are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2001, total additions to rental furniture 41 approximated $18.6 million and property and equipment approximated $2.5 million. The furniture rental business was sold on January 11, 2002. Minority Interests as of December 31, 2001 increased by $23.2 million when compared to December 31, 2000 principally as a result of the consolidation of twenty one former Unconsolidated Properties and the issuance of $60.0 million of Preference Interests, partially offset by the conversions of OP Units into Common Shares. The primary factors that impacted this account in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year were: distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $40.2 million for 2001 (excluding Preference Unit/Interest distributions); the allocation of income from operations in the amount of $32.8 million; the allocation of Minority Interests from Partially Owned Properties in the amount of $2.2 million; the conversion of OP Units into Common Shares; and the issuance of Common Shares, OP Units, Preference Units and Preference Interests during 2001. Total distributions paid in 2001 amounted to $475.8 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared in the fourth quarter of 2001 and paid in 2002. The Company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing Properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit. The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. The Company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain Properties. During March 2002, the Company anticipates the issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of approximately $300.0 million. In addition, the Company has certain unencumbered Properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable to the Company or the cost of alternative sources of capital to the Company is too high. These unencumbered Properties are in excess of the value of unencumbered Properties the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. The Company has a revolving credit facility to provide the Operating Partnership with potential borrowings of up to $700 million. As of February 28, 2002, $262.0 million was outstanding under this facility. This credit Facility is scheduled to expire in August 2002 and the Company has begun the process of replacing its line of credit with a new line of credit, which it believes will be on at least as favorable terms. In connection with the Globe acquisition, the Company assumed a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $55.0 million. This credit facility was terminated on May 31, 2001. In connection with the Wellsford Merger, the Company provided a credit enhancement with respect to certain tax exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project. As of February 28, 2002, this enhancement was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million. 42 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137 and 138), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value. Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria of SFAS No. 133 is marked to market each period. As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the new standard resulted in derivative instruments reported on the balance sheet as liabilities of approximately $6.6 million; an adjustment of approximately $5.3 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which are gains and losses not affecting retained earnings in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity; and a charge of approximately $1.3 million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2001, the Company had entered into swaps which have been designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $626.4 million at interest rates ranging from 3.65% to 6.15% maturing at various dates ranging from 2003 to 2007 with a net liability fair value of $23.3 million; and swaps which have been designated as fair value hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $396.4 million at interest rates ranging from 4.46% to 7.25% maturing at various dates ranging from 2003 to 2011 with a net asset fair value of $4.6 million. At December 31, 2001, the Companys joint venture development partners had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction mortgage loans. The Company has recorded its proportionate share of these qualifying hedges on its consolidated balance sheet. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current aggregate notional amount of $302.5 million (notional amounts range from $139.7 million to $525.1 million over the terms of the swaps) at interest rates ranging from 4.13% to 7.35% maturing at various dates ranging from 2002 to 2005 with a net liability fair value of $10.4 million. As of December 31, 2001, there were approximately $32.6 million in deferred losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. On December 31, 2001, the net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately $18.7 million and as a reduction to investment in unconsolidated entities of approximately $10.4 million. The Company expects to recognize an estimated $14.3 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending December 31, 2002, of which $6.5 million is related to the development joint venture swaps. 43  For the Year Ended December 31, 2000 As of January 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $29.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $400 million available on its lines of credit, of which $65.8 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2000 was approximately $23.8 million and the amount available on the Companys line of credit was $399.5 million, of which $53.5 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). Part of the Companys strategy in funding the purchase of multifamily properties, funding its Properties in the development stage and the funding of the Companys investment in joint ventures is to utilize its line of credit and to subsequently repay the line of credit from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or the net proceeds from the disposition of Properties. Utilizing this strategy during 2000, the Company: obtained mortgage financing on forty six previously unencumbered Properties and received net proceeds of $484.4 million; disposed of fifty three properties (including the sale of the Companys entire interest in three Unconsolidated Properties) and received net proceeds of $631.2 million; sold and or contributed thirty four properties to three separate joint ventures and received net proceeds of $97.0 million; issued approximately 1.8 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $32.9 million; and issued five new series of Preference Interests and received net proceeds of $142.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company: repaid four unsecured note issues totaling $208.0 million; repaid approximately $171.8 million of mortgage indebtedness on eighty three Properties; funded $160.9 million related to the development, earnout, and joint venture agreements; purchased twenty eight Properties (excluding Grove) for a total purchase price of approximately $654.1 million; funded $5.2 million to acquire all third party equity interests in eleven former Unconsolidated Properties; funded $58.5 million related to the purchase of two separate vacant land parcels for future development; funded $1.25 million to acquire an additional ownership interest in 14 former Unconsolidated Properties which, as a result, were reclassified as Partially Owned Properties; and acquired $25.0 million of 8.25% preferred securities of WRP Convertible Trust I, an affiliate of WRP Newco. 44 The Companys total debt summary, as of December 31, 2000, included: Debt Summary as of December 31, 2000 $ Millions Weighted Average Rate Secured $ 3,231 6.91 % Unsecured 2,475 7.07 % Total $ 5,706 6.98 % Fixed Rate $ 4,885 7.13 % Floating Rate 821 6.09 % Total $ 5,706 6.98 % Above Totals Include: Total Tax Exempt $ 966 5.19 % Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility $ 355 7.19 % Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Including Goodwill The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for impairment indicators. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30 year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5 year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments. Stock Based Compensation The Company has chosen to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding market value of the Companys Common Shares on the date of grant, instead of Statement 45 No. 123, which would result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock based compensation issued. Adjusted Net Income For the year ended December 31, 2001, Adjusted Net Income ("ANI") available to Common Shares and OP units decreased $18.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2000, ANI available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $110.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. The following is a reconciliation of net income available to Common Shares to ANI available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Adjusted Net Income (Amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net income available to Common Shares $ 367,466 $ 437,510 $ 280,685 Net income allocation to Minority Interest Operating Partnership 32,829 41,761 29,536 Adjustments: Acquisition cost depreciation* 379,751 364,177 346,497 Amortization of goodwill 3,779 1,760 Acquisition cost depreciation accumulated on sold properties (62,708 ) (110,554 ) (26,935 ) Extraordinary items (444 ) 5,592 451 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,270 ANI available to Common Shares and OP Units basic** $ 721,943 $ 740,246 $ 630,234 *Acquisition cost depreciation represents depreciation for the initial cost of the property, including buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment and depreciation on capital improvements identified in the acquisition underwriting and incurred in the first twenty four months of ownership when the total cost exceeds $2,000 per unit. **Adjusted Net Income represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), including gains or losses from sales of real estate, plus acquisition cost depreciation, plus amortization of goodwill, minus the accumulated acquisition cost depreciation on sold properties, plus/minus extraordinary items and plus the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Depreciation associated with replacements and capital improvements is deducted in calculating ANI. The Company believes that ANI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. ANI in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Companys performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. The Companys calculation of ANI may differ from the methodology for calculating ANI utilized by other real estate companies and may differ, for example, due to variations among the Companys and other real estate companies accounting policies for replacement type items and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. 46 Funds From Operations For the year ended December 31, 2001, Funds From Operations ("FFO") available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $60.5 million, or 8.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2000, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $106.6 million, or 17.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. The following is a reconciliation of net income available to Common Shares to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Funds From Operations (Amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net income available to Common Shares $ 367,466 $ 437,510 $ 280,685 Net income allocation to Minority Interest Operating Partnership 32,829 41,761 29,536 Adjustments: Depreciation/amortization* 463,125 438,735 402,466 Net gain on sales of real estate (149,293 ) (198,426 ) (93,535 ) Extraordinary items (444 ) 5,592 451 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,270 Impairment on furniture rental business 60,000 Impairment on technology investments 11,766 1,000 FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units basic $ 786,719 $ 726,172 $ 619,603 *Includes $13,022, $2,720 and $1,009 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, related to the Companys share of depreciation from Unconsolidated Properties. Excludes $4,353 and $1,476 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to the minority interests share of depreciation from Partially Owned Properties. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (("GAAP")), excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization (after adjustments for Partially Owned Properties and Unconsolidated Properties), plus/minus extraordinary items, and plus the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and impairment charges. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Companys performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in short term LIBOR interest rates. The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys unsecured line of credit. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair values of the Companys financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The fair value of the Companys mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at December 31, 2001. The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $896.0 million, or 15.6% of the Companys total debt at December 31, 2001, including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements. If market rates of interest on all of the Companys floating rate debt permanently increased by 32 basis points (a 10% increase), the increase in interest expense on the Companys floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.9 million. If market rates of interest on all of the Companys floating rate debt permanently decreased by 32 basis points (a 10% decrease), the decrease in interest expense on the Companys floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.9 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Companys floating rate debt and does not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Companys financial structure or results other than interest expense. The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate, long term debt will be available to the Company at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.
