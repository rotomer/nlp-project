Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Companys ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2002. Forward looking statements in this Item 7 as well as Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words believes, estimates, expects and anticipates and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters identify forward looking statements.

Results of Operations The following table summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods presented: Properties Units Purchase / Sale Price $ Millions At December 31, 2000 1,104 227,704 2001 Acquisitions 14 3,423 $ 388.1 2001 Dispositions (49 ) (8,807 ) $ 416.9 2001 Completed Developments 7 2,505 Unit Configuration Changes (24 ) At December 31, 2001 1,076 224,801 2002 Acquisitions 12 3,634 $ 289.9 Ft.

Significant changes in revenues and expenses have resulted primarily from the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties in July 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002, the disposition of the furniture rental business on January 11, 2002, reduced rental income through increased concessions or reduced apartment rents and occupancy at many of our properties and the properties acquired and developments completed in 2001 and 2002, which have been partially offset by the properties disposed in 2001 and 2002. Significant changes in expenses have also resulted from changes in insurance costs, general and administrative costs, impairment charges and variable interest rates. This impact is discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2002 and 2001 (the 2002 Same Store Properties), which represented 188,027 units, impacted the Companys results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2001 and 2000 (the 2001 Same Store Properties), which represented 181,951 units, also impacted the Companys results of operations. Both the 2002 Same Store Properties and 2001 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2001 For the year ended December 31, 2002, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately $64.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues from the 2002 Same Store Properties decreased primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents. Property operating expenses from the 2002 Same Store Properties, which include property and maintenance, 35 real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, remained relatively stable with increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs offset by a decrease in utility costs. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, net operating income (NOI) and weighted average occupancy for the 2002 Same Store Properties: 2002 Same Store Properties Year over Year Same Store Results $ in Millions 188,027 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses NOI 2002 $ 1,768.0 $ 663.3 $ 1,104.7 2001 $ 1,815.9 $ 658.3 $ 1,157.6 Change $ (47.9 ) $ 5.0 $ (52.9 ) Change (2.6 )% 0.8 % (4.6 )% Same Store Occupancy Statistics Year 2002 93.5 % Year 2001 94.5 % Change (1.0 )% For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2002 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2003, the Company anticipates the following operating results for the full year ending December 31, 2003: 2003 Same Store Operating Assumptions Physical Occupancy 93.0% Revenue Change (3.9)% to (1.4)% Expense Change 2.1% to 4.4% NOI Change (9.2)% to (3.7)% Dispositions $700 million These 2003 operating assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward looking. Rental income from properties other than 2002 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $15.9 million primarily as a result of revenue from properties acquired in 2001 and 2002 and additional Partially Owned Properties consolidated in 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002. Interest and other income decreased by approximately $7.0 million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on short term investment accounts along with lower balances on deposit in tax deferred exchange accounts. Interest income investment in mortgage notes decreased by $8.8 million as a result of the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties in July 2001. No additional interest income will be recognized on such mortgage notes in future years as the Company now consolidates the results related to these previously Unconsolidated Properties. See Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Property management expenses include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties. These expenses decreased by approximately $5.0 million or 6.5%. This decrease is 36 primarily attributable to lower amounts accrued for employee bonuses and profit sharing for 2002 and lower headcount in 2002. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $1.6 million as a result of managing additional units at Fort Lewis, Washington starting in April 2002. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company managed 18,965 units and 16,539 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities. The Company recorded impairment charges in 2002 on its corporate housing business and its technology investments of approximately $17.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. See Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $15.5 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $27.2 million as compared to $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 6.54% as compared to 6.89% for the year ended December 31, 2001. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $11.1 million between the years under comparison. This increase was primarily due to retirement plan expenses for certain key executives, restricted shares/awards granted to key employees, additional compensation charges and costs associated with the Companys new President, higher state income taxes in Michigan and New Jersey and income taxes incurred by one of the Companys taxable REIT subsidiaries which has an ownership interest in properties that in prior periods were classified as Unconsolidated Properties. Income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $7.5 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of increased equity losses and unrealized losses on derivative instruments. Net gain on sales of discontinued operations decreased approximately $44.6 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of the properties sold in 2001 having a lower net carrying value at sale, which resulted in higher gain recognition for financial reporting purposes. Discontinued operations, net, increased approximately $53.0 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily attributable to a one time $60.0 million impairment on the furniture rental business in 2001, which was subsequently sold in January 2002. See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31, 2000 For the year ended December 31, 2001, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased by approximately $32.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Revenues from the 2001 Same Store Properties increased primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged new residents and resident renewals and an increase in income from billing residents for their share of utility costs as well as other ancillary services provided to residents. Property operating expenses from the 2001 Same Store Properties, which include property and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, increased primarily attributable to a $5.4 million, or 5.6%, increase in utilities and an $8.2 million, or 5.5%, increase in payroll costs. The following tables provide 37 comparative revenue, expense, net operating income and weighted average occupancy for the 2001 Same Store Properties: 2001 Same Store Properties Year over Year Same Store Results $ in Millions 181,951 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses NOI 2001 $ 1,721.2 $ 626.4 $ 1,094.8 2000 $ 1,658.7 $ 604.1 $ 1,054.6 Change $ 62.5 $ 22.3 $ 40.2 Change 3.8 % 3.7 % 3.8 % Same Store Occupancy Statistics Year 2001 94.4 % Year 2000 94.9 % Change (0.5 )% Rental income from properties other than 2001 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $54.6 million primarily as a result of revenue from 2001 and 2000 Acquired Properties, additional 2001 Partially Owned Properties, and the 2001 Disposition Properties. Interest and other income decreased by approximately $3.4 million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on short term investment accounts. Interest income investment in mortgage notes decreased by approximately $2.4 million as a result of the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties in July 2001. See Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Property management expenses include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys Properties. These expenses increased by approximately $0.7 million or less than 1%. The Company continued to acquire properties in major metropolitan areas and dispose of assets in smaller multi family rental markets where the Company did not have a significant management presence. As a result, the Company was able to maintain off site management expenses at a constant level between the two reporting periods. Fee and asset management revenues and fee and asset management expenses increased as a result of the Company continuing to manage properties that were sold and or contributed to various unconsolidated joint venture entities. As of December 31, 2001, the Company managed 16,539 units for third parties and unconsolidated entities. Impairment on technology investments increased approximately $10.8 million between the years under comparison. See Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $10.6 million. During 2001, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $28.2 million as compared to $17.7 million for the year ended 2000. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 6.89% as compared to 7.25% for the year ended December 31, 2000. 38 General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $9.0 million between the years under comparison. This increase was primarily due to the addition of corporate personnel, recruiting fees for the new President, retirement plan expenses for certain key executives, and higher overall compensation expenses including a current year expense associated with the vesting of restricted shares/awards to key employees earned over the past three years. Income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $1.5 million between the periods under comparison primarily as a result of an increase in the number of completed unconsolidated development projects. Net gain on sales of discontinued operations decreased approximately $49.5 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of approximately 8,800 fewer units sold during the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Discontinued operations, net, decreased approximately $71.8 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily attributable to a one time $60.0 million impairment on the furniture rental business in 2001. See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 As of January 1, 2002, the Company had approximately $51.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $446.0 million available under its line of credit (net of $59.0 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2002 was approximately $29.9 million and the amount available on the Companys line of credit was $499.2 million (net of $60.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). Part of the Companys acquisition and development funding strategy and the funding of investments in various unconsolidated entities is to utilize its line of credit and to subsequently repay the line of credit from the disposition of properties, retained cash flows or the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. Continuing to utilize this strategy during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company: disposed of fifty eight properties (including six Unconsolidated Properties) and received net proceeds of approximately $528.5 million; disposed of the furniture rental business on January 11, 2002 and received net proceeds of approximately $28.7 million; issued $400.0 million of 6.625% fixed rate unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $394.5 million; issued $50.0 million of 4.861% fixed rate unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $49.9 million; issued approximately 1.8 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $39.0 million; and obtained $126.1 million in new mortgage financing. All of these proceeds were utilized to: purchase additional properties; repay the line of credit; repay mortgage indebtedness on selected properties; repay public unsecured debt; repurchase and retire Common Shares; 39 invest in consolidated and unconsolidated development projects; and invest in unconsolidated entities. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company: acquired twelve properties utilizing cash of $258.3 million; repaid $55.0 million on its line of credit; repaid $407.7 million of mortgage loans; repaid $100.0 million of 9.375% fixed rate public notes at maturity; repaid $125.0 million of 7.95% fixed rate public notes at maturity; repaid $40.0 million of 7.25% fixed rate public notes at maturity; repaid $4.7 million of other unsecured notes; repurchased and retired approximately 5.1 million of its Common Shares for approximately $115.0 million; funded a net of $62.8 million under its development agreements; and funded $10.0 million in connection with its agreement with the U.S. Army for Fort Lewis military housing. Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase up to an additional $85.0 million of its Common Shares pursuant to the common share buyback program authorized by its Board of Trustees. The Companys total debt summary and debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2002, are as follows: Debt Summary as of December 31, 2002 $ Millions Weighted Average Rate Secured $ 2,928 6.15 % Unsecured 2,596 6.30 % Total $ 5,524 6.22 % Fixed Rate* $ 4,776 6.83 % Floating Rate* 748 2.33 % Total* $ 5,524 6.22 % Above Totals Include: Total Tax Exempt $ 985 3.75 % Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility $ 140 1.98 % * Net of the effect of any interest rate protection agreements. 40 Debt Maturity Schedule as of December 31, 2002 Year $ Millions % of Total 2003 $ 334 6.1 % 2004 605 11.0 % 2005* 818 14.8 % 2006 460 8.3 % 2007 316 5.7 % 2008 457 8.3 % 2009 277 5.0 % 2010 256 4.6 % 2011 654 11.8 % 2012+ 1,347 24.4 % Total $ 5,524 100.0 % * Includes $300 million with a final maturity of 2015 that is putable/callable in 2005 and $140 million related to the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility. The Companys Consolidated Debt to Total Market Capitalization Ratio as of December 31, 2002 is presented in the following table. The Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Companys Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the Common Share Equivalent of all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and preference interests outstanding.

From January 1, 2003 through February 3, 2003, the Company: acquired one property consisting of 226 units for approximately $41.0 million; disposed of five properties consisting of 1,011 units for approximately $57.4 million; refinanced the mortgage debt on eleven Partially Owned Properties and received additional cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 million; and repaid $44.9 million of mortgage debt at/or prior to maturity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2002, the Company has 18 projects in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2004. The three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms: the first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value. If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value. The Companys partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property. The Company has an obligation to fund up to an additional $13.0 million to guarantee third party construction financing, if required. the second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to require the Company to purchase the partners interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price. If the Company and the partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals. If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value. The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed upon value to an unrelated third party. Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, any projects 42 remaining unsold must be purchased by the Company at the agreed upon price. the third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization (generally defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months following the substantial completion of a project) to market a project for sale. Thereafter, either the Company or its development partner may market a project for sale. If the Companys development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project. If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property. Once a value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed upon value. In connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a credit enhancement with respect to certain tax exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project. As of February 3, 2003, this enhancement was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million. As of February 2003, the Company has a commitment to fund $6.1 million to Constellation Real Technologies, LLC, a real estate technology company. See also Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys investments in unconsolidated entities. Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate: Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories: Replacements (inside the unit). These include: carpets and hardwood floors; appliances; mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc; furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; flooring such as vinyl, linoleum or tile; and blinds/shades We typically capitalize for established properties approximately $260 to $290 per unit annually for inside the unit replacements. All replacements are depreciated over a five year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above. Building improvements (outside the unit). These include: roof replacement and major repairs; paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks; amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices; major building mechanical equipment systems; interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding; major landscaping and grounds improvement; and vehicles and office and maintenance equipment. We typically capitalize for established properties approximately $380 to $390 per unit annually for 43 outside the unit building improvements. All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all recurring expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life. For the year ended December 31, 2002, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $156.8 million. This includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts): Capitalized Improvements to Real Estate For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Units (1) Replacements (2) Avg.

(3) Building improvements include roof replacement, paving, amenities and common areas, building 44 mechanical equipment systems, exterior painting and siding, major landscaping, vehicles and office and maintenance equipment. (4) Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 1999. (5) Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 1999, 2000 and 2001. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 48,434 units. (6) Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions, and $7.2 million included in building improvements spent on twelve specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. We anticipate to capitalize annually an average of approximately $640 to $680 per unit for inside and outside the unit capital expenditures to our established properties. The Company expects to fund approximately $150.0 million for capital expenditures for replacements and building improvements in 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys total non real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, was approximately $7.3 million. The Company expects to fund approximately $4.9 million in total additions to non real estate property for 2003. Improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property for both 2002 and 2001 were funded from net cash provided by operating activities. Derivative Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives. The following table summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2002 (dollar amounts are in thousands): Cash Flow Hedges Fair Value Hedges Forward Starting Swaps Offsetting Receive Floating Swaps/Caps Offsetting Pay Floating Swaps/Caps Current Notional Balance $ 400,000 $ 120,000 $ 250,000 $ 255,118 $ 255,118 Lowest Possible Notional $ 400,000 $ 120,000 $ 250,000 $ 251,410 $ 251,410 Highest Possible Notional $ 400,000 $ 120,000 $ 250,000 $ 431,444 $ 431,444 Lowest Interest Rate 3.65125 % 7.25000 % 5.06375 % 4.52800 % 4.45800 % Highest Interest Rate 5.81000 % 7.25000 % 5.42600 % 6.00000 % 6.00000 % Earliest Maturity Date 2003 2005 2013 2003 2003 Latest Maturity Date 2005 2005 2013 2007 2007 Estimated Asset (Liability) Fair Value $ (14,438 ) $ 9,069 $ (11,077 ) $ (3,148 ) $ 3,025 At December 31, 2002, certain unconsolidated development partnerships in which the Company invested had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction mortgage loans. The Company has recorded its proportionate share of these hedges on its consolidated balance sheets. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current aggregate notional amount of $446.6 million (notional amounts range from $169.2 million to $555.9 million over the terms of the swaps) at interest rates ranging from 2.115% to 6.94% maturing at various 45 dates ranging from 2003 to 2005 with a net liability fair value of $13.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of $1.1 million due to ineffectiveness of certain of these unconsolidated development derivatives (included in income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities). On December 31, 2002, the net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately $16.6 million and as a reduction to investments in unconsolidated entities of approximately $13.9 million. As of December 31, 2002, there were approximately $42.8 million in deferred losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31, 2002, the Company may recognize an estimated $17.7 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending December 31, 2003, of which $7.9 million is related to the unconsolidated development partnerships. Other Minority Interests as of December 31, 2002 decreased by $24.5 million when compared to December 31, 2001. The primary factors that impacted this account in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year were: distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $39.1 million for 2002 (excluding Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions); the allocation of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $26.9 million; the allocation of income from operations to Partially Owned Properties in the amount of $1.9 million; the conversion of OP Units into Common Shares; and the issuance of Common Shares and OP Units during 2002. Total distributions paid in January 2003 amounted to $143.1 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared in the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit. The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. The Company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties. In addition, the Company has certain unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of these unencumbered properties are in excess of the required value the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. On May 30, 2002, the Company obtained a new three year $700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The new line of credit replaced the $700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2002. The prior existing revolving credit facility was terminated upon the closing of the new facility. This new facility matures in May 2005 and will be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements. As of February 3, 2003, $218.0 million was outstanding under this new facility. For the Year Ended December 31, 2001 As of January 1, 2001, the Company had approximately $23.8 million of cash and cash equivalents 46 and $399.5 million available under its lines of credit, of which $53.5 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2001 was approximately $51.6 million and the amount available on the Companys line of credit was $505.0 million, of which $59.0 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). Part of the Companys acquisition and development funding strategy and the funding of investments in various unconsolidated entities is to utilize its lines of credit and to subsequently repay the line of credit from the disposition of properties, retained cash flows or the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. Continuing to utilize this strategy during the year ended 2001, the Company: disposed of forty nine properties (including two Unconsolidated Properties) and two vacant parcels of land and received net proceeds of $399.1 million; issued $300.0 million of 6.95% fixed rate unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $297.4 million; sold and or contributed eleven properties to a joint venture and received net proceeds of $167.6 million; issued approximately 3.6 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $74.4 million; issued $60.0 million of four new series of Preference Interests and received net proceeds of $58.5 million; obtained $91.6 million in new mortgage financing; and received $61.4 million of principal repayments on its investment in second and third mortgages on previously Unconsolidated Properties. All of these proceeds were utilized to either: purchase additional properties; repay the lines of credit; redeem the Companys Series A and F Preferred Shares; repay mortgage indebtedness on selected properties; repay public unsecured debt; and invest in unconsolidated entities. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company: acquired fourteen properties and vacant land utilizing cash of $297.8 million; repaid $160.5 million on its line of credit; funded $210.5 million to redeem all of its Series A and F Preferred Shares; repaid $364.2 million of mortgages loans; and funded a net of $174.6 million under its development agreements. The Companys total debt summary, as of December 31, 2001, included: 47 Debt Summary as of December 31, 2001 $ Millions Weighted Average Rate Secured $ 3,287 6.51 % Unsecured 2,456 6.32 % Total $ 5,743 6.43 % Fixed Rate* $ 4,847 7.02 % Floating Rate* 896 3.20 % Total* $ 5,743 6.43 % Above Totals Include: Total Tax Exempt $ 975 4.41 % Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility $ 195 2.50 % *Net of the effect of any interest rate protection agreements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The six critical accounting policies are: Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Including Goodwill The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for impairment indicators. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30 year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5 year to 10 year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5 year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations. Cost Capitalization See the Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to building. 48 The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties, except for costs that are incurred during the initial lease up phase on a development project. An allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved. Stabilized occupancy is always deemed to have occurred no later than one year from cessation of major development activities. The incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities. The Company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137 and 138) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments. Revenue Recognition Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight line basis. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. The Company adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition, effective October 1, 2000. SAB No. 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Stock Option Compensation The Company has chosen to account for its stock option compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Companys Common Shares on the date of grant. The Company will elect to expense its stock option compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148) effective in the first quarter of 2003, which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock option compensation issued. Funds From Operations For the year ended December 31, 2002, Funds From Operations (FFO) available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased $48.4 million, or 6.1%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $60.5 million, or 8.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000: The following is a reconciliation of net income available to Common Shares to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: 49 Funds From Operations (Amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net income available to Common Shares $ 324,162 $ 367,466 $ 437,510 Net income allocation to Minority Interests Operating Partnership 26,862 32,829 41,761 Adjustments: Depreciation 462,341 439,565 427,799 Depreciation Non real estate additions (9,213 ) (6,555 ) (6,716 ) Depreciation Partially Owned Properties (7,706 ) (4,353 ) (1,476 ) Depreciation Unconsolidated Properties 19,872 13,022 2,720 Amortization of goodwill 2,356 Extraordinary items 792 (444 ) 5,592 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,270 Impairment on corporate housing business 17,122 Impairment on technology investments 1,162 11,766 1,000 Net gain on sales of condominium units to third parties 1,682 Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities (5,054 ) (387 ) Discontinued Operations: Depreciation 10,616 17,667 16,408 Amortization of goodwill 1,423 Impairment on furniture rental business 60,000 Net gain on sales (104,296 ) (148,906 ) (198,426 ) FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units basic(1) $ 738,342 $ 786,719 $ 726,172 (1) FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)), plus depreciation (after adjustments for non real estate additions, Partially Owned Properties and Unconsolidated Properties), plus amortization of goodwill and plus/minus extraordinary items, the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and impairment charges. Adjustments also include net gain on sales of condominium units to third parties and net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities and for discontinued operations related to depreciation, goodwill amortization, impairment on furniture rental business and net gain on sales. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Companys performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. The Companys calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other real estate companies and may differ, for example, due to variations among the Companys and other real estate companies accounting policies for replacement type items and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in short term LIBOR interest rates. The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing. The 50 Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also Note 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments. The fair values of the Companys financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The fair value of the Companys mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at December 31, 2002. The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $748.0 million, or 13.5% of total debt at December 31, 2002, including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 23 basis points (a 10% increase), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.7 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 23 basis points (a 10% decrease), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.7 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Companys floating rate debt and does not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Companys financial structure or results other than interest expense. The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate, long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.
