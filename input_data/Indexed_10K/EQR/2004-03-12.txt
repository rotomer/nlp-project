Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Companys ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.

Results of Operations The following table summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods presented: Properties Units Purchase / Sale Price $ Millions At December 31, 2001 1,076 224,801 2002 Acquisitions 12 3,634 $ 289.9 Ft.

Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2002 and 2001 (the 2002 Same Store Properties), which represented 188,027 units, also impacted the Companys results of operations. Both the 2003 Same Store Properties and 2002 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs. The Companys acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002 For the year ended December 31, 2003, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately $23.1 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenues from the 2003 Same Store Properties decreased primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents. Property operating expenses from the 2003 Same Store Properties increased primarily due to higher payroll, maintenance, utility, real estate taxes, insurance, leasing and advertising and building costs. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, net operating income (NOI) and weighted average occupancy for the 2003 Same Store Properties (NOI represents rental income less: property and maintenance expense; real estate taxes and insurance expense; and property management expense): 32 2003 vs. 2002 Year over Year Same Store Results $ in Millions 171,841 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses NOI 2003 $ 1,650.8 $ 659.0 $ 991.8 2002 $ 1,689.0 $ 622.7 $ 1,066.3 Change $ (38.2 ) $ 36.3 $ (74.5 ) Change (2.3 )% 5.8 % (7.0 )% Same Store Occupancy Statistics Year 2003 93.0 % Year 2002 93.7 % Change (0.7 %) The Companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is NOI. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Companys apartment communities. For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2003 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2004, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2004: 2004 Same Store Assumptions Physical Occupancy 93.0% Revenue Change (0.75%) to 1.50% Expense Change 3.0% to 4.0% NOI Change (4.0%) to 0.5% Acquisitions $800 million Dispositions $800 million These 2004 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward looking. Rental income from properties other than 2003 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $47.5 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2003 Same Store Properties and additional Partially Owned Properties consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $4.9 million primarily as a result of additional income allocated from Ft. Lewis. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company managed 18,475 units and 18,965 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities. Property management expenses include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased by approximately $4.4 million or 6.0%. This decrease is primarily attributable to a reversal of a profit sharing accrual in the first quarter of 2003 related to the 2002 calendar year as the Company didnt achieve its stated goals and management elected not to make a discretionary contribution to the plan. In addition, the Company recorded lower expense in connection with granting less restricted 33 shares and reducing the expense associated with the Companys matched funding of its 401(k) plan during 2003 and not incurring an expense for 2003 discretionary profit sharing contributions. Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased $25.3 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after December 31, 2002, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $7.7 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease was primarily due to lower expenses recorded in connection with granting less restricted shares to employees during 2003, partially offset by approximately a $2.6 million increase related to the Companys decision to begin to expense its stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148). In addition, lower state income and franchise taxes also contributed to this decrease. The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing business of approximately $1.2 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income increased by approximately $1.4 million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances available for short term investments throughout 2003. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $6.1 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $20.6 million as compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 6.36% as compared to 6.54% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $6.4 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of increased operating losses from equity investments partially offset by unrealized gains on derivative instruments. Net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately $206.4 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of a greater number of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2003, as well as the fact that several properties had lower net carrying values at sale. Discontinued operations, net, decreased approximately $48.6 million between the periods under comparison. See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2001 For the year ended December 31, 2002, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately $61.0 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues from the 2002 Same Store Properties decreased primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents. Property operating expenses from the 2002 Same Store Properties, which include property and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, remained relatively stable with increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs offset by a decrease in utility costs. 34 The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for the 2002 Same Store Properties: 2002 vs. 2001 Year over Year Same Store Results $ in Millions 188,027 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses NOI 2002 $ 1,768.0 $ 663.3 $ 1,104.7 2001 $ 1,815.9 $ 658.3 $ 1,157.6 Change $ (47.9 ) $ 5.0 $ (52.9 ) Change (2.6 )% 0.8 % (4.6 )% Same Store Occupancy Statistics Year 2002 93.5 % Year 2001 94.5 % Change (1.0 %) Rental income from properties other than 2002 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $19.8 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2002 Same Store Properties. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $1.5 million as a result of managing additional units at Fort Lewis, Washington starting in April 2002. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company managed 18,965 units and 16,539 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities. Property management expenses include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties. These expenses decreased by approximately $4.6 million or 5.9%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower amounts accrued for employee bonuses and profit sharing for 2002 and lower headcount in 2002. Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased $22.3 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after December 31, 2001, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $11.1 million between the years under comparison. This increase was primarily due to retirement plan expenses for certain key executives, restricted shares/awards granted to key employees, additional compensation charges and costs associated with the Companys new President, higher state income taxes in Michigan and New Jersey and income taxes incurred by one of the Companys taxable REIT subsidiaries which has an ownership interest in properties that in prior periods were classified as Unconsolidated Properties. The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing business of approximately $18.3 million and $11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 35 Interest and other income decreased by approximately $6.7 million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on short term investment accounts along with lower balances on deposit in tax deferred exchange accounts. Interest income investment in mortgage notes decreased by $8.8 million as a result of the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties in July 2001. No additional interest income will be recognized on such mortgage notes in future years as the Company now consolidates the results related to these previously Unconsolidated Properties. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $11.0 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $27.2 million as compared to $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 6.54% as compared to 6.89% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $7.5 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of increased equity losses and unrealized losses on derivative instruments. Net gain on sales of discontinued operations decreased approximately $44.6 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of the properties sold in 2001 having a lower net carrying value at sale, which resulted in higher gain recognition for financial reporting purposes. Discontinued operations, net, increased approximately $48.5 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily attributable to a one time $60.0 million impairment on the furniture rental business in 2001, which was subsequently sold in January 2002. See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 As of January 1, 2003, the Company had approximately $29.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $499.2 million available under its line of credit (net of $60.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2003 was approximately $49.6 million and the amount available on the Companys line of credit was $633.3 million (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following: Disposed of ninety six properties (including two Unconsolidated Properties) and received net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion; Issued $400.0 million of 5.20% fixed rate unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $397.5 million; Issued $150.0 million of 6.48% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and received net proceeds of $145.3 million; Obtained $111.2 million in new mortgage financing; and Issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $74.7 million. 36 During the year ended December 31, 2003, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to: Acquire seventeen properties, and two additional units at an existing property, utilizing cash of $595.1 million; Pay Common Share and OP Unit dividends of $510.7 million ($1.73 per share); Pay preferred share and preference interest/unit dividends of $99.9 million; Repay $432.9 million of mortgage loans; Repay $130.0 million on its line of credit; Repay $100.0 million of floating rate public notes at maturity; Repay $50.0 million and $40.0 million of 6.65% and 6.875%, respectively, fixed rate public notes at maturity; Repay $4.5 million of other unsecured notes; Redeem $295.3 million of 7.25% Series G Convertible Cumulative Preferred Shares which included a cash redemption premium of $8.3 million; and Redeem $100.0 million of 7.625% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at liquidation value; Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase up to an additional $85.0 million of its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share buyback program authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Company did not repurchase any of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2003. The Companys total debt summary and debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2003, are as follows: Debt Summary $ Millions * Weighted Average Rate * Secured $ 2,694 5.80 % Unsecured 2,666 6.38 % Total $ 5,360 6.08 % Fixed Rate $ 4,610 6.65 % Floating Rate 750 2.24 % Total $ 5,360 6.08 % Above Totals Include: Tax Exempt Fixed $ 343 4.38 % Floating 587 1.74 % Total $ 930 3.01 % Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility $ 10 1.85 % * Net of the effect of any derivative instruments. 37 Debt Maturity Schedule Year $ Millions % of Total 2004 $ 515 9.6 % 2005 (1) 605 11.3 % 2006 (2) 490 9.1 % 2007 333 6.2 % 2008 495 9.2 % 2009 246 4.6 % 2010 196 3.7 % 2011 688 12.8 % 2012 424 7.9 % 2013+ 1,368 25.6 % Total $ 5,360 100.0 % (1) Includes $300 million of unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2015 that is putable/callable in 2005.

In June 2003, the Operating Partnership filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S 3 registration statement to register $2.0 billion of debt securities. In addition, the Operating Partnership carried over $280.0 million related to a prior registration statement. As of February 4, 2004, $2.28 billion in debt securities remained available for issuance under this registration statement. The Companys Consolidated Debt to Total Market Capitalization Ratio as of December 31, 2003 is presented in the following table. The Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Companys Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the Common Share Equivalent of all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and preference interests outstanding.

From January 1, 2004 through February 4, 2004, the Company: Acquired four properties (including two additional units at an existing property) consisting of 1,130 units for approximately $151.3 million; Assumed $36.9 million of mortgage debt on one property in connection with its acquisition; Disposed of twelve properties (including one Unconsolidated Property) and various individual condominium units consisting of 2,972 units for approximately $140.9 million; Obtained $16.5 million in new mortgage financing; and Repaid $50.0 million of mortgage loans. Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories: Replacements (inside the unit). These include: carpets and hardwood floors; appliances; mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc; furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; flooring such as vinyl, linoleum or tile; and blinds/shades. All replacements are depreciated over a five year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above. 39 Building improvements (outside the unit). These include: roof replacement and major repairs; paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks; amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices; major building mechanical equipment systems; interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding; major landscaping and grounds improvement; and vehicles and office and maintenance equipment. All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all recurring expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life. For the year ended December 31, 2003, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $181.9 million. This includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts): Capitalized Improvements to Real Estate For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Units (1) Replacements Avg.

(4) Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.5 million included in building improvements spent on seven specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. For the year ended December 31, 2002, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $156.8 million.

(4) Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $9.1 million included in building improvements spent on six specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. The Company expects to fund approximately $160.0million for capital expenditures for replacements and building improvements for all consolidated properties in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Companys total non real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, was approximately $2.9 million. The Company expects to fund approximately $6.5 million in total additions to non real estate property in 2004. Improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating activities. Derivative Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives. See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2003. 41 Other Minority Interests as of December 31, 2003 decreased by $10.4 million when compared to December 31, 2002. The primary factors that impacted this account in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31, 2003 were: Distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $38.2 million (excluding Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions); The allocation of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $34.7 million; The issuance of 313,720 OP Units to various limited partners at an average price of $26.11 per unit; The issuance of Common Shares; and The conversion of OP Units into Common Shares. Total distributions paid in January 2004 amounted to $141.9 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003. The Company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit. The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. The Company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. The Company has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $700.0 million. This facility matures in May 2005 and may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements. As of March 1, 2004, $255.0 million was outstanding under this facility (and $56.7 was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has co invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Companys liquidity, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities generally, except to the extent the development ventures mitigate risk by deploying the skill and expertise of locally based real estate developers. The nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows: Institutional Ventures During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures. The Companys joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Companys strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets. Development Ventures Since 1998, the Company has generally engaged in development activities through various joint ventures with third party developers. The Company uses the local expertise of these developers and lowers the overall risks 42 associated with development by grouping various development properties into aggregate pools. The Company generally contributes between 25% and 35% of the development cost of these projects with the remaining cost financed through third party construction mortgages. Voting rights are shared equally between the Company and its respective development partners. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has 13 projects in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2005. The three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms: The first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value. If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value. The Companys partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property. In connection with this development agreement, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing. As of February 4, 2004, the Company had set aside $20.0 million towards this credit enhancement. The Company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement. This agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018. Notwithstanding the termination of the agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred. The second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to require the Company to purchase the partners interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price. If the Company and the partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals. If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value. The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed upon value to an unrelated third party. Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed upon price, any projects remaining unsold. The third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization (generally defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months following the substantial completion of a project) to market a project for sale. Thereafter, either the Company or its development partner may market a project for sale. If the Companys development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project. If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property. Once a value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed upon value. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys investments in unconsolidated entities. In connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily 43 development project. The Company has the obligation to provide this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger or through May 2005. The Company would be required to perform under this guaranty only if there was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party. The counterparty has also indemnified the Company for any losses suffered. As of February 4, 2004, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million and no current outstanding liability. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2003: Payments Due by Year (in thousands) Contractual Obligations 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 514,591 $ 605,438 $ 489,961 $ 332,583 $ 494,727 $ 2,923,189 $ 5,360,489 Operating Leases: Minimum Rent Payments (b) 4,835 3,915 2,852 2,376 2,243 8,365 24,586 Other Long Term Liabilities: Deferred Compensation (c) 831 1,376 1,411 2,215 2,270 20,972 29,075 Other (d) 1,000 1,000 Total $ 521,257 $ 610,729 $ 494,224 $ 337,174 $ 499,240 $ 2,952,526 $ 5,415,150 (a) Amounts include aggregate principal payments only. The Company paid $352,391, $365,782 and $380,745 for interest on debt, inclusive of derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The six critical accounting policies are: Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Including Goodwill The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected 44 holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30 year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5 year to 10 year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5 year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations. Cost Capitalization See the Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property. The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties, except for costs that are incurred during the initial lease up phase on a development project. An allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved. The incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities. The Company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments. Revenue Recognition Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight line basis. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Stock Based Compensation Prior to 2003, the Company had chosen to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which resulted in no 45 compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Companys Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method). The Company has elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted. SFAS No. 148 provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company has chosen to use the Prospective Method. This method requires that companies apply the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to only employee awards granted or modified after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied, or January 1, 2003. Compensation expense under all of the Companys plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years. Therefore, the cost related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards. Funds From Operations For the year ended December 31, 2003, Funds From Operations (FFO) available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased $78.9 million, or 11.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $13.0 million, or 1.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: Funds From Operations (Amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net income $ 543,847 $ 421,313 $ 474,023 Net income allocation to Minority Interests Operating Partnership 34,658 26,862 32,391 Adjustments: Depreciation 444,339 419,039 396,737 Depreciation Non real estate additions (7,019 ) (9,213 ) (6,555 ) Depreciation Partially Owned Properties (8,390 ) (7,706 ) (4,353 ) Depreciation Unconsolidated Properties 28,301 19,872 13,022 Net (gain) on sales of unconsolidated entities (4,942 ) (5,054 ) (387 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,270 Discontinued Operations: Depreciation 27,230 53,917 60,495 Net gain on sales of depreciable property (300,426 ) (102,614 ) (148,906 ) FFO (1)(2) 757,598 816,416 817,737 Preferred distributions (96,971 ) (97,151 ) (106,119 ) Premium on redemption of preferred shares (20,237 ) (5,324 ) FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units $ 640,390 $ 719,265 $ 706,294 46 (1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines funds from operations (FFO) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. Accordingly, the Company included in FFO its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties, which represented net gains of $10,280, $1,682 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREITs definition. As a result, FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 have been reduced by $18,284, $71,766 and $1,000, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation. For the year ended December 31, 2001, FFO has been reduced by $5,324 to reflect the SECs clarification of EITF Topic D 42 regarding premiums on redemption of preferred shares. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Companys calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in short term LIBOR interest rates. The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also Note 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments. The fair values of the Companys financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The fair value of the 47 Companys mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at December 31, 2003. The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $750.0 million, or 14.0% of total debt at December 31, 2003, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 22 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.7 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 22 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.7 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $4.6 billion, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 67 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $4.2 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 67 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $5.1 billion. At December 31, 2003, the Companys consolidated derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately $3.9 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 25 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the Companys consolidated derivative instruments would be approximately $8.0 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 25 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys consolidated derivative instruments would be approximately $0.1 million. At December 31, 2003, the Companys unconsolidated derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $5.2 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 11 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys unconsolidated derivative instruments would be approximately $5.1 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 11 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys unconsolidated derivative instruments would be approximately $5.3 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Companys debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Companys financial structure or results. The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.
