Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.

The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Companys apartment communities. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2004 and 2003 (the 2004 Same Store Properties), which represented 162,201 units, impacted the Companys results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2003 and 2002 (the 2003 Same Store Properties), which represented 171,841 units, also impacted the Companys results of operations. Both the 2004 Same Store Properties and 2003 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs. The Companys acquisition, disposition, completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003 For the year ended December 31, 2004, income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $22.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of $15.2 million in estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its properties primarily located in Florida caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. Of this amount, approximately $9.4 million had been spent for hurricane related repairs through December 31, 2004. 34 Revenues from the 2004 Same Store Properties increased $14.1 million primarily as a result of lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in occupancy rates. Expenses from the 2004 Same Store Properties increased $22.5 million primarily due to higher payroll, utility costs and real estate taxes. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for the 2004 Same Store Properties: 2004 vs. 2003 Year over Year Same Store Results $ in Millions 162,201 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses (1) NOI 2004 $ 1,613.5 $ 653.5 $ 960.0 2003 $ 1,599.4 $ 631.0 $ 968.4 Change $ 14.1 $ 22.5 $ (8.4 ) Change 0.9 % 3.6 % (0.9% ) (1) December 2004 expenses exclude the uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan & Jeanne. Same Store Occupancy Statistics Year 2004 93.3% Year 2003 93.0% Change 0.3% The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI for the 2004 Same Store Properties. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (Amounts in millions) Operating income $ 526.7 $ 530.3 Adjustments: Insurance (hurricane property damage) 15.2 Non same store operating results (114.7 ) (10.3 ) Fee and asset management revenue (11.2 ) (14.4 ) Fee and asset management expense 8.6 7.8 Depreciation 484.2 415.0 General and administrative 51.2 38.8 Impairment on technology investments 1.2 Same store NOI $ 960.0 $ 968.4 For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2004 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2005, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2005: 35 2005 Same Store Assumptions Physical Occupancy 94.0% Revenue Change 2.00% to 3.25% Expense Change 3.6% to 5.0% NOI Change 0.0% to 3.0% These 2005 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward looking. Rental income from properties other than 2004 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $172.6 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2004 Same Store Properties and the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated development projects. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased by $3.9 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from Ft. Lewis and managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company managed 17,988 units and 18,475 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities. Property management expenses include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses increased by approximately $7.8 million or 11.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to higher payroll costs, including bonuses and long term compensation costs as well as severance costs for certain employees. In addition, the property management company experienced slightly higher costs for travel, temporary help, internal conferences and legal and professional fees. Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased $69.2 million primarily as a result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated projects and properties acquired after December 31, 2003, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and also due to additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $12.4 million or 32.0% between the periods under comparison. This increase was primarily due to the costs of consulting services rendered to increase operating efficiencies and increased litigation and internal control costs. This increase was partially offset by $1.4 million of immediate expense recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to the Companys former chief executive officer. Consulting services were contracted to enhance resident satisfaction/retention, unit pricing and expense procurement/reduction. The Company believes that these additional expenditures may be more than offset by increased rental revenues and or reduced operating expenses in future years. The Company also anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward looking. The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income decreased approximately $5.5 million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investments including deposits in tax deferred exchange accounts and collateral agreements related to development projects. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $20.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in mortgage and unsecured note balances and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $14.0 million as compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in Partially Owned Properties (consolidated) 36 engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 5.87% as compared to 6.36% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $2.8 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously unconsolidated, partially offset by an increase in realized losses on the settlement of derivative instruments. Net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately $13.2 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the number of condominium units sold. Discontinued operations, net, decreased approximately $41.6 million between the periods under comparison. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002 For the year ended December 31, 2003, income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $30.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses incurred including property management costs and depreciation. Revenues from the 2003 Same Store Properties decreased by $38.2 million primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents. Property operating expenses from the 2003 Same Store Properties increased by $36.3 million primarily due to higher payroll, maintenance, utility, real estate taxes, insurance, leasing and advertising and building costs. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for the 2003 Same Store Properties: 2003 vs. 2002 Year over Year Same Store Results $in Millions 171,841 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses NOI 2003 $ 1,650.8 $ 659.0 $ 991.8 2002 $ 1,689.0 $ 622.7 $ 1,066.3 Change $ (38.2 ) $ 36.3 $ (74.5 ) Change (2.3% ) 5.8 % (7.0% ) Same Store Occupancy Statistics Year 2003 93.0% Year 2002 93.7% Change (0.7%) Rental income from properties other than 2003 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $47.5 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2003 Same Store Properties and additional Partially Owned Properties consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $4.9 million primarily as a result of additional income allocated from Ft. Lewis. As of December 31, 2003 and 37 2002, the Company managed 18,475 units and 18,965 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities. Property management expenses include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased by approximately $4.4 million or 6.0%. This decrease is primarily attributable to a reversal of a profit sharing accrual in the first quarter of 2003 related to the 2002 calendar year as the Company didnt achieve its stated goals and management elected not to make a discretionary contribution to the plan. In addition, the Company recorded lower expense in connection with granting less restricted shares and reducing the expense associated with the Companys matched funding of its 401(k) plan during 2003 and not incurring an expense for 2003 discretionary profit sharing contributions. Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased $25.4 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after December 31, 2002, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $7.7 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease was primarily due to lower expenses recorded in connection with granting less restricted shares to employees during 2003, partially offset by approximately a $2.6 million increase related to the Companys decision to begin to expense its stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148). In addition, lower state income and franchise taxes also contributed to this decrease. The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing business of approximately $1.2 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income increased by approximately $1.4 million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances available for short term investments throughout 2003. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $4.6 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $20.6 million as compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 6.36% as compared to 6.54% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $6.4 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of increased operating losses from equity investments partially offset by unrealized gains on derivative instruments. Net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately $206.4 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of a greater number of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2003, as well as the fact that several properties had lower net carrying values at sale. Discontinued operations, net, decreased approximately $53.6 million between the periods under comparison. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 38 Liquidity and Capital Resources For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 As of January 1, 2004, the Company had approximately $49.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $633.3 million available under its line of credit (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2004 was approximately $83.5 million and the amount available on the Companys line of credit was $484.6 million (net of $65.4 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following: Disposed of fifty eight properties (including four Unconsolidated Properties and various individual condominium units) and received net proceeds of approximately $945.6 million; Issued $300.0 million of 4.75% fixed rate unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $296.8 million; Issued $500.0 million of 5.25% fixed rate unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $496.1 million; Obtained $100.0 million from an unsecured floating rate loan; Obtained $467.5 million in new mortgage financing; and Issued approximately 3.6 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $85.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to: Acquire twenty four properties including a vacant land parcel, and four additional units at two existing properties, utilizing cash of $820.0 million; Repay $494.9 million of mortgage loans; Repay $535.7 million of unsecured notes; Redeem the Series A Preference Interests at a liquidation value of $40.0 million; Invest $406.5 million primarily in previously unconsolidated development projects prior to their consolidation (inclusive of $339.7 million in mortgage debt paid off prior to consolidation); and Acquire the minority interests in fifteen previously unconsolidated development properties, two vacant land parcels and four other properties for $53.4 million in cash (prior to consideration of cash acquired of $4.2 million). Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase up to an additional $85.0 million of its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share buyback program authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Company did not repurchase any of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2004. The Companys total debt summary and debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2004, are as follows: 39 Debt Summary $ Millions * Weighted Average Rate * Secured $ 3,167 5.46 % Unsecured 3,293 5.81 % Total $ 6,460 5.63 % Fixed Rate $ 5,071 6.45 % Floating Rate 1,389 2.51 % Total $ 6,460 5.63 % Above Totals Include: Tax Exempt Fixed $ 287 4.30 % Floating 562 1.79 % Total $ 849 2.70 % Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility $ 150 1.73 % * Net of the effect of any derivative instruments.

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories: Replacements (inside the unit). These include: carpets and hardwood floors; appliances; mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc; furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; flooring such as vinyl, linoleum or tile; and blinds/shades. All replacements are depreciated over a five year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above. Building improvements (outside the unit). These include: roof replacement and major repairs; paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks; amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices; major building mechanical equipment systems; interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding; major landscaping and grounds improvement; and vehicles and office and maintenance equipment. All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all recurring expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $212.2 million. This includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts): 42 Capitalized Improvements to Real Estate For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Units (1) Replacements Avg.

(4) Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.5 million included in building improvements spent on seven specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. The Company expects to fund approximately $160.0 million for capital expenditures for replacements and building improvements for all consolidated properties, exclusive of condominium conversion properties, in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Companys total non real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, was approximately $6.6 million. The 43 Company expects to fund approximately $12.8 million in total additions to non real estate property in 2005. Improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating activities. Derivative Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2004. Other Minority Interests as of December 31, 2004 decreased by $65.3 million when compared to December 31, 2003. The primary factors that impacted this account in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31, 2004 were: Distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $35.9 million (excluding Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions); The allocation of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $31.2 million; The issuance of 306,694 OP Units to various limited partners at an average price of $29.63 per unit; The redemption of 800,000 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preference Interests with a liquidation value of $40.0 million and a premium on redemption of $1.1 million (see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion); The issuance of Common Shares; and The conversion of 1.7 million OP Units into Common Shares valued at $36.9 million at an average price of $21.16 per unit. Total distributions paid in January 2005 amounted to $144.1 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004. The Company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit. The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. The Company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants 44 under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the $14.9 billion in investment in real estate on the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2004, $9.5 billion or 63.8%, was unencumbered. The Operating Partnership has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $700.0 million. This facility matures in May 2005 and may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements. As of March 1, 2005, $135.0 million was outstanding under this facility (and $51.0 million was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit). The Operating Partnership is currently negotiating a new credit facility to replace or expand its existing facility and fully expects to obtain this at current or improved terms in March or April 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has co invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Companys liquidity, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities. The nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows: Institutional Ventures During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures. The Companys joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Companys strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets. Lexford/Other As of December 31, 2004, the Company has ownership interests in twelve properties containing 1,571 units acquired in a prior merger. The current weighted average ownership percentage is 11.0%. The Companys strategy with respect to these interests is either to acquire a majority ownership or sell the Companys interest. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has five projects totaling 1,306 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through September 30, 2006. The three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms: The first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value. If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, the Company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value. The Companys partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property. In connection with this development partner, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing. As of February 2, 2005, the Company had set aside $5.0 million towards this credit enhancement. The Company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement. This agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018. Notwithstanding the termination of the agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred. The second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to require the Company to purchase the partners interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price. If the Company and the partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals. If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its 45 partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value. The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed upon value to an unrelated third party. Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed upon price, any projects remaining unsold. The third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization, as defined, to market a subject project for sale. Thereafter, either the Company or its development partner may market a subject project for sale. If the Companys development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project. If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property. Once a value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed upon value. See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys investments in unconsolidated entities. In connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project. The Company has the obligation to provide this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger or through May 2005. The Company would be required to perform under this guaranty only if there was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party. The counterparty has also indemnified the Company for any losses suffered. As of February 2, 2005, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of $10.4 million and no current outstanding liability. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Year (in thousands) Contractual Obligations 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 817,897 $ 491,617 $ 449,090 $ 626,939 $ 838,015 $ 3,236,248 $ 6,459,806 Operating Leases: Minimum Rent Payments (b) 4,816 4,205 3,464 3,335 3,233 7,369 26,422 Other Long Term Liabilities: Deferred Compensation (c) 813 1,807 2,211 2,211 2,211 11,230 20,483 Other (d) 1,000 1,000 Total $ 824,526 $ 497,629 $ 454,765 $ 632,485 $ 843,459 $ 3,254,847 $ 6,507,711 (a) Amounts include aggregate principal payments only. The Company paid $348,574, $352,391 and $365,782 for interest on debt, inclusive of derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and 46 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The six critical accounting policies are: Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Including Goodwill The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30 year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5 year to 10 year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5 year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations. Cost Capitalization See the Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property. The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes, through the date the certificates of occupancy ("CO") are issued (COs are deemed final within 90 days of issuance), interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major rennovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired. Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments. 47 Revenue Recognition Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight line basis. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis. Stock Based Compensation Prior to 2003, the Company had chosen to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Companys Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method). The Company elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted. SFAS No. 148 provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company elected the Prospective Method which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003. Compensation expense under all of the Companys plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards. Funds From Operations For the year ended December 31, 2004, Funds From Operations (FFO) available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $11.4 million, or 1.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2003, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased $78.9 million, or 11.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 48 Funds From Operations (Amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 472,329 $ 523,311 $ 400,777 Net income allocation to Minority Interests Operating Partnership 31,228 34,658 26,862 Adjustments: Depreciation 484,209 414,998 389,580 Depreciation Non real estate additions (5,574 ) (7,019 ) (9,213 ) Depreciation Partially Owned Properties (8,256 ) (8,390 ) (7,706 ) Depreciation Unconsolidated Properties 10,159 28,301 19,872 Net (gain) on sales of unconsolidated entities (4,593 ) (4,942 ) (5,054 ) Discontinued Operations: Depreciation 12,374 56,571 83,376 Net (gain) on sales of discontinued operations (323,925 ) (310,706 ) (104,296 ) Net incremental gain on sales of condominium units 32,054 10,280 1,682 Net gain on sales of vacant land 5,482 FFO (1)(2) 705,487 737,062 795,880 Preferred distributions (53,746 ) (76,435 ) (76,615 ) Premium on redemption of Preferred Shares (20,237 ) FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units $ 651,741 $ 640,390 $ 719,265 (1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines funds from operations (FFO) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Companys calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. 49 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in short term LIBOR interest rates. The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments. The fair values of the Companys financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, line of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The fair value of the Companys mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at December 31, 2004. The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1,389.0 million, or 21.5% of total debt at December 31, 2004, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 25 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $3.5 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 25 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $3.5 million. At December 31, 2004, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $5.1 billion, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 65 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $4.6 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 65 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $5.6 billion. At December 31, 2004, the Companys derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $7.9 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 40 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $13.9 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 40 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $2.2 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Companys debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to 50 the changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Companys financial structure or results. The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.
