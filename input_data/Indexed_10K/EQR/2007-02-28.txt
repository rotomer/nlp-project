Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Companys ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Partially Owned Properties Unconsolidated and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006. Forward looking statements in this Item 7 as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions made by management. While the Companys management believes the assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond managements control. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward looking statements because of subsequent events. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: We intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations and or conversion into condominiums, as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or development property up to standards established for its intended market position. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts. This competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price at which we expect to sell individual properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. We also plan to develop more properties ourselves in addition to co investing with our development partners for either the rental or condominium market, depending on opportunities in each sub market. This may increase the overall level of risk associated with our developments. The total number of development units, cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation. Sources of capital to the Company or labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development are more expensive than anticipated; Occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction of multifamily housing, slow employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the Companys control; 32 and Additional factors as discussed in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, particularly those under Risk Factors. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Forward looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in Notes 5 and 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Results of Operations In conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the Company has continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. In summary, we: Year Ended December 31, 2006: Acquired $1.8 billion of apartment properties consisting of 35 properties and 8,768 units, and $134.4 million of land parcels, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and Sold $2.3 billion of apartment properties consisting of 335 properties and 39,608 units, as well as 1,069 condominium units for $216.0 million and $1.6 million of land parcels. Year Ended December 31, 2005: Acquired $2.5 billion of apartment properties consisting of 41 properties and 12,059 units, and $138.3 million of land parcels, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and Sold $1.4 billion of apartment properties consisting of 50 properties and 12,848 units, as well as 2,241 condominium units for $593.3 million and five land parcels for $108.3 million. On June 28, 2006, the Company announced that it agreed to sell its Lexford Housing Division for a cash purchase price of $1.086 billion. The sale closed on October 5, 2006. The Lexford Housing Division results are classified as discontinued operations, net of minority interests, in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $418.7 million on the sale of the Lexford Housing Division in the fourth quarter of 2006. In conjunction with the Lexford disposition, the Company paid off/extinguished $196.3 million of mortgage notes payable secured by the properties and incurred approximately $9.2 million in prepayment penalties upon extinguishment. The Companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income (NOI). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Companys apartment communities. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2006 and 2005 (the 2006 Same Store Properties), which represented 128,133 units, impacted the Companys results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2005 and 2004 (the 2005 Same Store Properties), which represented 154,854 units, also impacted the Companys results of operations. Both the 2006 Same Store Properties and 2005 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs. The Companys acquisition, disposition, completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater 33 detail in the following paragraphs. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2006, income from continuing operations, net of minority interests, decreased by approximately $46.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in continuing operations is discussed below. Revenues from the 2006 Same Store Properties increased $88.7 million primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to residents. Expenses from the 2006 Same Store Properties increased $23.9 million primarily due to higher maintenance, payroll, utility costs and real estate taxes. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2006 Same Store Properties: 2006 vs. 2005 Year over Year Same Store Results/Statistics $ in Thousands (except for Average Rental Rate) 128,133 Same Store Units Results Statistics Description Revenues Expenses NOI Average Rental Rate (1) Occupancy Turnover 2006 $ 1,612,529 $ 628,210 $ 984,319 $ 1,110 94.6 % (64.6 )% 2005 $ 1,523,858 $ 604,318 $ 919,540 $ 1,050 94.6 % (65.5 )% Change $ 88,671 $ 23,892 $ 64,779 $ 60 0.0 % 0.9 % Change 5.8 % 4.0 % 7.0 % 5.7 % (1) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI for the 2006 Same Store Properties. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (Amounts in thousands) Operating income $ 513,143 $ 433,464 Adjustments: Non same store operating results (173,863 ) (22,851 ) Fee and asset management revenue (9,101 ) (10,240 ) Fee and asset management expense 8,934 8,555 Depreciation 562,739 439,594 General and administrative 48,465 70,405 Impairment 34,002 613 Same store NOI $ 984,319 $ 919,540 For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2006 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2007, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2007: 34 2007 Same Store Assumptions Physical Occupancy 95.0% Revenue Change 5.00% to 6.00% Expense Change 3.50% to 4.50% NOI Change 5.50% to 7.50% These 2007 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward looking. Non same store operating results increased $151.0 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2006 and 2005 as well as our corporate housing business. See also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys segment disclosures. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses decreased $1.5 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company managed 15,020 units and 16,269 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities. Property management expenses from continuing operations include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses increased by approximately $9.3 million or 10.7%. This increase is primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs and higher overall computer and training costs specific to the Companys rollout of a new property management system. Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased $123.1 million primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for all properties owned. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $21.9 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease was primarily due to lower executive compensation expense due to severance costs for several executive officers incurred during the year ended December 31, 2005 and a $2.8 million reimbursement of legal expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $50.0 million to $52.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2007. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking. Impairment from continuing operations increased $33.4 million between periods under comparison. This increase was primarily due to an impairment charge on goodwill of $30.0 million related to the corporate housing business and $2.0 million related to the write off of various deferred sales costs following the decision to halt the condominium conversion and sale process at five assets. Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $37.3 million, primarily as a result of the $57.1 million in cash received during the year ended December 31, 2005 for the Companys ownership interest in Rent.com, which was acquired by eBay, Inc. This was partially offset by the $3.7 million in additional proceeds for Rent.com, an increase in interest earned on tax deferred 1031 exchange proceeds from the Lexford disposition and $14.7 million of forfeited deposits for various terminated transactions received during the year ended December 31, 2006. Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $67.4 million primarily as a result of higher variable interest rates and overall debt levels outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $20.7 million as compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 6.21% as compared to 6.16% for the year ended December 31, 2005. 35 Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $1.1 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of consolidating previously unconsolidated properties as of January 1, 2006 as the result of EITF Issue No. 04 5. See Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased $1.0 million, due to increased unconsolidated sales during the year ended December 31, 2005. Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased $27.5 million, due to a large gain recorded on the sale of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2005. Discontinued operations, net of minority interests, increased approximately $257.8 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of lower real estate net book values for properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004 For the year ended December 31, 2005, income from continuing operations, net of minority interests, increased by approximately $58.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in continuing operations is discussed below. Revenues from the 2005 Same Store Properties increased $61.9 million primarily as a result of lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in average occupancy rates. Expenses from the 2005 Same Store Properties increased $36.2 million primarily due to higher payroll, utility costs and real estate taxes. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for the 2005 Same Store Properties: 2005 vs. 2004 Year over Year Same Store Results $ in Thousands 154,854 Same Store Units Description Revenues Expenses (1) NOI 2005 $ 1,636,753 $ 678,199 $ 958,554 2004 $ 1,574,843 $ 641,980 $ 932,863 Change $ 61,910 $ 36,219 $ 25,691 Change 3.9 % 5.6 % 2.8 % (1) Year 2005 expenses exclude $11.1 million of uninsured property damage caused by Hurricane Wilma. Year 2004 expenses exclude $15.2 million of uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. Same Store Occupancy Statistics Year 2005 94.1 % Year 2004 93.5 % Change 0.6 % Non same store operating results increased $78.6 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2005 and 2004 as well as our corporate housing business. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased by $1.5 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from Ft. Lewis and managing fewer properties for third 36 parties and unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company managed 16,269 units and 17,988 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities. Property management expenses from continuing operations include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses increased by approximately $10.2 million or 13.3%. This increase is primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs including bonuses, long term compensation costs and an increase of the Companys match for employee 401(k) contributions. Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased $58.9 million primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for all properties involved. General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $23.3 million between the periods under comparison. This increase was primarily due to higher executive compensation expense due to severance costs of $9.8 million for several executive officers, $7.9 million of additional accruals specific to performance shares for selected executive officers and a $2.5 million profit sharing accrual paid in the first quarter of 2006. Interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $59.6 million, primarily as a result of the $57.1 million in cash received for the Companys ownership interest in Rent.com, which was acquired by eBay, Inc. Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $55.3 million primarily as a result of higher overall debt balances as well as higher variable interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $13.7 million as compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 6.16% as compared to 5.87% for the year ended December 31, 2004. (Loss) income from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $7.8 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously unconsolidated in the first quarter of 2004. Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased $3.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in the number of unconsolidated entities sold. Net gain on sales of land parcels increased $24.8 million, primarily due to an increase in the number of land parcels sold and large gains recorded on two land parcels located in Tysons Corner, Virginia. Discontinued operations, net of minority interests, increased approximately $330.9 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of higher per unit sales prices and lower real estate net book values for properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 as well as higher condominium sales. The Company recognized $91.6 million and $32.1 million of net incremental gain on sales of condominium units (net of provision for income taxes) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 As of January 1, 2006, the Company had approximately $88.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $780.8 million available under its line of credit (net of $50.2 million which was restricted/dedicated to 37 support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2006 was approximately $260.3 million and the amount available on the Companys revolving credit facilities was $470.7 million (net of $69.3 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing). During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following: Disposed of 340 properties, various individual condominium units and two land parcels, receiving net proceeds of approximately $2.3 billion; Obtained $395.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $400.0 million of ten and one half year 5.375% fixed rate public notes and terminated six forward starting swaps designated to hedge the note issuance, receiving net proceeds of $10.7 million; Obtained $637.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $650.0 million of twenty year 3.85% exchangeable fixed rate public notes; Obtained $267.0 million in new mortgage financing; and Issued approximately 2.9 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $77.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to: Invest $291.3 million primarily in development projects; Acquire 35 properties and nine land parcels, utilizing cash of $1.7 billion; Repurchase 1.9 million Common Shares utilizing cash of $83.2 million; Repay $493.0 million of mortgage loans; Repay $60.0 million of fixed rate public notes; Redeem the series G Preference Interests at a liquidation value of $25.5 million; and Redeem the Series C Preferred Shares at a liquidation value of $115.0 million. Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share buyback program authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Company repurchased $83.2 million (1,897,912 shares at an average price per share of $43.85) of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2006 to offset the issuance of 1,144,326 OP Units in connection with three property acquisitions and to partially offset restricted shares granted and ESPP shares purchased during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company is authorized to repurchase approximately $501.8 million of additional Common Shares.

The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. The Company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the $17.2 billion in investment in real estate on the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2006, $11.6 billion or 67.0%, was unencumbered. The Operating Partnerships senior debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch are A , Baal (positive outlook) and A, respectively. The Companys preferred equity ratings from S&P, Moodys and Fitch are BBB+, Baa2 (positive outlook) and A , respectively. The Operating Partnership has a long term revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $1.0 billion which matures in May 2008. This facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements. As of February 26, 2007, $740.0 million was outstanding under this facility. See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to December 31, 2006. Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories: Replacements (inside the unit). These include: flooring such as carpets, hardwood, vinyl, linoleum or tile; appliances; mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc; furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and blinds/shades. All replacements are depreciated over a five year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all make ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above. Building improvements (outside the unit). These include: roof replacement and major repairs; paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks; amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices; major building mechanical equipment systems; interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding; major landscaping and grounds improvement; and vehicles and office and maintenance equipment. All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life. We capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must exceed 42 $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $255.2 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts): Capitalized Improvements to Real Estate For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Total Units (1) Replacements Avg.

(2) Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2004. (3) Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2004, 2005 and 2006. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 27,346 units. (4) Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $21.4 million included in building improvements spent on seventeen specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $232.5 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts): Capitalized Improvements to Real Estate For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Total Units (1) Replacements Avg.

(2) Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2003. (3) Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2003, 2004 and 2005. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 20,828 units. (4) Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.8 million included in building improvements spent on nine specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. The Company expects to fund approximately $145.0 million for capital expenditures for replacements and building improvements for all consolidated properties, exclusive of condominium conversion properties, in 2007. This includes an average of approximately $1,000 per unit for capital improvements for established properties. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Companys total non real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $10.7 million. The 43 Company expects to fund approximately $8.2 million in total additions to non real estate property in 2007. Improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating activities. Derivative Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2006. Other Minority Interests as of December 31, 2006 decreased by $10.7 million when compared to December 31, 2005. The primary factors that impacted this account in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31, 2006 were: The redemption or repurchase of 1.0 million units of Series G, H and I Preference Interests with a combined liquidation value of $48.5 million and a premium on redemption of $0.7 million (see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion); Distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $36.2 million (excluding Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions); The allocation of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $72.6 million; The issuance of 1,144,326 OP Units for the acquisition of three properties with a valuation of $49.6 million; and The conversion of 1.7 million OP Units into Common Shares valued at $27.9 million. Total distributions paid in January 2007 amounted to $152.4 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. 44 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has co invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Companys liquidity, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities. During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures. The Companys joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Companys strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has 11 projects totaling 3,448 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2009. The development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in Note 18 of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 2 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys investments in partially owned entities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Year (in thousands) Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 461,463 $ 1,009,834 $ 835,517 $ 279,323 $ 1,472,595 $ 3,998,924 $ 8,057,656 Operating Leases: Minimum Rent Payments (b) 5,443 5,302 4,709 4,119 2,416 2,963 24,952 Other Long Term Liabilities: Deferred Compensation (c) 813 813 1,450 1,450 2,049 14,736 21,311 Total $ 467,719 $ 1,015,949 $ 841,676 $ 284,892 $ 1,477,060 $ 4,016,623 $ 8,103,919 (a) Amounts include aggregate principal payments only. The Company paid $465,388, $397,886 and $348,574 for interest on debt, inclusive of derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (b) Minimum basic rent due for various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on a ground lease for one property. (c) Estimated payments to the Companys Chairman, two former CEOs and its chief operating officer based on planned retirement dates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2006 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The six critical accounting policies are: Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Including Goodwill The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected 45 holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30 year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5 year to 10 year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5 year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations. Cost Capitalization See the Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property. The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired. Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments. Revenue Recognition Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight line basis. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis. Share Based Compensation The Company accounts for its share based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006, which results in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the share compensation granted. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model is only one method 46 of valuing options and the Companys use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. Because the Companys share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be significantly different. Funds From Operations For the year ended December 31, 2006, Funds From Operations (FFO) available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased $68.5 million, or 8.7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $132.9 million, or 20.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for each of the five years ended December 31, 2006: Funds From Operations (Amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 1,072,844 $ 861,793 $ 472,329 $ 523,311 $ 400,777 Allocation to Minority Interests Operating Partnership, net 4,201 6,796 2,624 202 2,335 Adjustments: Depreciation 562,739 439,594 380,673 325,471 303,871 Depreciation Non real estate additions (7,840 ) (5,541 ) (5,303 ) (6,774 ) (9,029 ) Depreciation Partially Owned and Unconsolidated Properties 4,338 2,487 1,903 19,911 12,166 Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities (370 ) (1,330 ) (4,593 ) (4,942 ) (5,054 ) Discontinued operations: Depreciation 29,779 89,153 115,639 145,853 168,901 Gain on sales of discontinued operations, net of minority interests (3) (955,863 ) (650,563 ) (296,343 ) (287,372 ) (96,317 ) Net incremental gain on sales of condominium units 45,800 91,611 32,054 10,280 1,682 Minority Interests Operating Partnership 1,593 4,626 6,504 11,122 16,548 FFO (1)(2) 757,221 838,626 705,487 737,062 795,880 Preferred distributions (37,113 ) (49,642 ) (53,746 ) (76,435 ) (76,615 ) Premium on redemption of Preferred Shares (3,965 ) (4,359 ) (20,237 ) FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units $ 716,143 $ 784,625 $ 651,741 $ 640,390 $ 719,265 (1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines funds from operations (FFO) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an 47 alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Companys calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. (3) Gain on sales of discontinued operations, net of minority interests, has been reduced by approximately $4.5 million in one time accrued retention benefits for the year ended December 31, 2006, related to the previously announced October 5, 2006 closing of the Lexford Housing Division disposition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risks relating to the Companys financial instruments result primarily from changes in short term LIBOR interest rates. The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving credit facilities. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments. The fair values of the Companys financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The fair value of the Companys mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $3.2 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.5 billion, or 18.4% of total debt at December 31, 2006, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 49 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.3 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 49 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $6.6 billion, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 60 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.0 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 60 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $7.3 billion. At December 31, 2006, the Companys derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $16.2 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 54 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $16.4 million. If market rates of interest 48 permanently decreased by 54 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $16.2 million. The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.9 billion, or 24.9% of total debt at December 31, 2005, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 37 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.1 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 37 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.1 million. At December 31, 2005, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $5.7 billion, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 63 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $5.2 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 63 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.3 billion. At December 31, 2005, the Companys derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $6.0 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 49 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $0.1 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 49 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $11.5 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Companys debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Companys financial structure or results. The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.
