Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Companys ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes, except for an unconsolidated development land parcel and our military housing properties. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Forward Looking Statements Forward looking statements in this Item 7 as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions made by management. While the Companys management believes the assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to 31 Table of Contents differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond managements control. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events. The forward looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or supplement these forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to the following: We intend to actively acquire and or develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. We may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. We may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule, resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues and or lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts. This competition (or lack thereof) may increase (or depress) prices for multifamily properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. The total number of development units, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation; Debt financing and other capital required by the Company may not be available or may only be available on adverse terms; Labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated; Occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction and excess inventory of multifamily housing and single family housing, slow or negative employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the Companys control; and Additional factors as discussed in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, particularly those under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Forward looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Overview Equity Residential (EQR), a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) formed in March 1993, is an SP 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT. The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties in the United States (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Companys corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property management offices in each of its markets. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately 4,000 employees who provided real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions. EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2010 owned an approximate 95.5% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). All of EQRs property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the Company include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and or EQR. Business Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies The Company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital. Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. Revenue is maximized by driving qualified 32 Table of Contents resident prospects to our properties, converting this traffic cost effectively into new leases at the highest rent possible, keeping our residents satisfied and renewing their leases at yet higher rents. While we believe that it is our high quality, well located assets that bring our customers to us, it is our customer service that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends. We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web based resident portal which allows them to review their account and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on line. We seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation. These markets generally feature one or more of the following: High barriers to entry where, because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is difficult or costly to build new apartment properties leading to low supply; High single family home prices making our apartments a more economical housing choice; Strong economic growth leading to household formation and job growth, which in turn leads to high demand for our apartments; and An attractive quality of life leading to high demand and retention and allowing us to more readily increase rents. Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (OP Units) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and or sell based on market opportunities. The Company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure proceedings. The Company has also, in the past, converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business. The Company primarily sources the funds for its new property acquisitions in its core markets with the sales proceeds from selling assets that are older or located in non core markets. During the last five years, the Company has sold over 97,000 apartment units for an aggregate sales price of $7.2 billion and acquired nearly 25,000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately $5.5 billion. We are currently acquiring and developing assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas: Boston, New York, Washington DC, South Florida, Southern California, San Francisco, Seattle and to a lesser extent Denver. We also have investments (in the aggregate about 18% of our NOI) in other markets including Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon, New England excluding Boston, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville but do not intend to acquire or develop assets in these markets. As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially unoccupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed. We intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets. Currently, no single metropolitan area accounts for more than 17% of our NOI, though no guarantee can be made that NOI concentration may not increase in the future. We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. We provide many classroom and on line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites. We actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. We monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores. We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. With its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian friendly urban locations near public transportation. When developing and renovating our properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting and HVAC improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption. Current Environment Through much of 2009, the Company assumed a highly cautious outlook given uncertainty in the general economy and the capital markets and expected reduction in our property operations. In late 2009, the Company saw that occupancy was 33 Table of Contents firming. This was an especially encouraging sign as it came during the Companys seasonally slower fourth quarter. At the same time, the Company also saw marked improvement in the capital markets. In response, the Company began acquiring assets and increasing rents for both new and renewing residents, which led to better operating and investment performance for the Company. 2010 was characterized by higher occupancy and rent levels than 2009. The Company increased rents to a greater extent in markets like the Northeast, where the economy was stronger and multifamily operating conditions were better. In 2010, the Company ceased to hold the large cash balances (often $1.0 billion or more) that it held in 2009 in anticipation of debt maturities in an unsure capital markets climate. This had the result of increasing the Companys earnings by decreasing debt prefunding costs. Finally, the Company was aggressive in acquiring $1.5 billion of assets in its target markets in 2010. Improvement materialized throughout 2010 and as we enter 2011, we expect strong growth in same store revenue (anticipated increases ranging from 4.0% to 5.0%) and NOI (anticipated increases ranging from 5.0% to 7.5%) and are optimistic that the improvement realized in 2010 will be sustained for the foreseeable future. We currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets. In July 2010, the Company completed a $600.0 million unsecured ten year notes offering with a coupon of 4.75% and an all in effective interest rate of 5.09%. The all in rate combined with its accretive nature compared to maturing 2011 fixed rate debt led the Company to pursue this transaction. The Company also raised $291.9 million in equity under its ATM Common Share offering program in 2010 and has raised an additional $154.5 million under this program thus far in 2011. Given the strong market for many of our disposition assets and increased competition for assets in our target markets, we expect to be a net seller of assets in 2011 in contrast to being a net buyer of assets in 2010. The Company acquired 16 consolidated properties consisting of 4,445 apartment units for $1.5 billion and six land parcels for $68.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. While competition for the properties we were interested in acquiring increased as 2010 progressed due to the overall improvement in market fundamentals, we were able to close several, of what we believe are, long term, value added acquisition opportunities. Our acquisition pipeline has moderated and we expect a greater concentration of our 2011 acquisitions to occur in the latter half of the year. We believe our access to capital, our ability to execute large, complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company sold 35 consolidated properties consisting of 7,171 apartment units for $718.4 million and 27 unconsolidated properties consisting of 6,275 apartment units generating cash proceeds to the Company of $26.9 million, as well as 2 condominium units for $0.4 million and one land parcel for $4.0 million. We expect to continue strategic dispositions and see an increase in dispositions in 2011 as we believe there is currently a robust market and favorable pricing for certain of our non strategic assets. Our dispositions in 2010 were at higher capitalization (cap) rates (see definition in Results of Operations) than the acquisitions we completed. We expect this to continue in 2011 and expect to experience dilution from past and future transactions. We believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily convertible to cash, current availability on our revolving credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2011 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions, debt maturities and existing development projects through 2011. We expect that our remaining longer term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings, equity issuances (including the Companys ATM share offering program), property dispositions, joint ventures and cash generated from operations. There is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Any changes to their mandates could have a significant impact on the Company and may, among other things, lead to lower values for our disposition assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings. Such changes may also provide an advantage to us by making the cost of financing single family home ownership more expensive and provide us a competitive advantage given the size of our balance sheet and the multiple sources of capital to which we have access. We believe that the Company is well positioned as of December 31, 2010 (our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately 94.1% occupied (94.5% on a same store basis)), little new multifamily rental supply will be added to most of our markets over the next several years and the long term demographic picture is positive. We believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development fundings in the near term, and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future. As economic conditions continue to improve, the short term nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results. The Company anticipates that 2011 same store expenses will only increase 1.0% to 2.0% primarily due to modest increases in payroll expenses, real estate tax rates and utility cost growth (same store expenses increased 0.9% for 2010 when compared with the same period in the prior year). This follows three consecutive years of excellent expense control (same store expenses declined 0.1% between 2009 and 2008 and grew 2.2% between 2008 and 2007 and 2.1% between 2007 and 2006). The current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forward looking. 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations In conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the Company continued to invest in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. In summary, we: Year Ended December 31, 2010: Acquired $1.1 billion of apartment properties consisting of 14 consolidated properties and 3,207 apartment units at a weighted average cap rate (see definition below) of 5.4% and six land parcels for $68.9 million, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; Acquired one unoccupied property in the second quarter of 2010 (425 Mass in Washington, D.C.) for $166.8 million consisting of 559 apartment units that is expected to stabilize in its third year of ownership at an 8.5% yield on cost and one property in the third quarter of 2010 (Vantage Pointe in San Diego, CA) for $200.0 million consisting of 679 apartment units that was in the early stages of lease up and is expected to stabilize in its third year of ownership at a 7.0% yield on cost; Acquired the 75% equity interest it did not own in seven previously unconsolidated properties consisting of 1,811 apartment units at an implied cap rate of 8.4% in exchange for an approximate $30.0 million payment to its joint venture partner; Sold $718.4 million of consolidated apartment properties consisting of 35 properties and 7,171 apartment units at a weighted average cap rate of 6.7%, 2 condominium units for $0.4 million and one land parcel for $4.0 million, the majority of which was in exit or less desirable markets; and Sold the last of its 25% equity interests in an institutional joint venture consisting of 27 unconsolidated properties containing 6,275 apartment units. These properties were valued in their entirety at $417.8 million which results in an implied weighted average cap rate of 7.5% (generating cash to the Company, net of debt repayments, of $26.9 million). Year Ended December 31, 2009: Acquired $145.0 million of apartment properties consisting of two properties and 566 apartment units (excluding the Companys buyout of its partners interest in one previously unconsolidated property) and a long term leasehold interest in a land parcel for $11.5 million, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and Sold $1.0 billion of apartment properties consisting of 60 properties and 12,489 apartment units (excluding the Companys buyout of its partners interest in one previously unconsolidated property), as well as 62 condominium units for $12.0 million, the majority of which was in exit or less desirable markets. The Companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income (NOI). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Companys apartment communities. The cap rate is generally the first year NOI yield (net of replacements) on the Companys investment. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2010 and 2009 (the 2010 Same Store Properties), which represented 112,042 apartment units, impacted the Companys results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2009 and 2008 (the 2009 Same Store Properties), which represented 113,598 apartment units, also impacted the Companys results of operations. Both the 2010 Same Store Properties and 2009 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs. The Companys acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Dilution, as a result of the Companys net asset sales in 2009, partially offset by net asset acquisitions and lease up activity in 2010, negatively impacts property net operating income. The impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.95 compared to $1.27 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009. The difference is primarily due to $37.3 million in lower gains from property sales in 2010 vs. 2009 and $34.3 million in higher impairment losses in 2010 vs. 2009. 35 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, loss from continuing operations increased approximately $22.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in continuing operations is discussed below. Revenues from the 2010 Same Store Properties decreased $2.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents, partially offset by an increase in occupancy. Expenses from the 2010 Same Store Properties increased $6.2 million primarily due to increases in repairs and maintenance expenses (mostly due to greater storm related costs such as snow removal and roof repairs incurred during the first quarter of 2010), higher property management costs and increases in utility costs, partially offset by lower real estate taxes and leasing and advertising expenses. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2010 Same Store Properties: 2010 vs. 2009 Same Store Results/Statistics $ in thousands (except for Average Rental Rate) 112,042 Same Store Units Results Statistics Average Rental Description Revenues Expenses NOI Rate (1) Occupancy Turnover 2010 $ 1,728,268 $ 654,663 $ 1,073,605 $ 1,358 94.8% 56.7% 2009 $ 1,730,335 $ 648,508 $ 1,081,827 $ 1,375 93.7% 61.5% Change $ (2,067) $ 6,155 $ (8,222) $ (17) 1.1% (4.8)% Change (0.1%) 0.9% (0.8)% (1.2%) (1) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period.

(4) Property management costs Includes payroll and related expenses for departments, or portions of departments, that directly support on site management. These include such departments as regional and corporate property management, property accounting, human resources, training, marketing and revenue management, procurement, real estate tax, property legal services and information technology. (5) Other on site operating expenses Includes administrative costs such as office supplies, telephone and data charges and association and business licensing fees. 36 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI for the 2010 Same Store Properties. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (Amounts in thousands) Operating income $ 442,001 $ 496,601 Adjustments: Non same store operating results (105,960 ) (21,336 ) Fee and asset management revenue (9,476 ) (10,346 ) Fee and asset management expense 5,140 7,519 Depreciation 656,633 559,271 General and administrative 39,887 38,994 Impairment 45,380 11,124 Same store NOI $ 1,073,605 $ 1,081,827 For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2010 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2011, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2011: 2011 Same Store Assumptions Physical occupancy 95.0% Revenue change 4.0% to 5.0% Expense change 1.0% to 2.0% NOI change 5.0% to 7.5% The Company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of $1.0 billion and consolidated rental dispositions of $1.25 billion and expects that acquisitions will have a 1.25% lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending December 31, 2011. These 2011 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward looking. Non same store operating results increased approximately $84.6 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2009 and 2010, as well as operations from the Companys completed development properties and corporate housing business. While the operations of the non same store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2010 similar to the same store assets, the non same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total NOI to the Companys overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in lease up and a longer ownership period in 2010 than 2009. This increase primarily resulted from: Development and other miscellaneous properties in lease up of $32.4 million; Newly stabilized development and other miscellaneous properties of $0.2 million; Properties acquired in 2009 and 2010 of $56.2 million; and Partially offset by an allocation of property management costs not included in same store results and operating activities from other miscellaneous operations, such as the Companys corporate housing business. See also Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys segment disclosures. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $1.5 million or 53.4% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Companys military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses, partially offset by the unwinding of the Companys institutional joint ventures during 2010 (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Property management expenses from continuing operations include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses increased approximately $9.2 million or 12.8%. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll related costs (due primarily to higher health insurance and bonus costs, acceleration of long term compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and the creation of the Companys central business group, which moved administrative functions off site), legal and professional fees, education/conference expenses, real estate tax consulting fees and travel expenses. 37 Table of Contents Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased approximately $97.4 million or 17.4% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2009 and 2010, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned. General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $0.9 million or 2.3% primarily due to higher overall payroll related costs (due primarily to higher bonus costs), partially offset by lower tax compliance fees and office rents. The Company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $40.0 million to $42.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2011. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking. Impairment from continuing operations increased approximately $34.3 million due to a $45.4 million impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of 2010 on land held for development related to two potential development projects compared to an $11.1 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on land held for development. See Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $11.1 million or 67.0% primarily as a result of a decrease in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment securities due to lower interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2010 and lower overall balances as well as gains on debt extinguishment and the sale of investment securities recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010, partially offset by an increase in insurance/litigation settlement proceeds. The Company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $2.0 million to $3.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2011. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking. Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $5.4 million or 83.9% primarily due to an increase in the expensing of overhead (pursuit cost write offs) as a result of the Companys decision to reduce its development activities in prior periods as well as an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the Companys significantly higher acquisition volume in 2010. Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $27.8 million or 5.5% primarily as a result of lower overall debt balances and higher debt extinguishment costs due to the significant debt repurchases in 2009 and lower rates in 2010, partially offset by interest expense on the $500.0 million mortgage pool that closed in 2009, the $600.0 million of unsecured notes that closed in July 2010 and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $13.0 million as compared to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 5.14% as compared to 5.62% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company anticipates that interest expense (excluding debt extinguishment costs and convertible debt discounts) will approximate $470.0 million to $480.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2011. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking. Income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately $2.5 million or 88.1% primarily due to a decrease in franchise taxes for Texas and a decrease in business taxes for Washington, D.C. The Company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate $0.5 million to $1.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2011. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking. Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $2.1 million or 73.9% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the Companys $1.8 million share of defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of cross collateralized mortgage debt on one of the Companys partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures taken during the year ended December 31, 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010. Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $17.4 million primarily due to larger gains on sale and revaluation of seven previously unconsolidated properties that were acquired from the Companys joint venture partner and the gain on sale for 27 properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with unconsolidated properties sold in the same period in 2009. Net loss on sales of land parcels increased approximately $1.4 million primarily due to the loss on sale of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2010. Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $63.3 million or 16.7% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 and the operations of those properties. In addition, properties sold in 2010 reflect operations for none of or a 38 Table of Contents partial period in 2010 in contrast to a full or partial period in 2009. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.27 compared to $1.46 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008. The difference is primarily due to the following: $57.6 million in lower net gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2009 vs. 2008; $84.0 million in lower property NOI in 2009 vs. 2008, primarily driven by $51.6 million in lower same store NOI and dilution from transaction activities, partially offset by higher NOI contributions from lease up properties; and Partially offset by $105.3 million in lower impairment losses in 2009 vs. 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, income from continuing operations increased approximately $43.0 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in continuing operations is discussed below. Revenues from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased $52.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents and a decrease in occupancy. Expenses from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased $0.8 million primarily due to lower property management costs, partially offset by higher real estate taxes and utility costs. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2009 Same Store Properties: 2009 vs. 2008 Same Store Results/Statistics $ in thousands (except for Average Rental Rate) 113,598 Same Store Units Results Statistics Average Rental Description Revenues Expenses NOI Rate (1) Occupancy Turnover 2009 $ 1,725,774 $ 644,294 $ 1,081,480 $ 1,352 93.8% 61.0% 2008 $ 1,778,183 $ 645,123 $ 1,133,060 $ 1,383 94.5% 63.7% Change $ (52,409) $ (829) $ (51,580) $ (31) (0.7%) (2.7%) Change (2.9%) (0.1%) (4.6%) (2.2%) (1) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period.

Recoveries are reflected in rental income. (3) Repairs and maintenance Includes general maintenance costs, unit turnover costs including interior painting, routine landscaping, security, exterminating, fire protection, snow removal, elevator, roof and parking lot repairs and other miscellaneous building repair costs. (4) Property management costs Includes payroll and related expenses for departments, or portions of departments, that directly support on site management. These include such departments as regional and corporate property management, property accounting, human resources, training, marketing and revenue management, procurement, real estate tax, property legal services and information technology. (5) Other on site operating expenses Includes administrative costs such as office supplies, telephone and data charges and association and business licensing fees. Non same store operating results increased approximately $34.3 million or 79.4% and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2009, as well as operations from the Companys completed development properties and our corporate housing business. While the operations of the non same store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2009 similar to the same store assets, the non same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total NOI to the Companys overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in lease up and a longer ownership period in 2009 than 2008. This increase primarily resulted from: Development and other miscellaneous properties in lease up of $22.4 million; Newly stabilized development and other miscellaneous properties of $1.6 million; Properties acquired in 2008 and 2009 of $11.9 million; and Partially offset by operating activities from other miscellaneous operations. See also Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys segment disclosures. Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $0.1 million or 3.4% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Companys military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company managed 12,681 apartment units and 14,485 apartment units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord. Property management expenses from continuing operations include off site expenses associated with the self management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased approximately $5.1 million or 6.7%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payroll related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Companys portfolio, as well as decreases in temporary help/contractors, telecommunications and travel expenses. Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non real estate assets, increased approximately $23.0 million or 4.3% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2008 and 2009, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned. General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $6.0 million or 13.3% primarily due to lower overall payroll related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Companys portfolio, as well as a $2.9 million decrease in severance related costs in 2009 and a decrease in tax consulting costs. Impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately $105.3 million due to an $11.1 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on a land parcel held for development compared to a $116.4 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to five potential development projects that are no longer being pursued. See Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $16.8 million or 50.3% primarily as a result of an $18.7 million gain recognized during 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the Companys notes compared to a $4.5 million gain recognized in 2009 (see Note 9). In addition, interest earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased due to a decrease in interest rates and because the Company received less insurance/litigation settlement proceeds and forfeited deposits in 2009, partially offset by a $4.9 million gain on the sale of investment securities realized in 2009. Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $0.7 million or 12.6% primarily due to an increase in transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the Companys acquisition of two properties consisting of 566 apartment units from unaffiliated parties, as well as expensing transaction costs associated with the Companys acquisition of all of its partners interests in five previously partially owned properties consisting of 1,587 apartment units in 2009. 40 Table of Contents Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $16.9 million or 3.4% primarily as a result of an increase in debt extinguishment costs and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $34.9 million as compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 5.62% as compared to 5.56% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately $2.5 million or 46.9% primarily due to a change in the estimate for Texas state taxes and lower overall state income taxes, partially offset by an increase in business taxes for Washington, D.C. Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $2.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the Companys $1.8 million share of defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of cross collateralized mortgage debt on one of the Companys partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures as well as a decline in the operating performance of these properties. Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $7.8 million as the Company sold seven unconsolidated properties in 2009 (inclusive of the one property where the Company acquired its partners interest) compared to three unconsolidated properties in 2008. Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $3.0 million due to the sale of vacant land located in Florida during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus no land sales in 2009. Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $97.4 million or 20.4% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and the operations of those properties. In addition, properties sold in 2009 reflect operations for a partial period in 2009 in contrast to a full period in 2008. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 As of January 1, 2010, the Company had approximately $193.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, its restricted 1031 exchange proceeds totaled $244.3 million and it had $1.37 billion available under its revolving credit facility (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2010 was approximately $431.4 million, its restricted 1031 exchange proceeds totaled $103.9 million and the amount available on the Companys revolving credit facility was $1.28 billion (net of $147.3 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following: Disposed of 35 consolidated properties, 27 unconsolidated properties, 2 condominium units and one land parcel, receiving net proceeds of approximately $699.6 million; Obtained $173.6 million in new mortgage financing; Issued $600.0 million of unsecured notes receiving net proceeds of $595.4 million before underwriting fees and other expenses; and Issued approximately 8.8 million Common Shares (including shares issued under the ATM program see further discussion below) and received net proceeds of $406.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to: Acquire 16 rental properties and six land parcels for approximately $1.2 billion; Acquire the 75% equity interest it did not own in seven previously unconsolidated properties consisting of 1,811 apartment units in exchange for an approximate $26.9 million payment to its joint venture partner (net of $3.1 million in cash acquired); Invest $131.3 million primarily in development projects; 41 Table of Contents Repurchase 58,130 Common Shares, utilizing cash of $1.9 million (see Note 3); Repay $652.1 million of mortgage loans; and Settle a forward starting swap, utilizing cash of $10.0 million. In September 2009, the Company announced the establishment of an At The Market (ATM) share offering program which would allow the Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time to time over the next three years into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. The Company may, but shall have no obligation to, sell Common Shares through the ATM share offering program in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Companys Common Shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company issued approximately 6.2 million Common Shares at an average price of $47.45 per share for total consideration of approximately $291.9 million through the ATM share offering program. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.38 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.7 million through the ATM share offering program. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011 through January 13, 2011, the Company has issued approximately 3.0 million Common Shares at an average price of $50.84 per share for total consideration of approximately $154.5 million. The Company has not issued any shares under this program since January 13, 2011. Through February 16, 2011, the Company has cumulatively issued approximately 12.7 million Common Shares at an average price of $44.94 per share for total consideration of approximately $570.1 million. Including its recently filed prospectus supplement which added 5,687,478 Common Shares, the Company has 10.0 million Common Shares remaining available for issuance under the ATM program. Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Company repurchased $1.9 million (58,130 shares at an average price per share of $32.46) of its Common Shares (all related to the vesting of employee restricted shares) during the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had authorization to repurchase an additional $464.6 million of its shares. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, the Company may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

Effective April 12, 2010, the Company exercised the first of its two one year extension options. As a result, the maturity date is now October 5, 2011 and there is one remaining one year extension option exercisable by the Company. (5) As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $1.28 billion available on the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility. An unlimited amount of equity and debt securities remains available for issuance by EQR and the Operating Partnership under effective shelf registration statements filed with the SEC. Most recently, EQR and the Operating Partnership filed a universal shelf registration statement for an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities that became automatically effective upon filing with the SEC in October 2010 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on October 14, 2013 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount). However, as of February 16, 2011, issuances under the ATM share offering program are limited to 10.0 million additional shares. 44 Table of Contents The Companys Consolidated Debt to Total Market Capitalization Ratio as of December 31, 2010 is presented in the following table. The Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Companys Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange and (ii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares outstanding.

The Company generally expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Under normal operating conditions, the Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. However, there may be times when the Company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions, which may cause the Company to consider reducing its distributions and or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. Should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the Companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels. The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825 per share to $0.3375 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company announced a new dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts more closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the Companys core business and provide transparency to investors. The Company intends to pay an annual cash dividend equal to approximately 65% of Normalized FFO. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company paid $0.3375 per share for each of the first three quarters and $0.4575 per share for the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year (an annual rate of $1.47 per share) to approximately 65% of Normalized FFO. The Company anticipates the expected dividend payout will be $1.56 to $1.62 per share ($0.3375 per share for each of the first three quarters with the balance for the fourth quarter) for the year ending December 31, 2011. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking. While the new dividend policy makes it less likely that the Company will over distribute, it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than in the past should operating results deteriorate. The Company believes that its expected 2011 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions. 45 Table of Contents The Company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties as well as joint ventures. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the $19.7 billion in investment in real estate on the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2010, $12.6 billion or 63.9%, was unencumbered. However, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise. The Operating Partnerships credit ratings from Standard Poors (SP), Moodys and Fitch for its outstanding senior debt are BBB+, Baal and BBB+, respectively. The Companys equity ratings from SP, Moodys and Fitch for its outstanding preferred equity are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB , respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Fitch downgraded the Operating Partnerships credit rating from A to BBB+ and the Companys equity rating from BBB+ to BBB , which does not have an effect on the Companys cost of funds. During the first quarter of 2011, Moodys raised its outlook for both the Company and the Operating Partnership from negative outlook to stable outlook. The Operating Partnership has a $1.425 billion (net of $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is not available for borrowing) long term revolving credit facility with available borrowings as of February 16, 2011 of $1.34 billion (net of $83.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above) that matures in February 2012 (See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). This facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements. On July 16, 2010, a portion of the parking garage collapsed at one of the Companys rental properties (Prospect Towers in Hackensack, New Jersey). The Company estimates that the costs related to such collapse (both expensed and capitalized), including providing for residents interim needs, lost revenue and garage reconstruction, will be approximately $12.0 million, after insurance reimbursements of $8.0 million. Costs to rebuild the garage will be capitalized as incurred. Other costs, like those to accommodate displaced residents, lost revenue due to a portion of the property being temporarily unavailable for occupancy and legal costs, will reduce earnings as they are incurred. Generally, insurance proceeds will be recorded as increases to earnings as they are received. An impairment charge of $1.3 million was recognized to write off the net book value of the collapsed garage. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company received approximately $4.0 million in insurance proceeds which fully offset the impairment charge and partially offset expenses of $5.5 million that were recorded relating to this loss and are included in real estate taxes and insurance on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company estimates that its lost revenues approximated $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of the high rise tower being unoccupied following the garage collapse. See Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to December 31, 2010. Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories: Replacements (inside the unit). These include: flooring such as carpets, hardwood, vinyl, linoleum or tile; appliances; mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc; furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and blinds/shades. All replacements are depreciated over a five year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all make ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above. Building improvements (outside the unit). These include: roof replacement and major repairs; 46 Table of Contents paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks; amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices; major building mechanical equipment systems; interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding; major landscaping and grounds improvement; and vehicles and office and maintenance equipment. All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life. We capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $138.2 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts): Capital Expenditures to Real Estate For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Total Avg.

(2) Replacements Includes new expenditures inside the apartment units such as appliances, mechanical equipment, fixtures and flooring, including carpeting. Replacements for same store properties also include $31.7 million spent in 2010 on apartment unit renovations/rehabs (primarily kitchens and baths) on 4,331 apartment units (equating to about $7,300 per apartment unit rehabbed) designed to reposition these assets for higher rental levels in their respective markets. (3) Same Store Properties Primarily includes all properties acquired or completed and stabilized prior to January 1, 2009, less properties subsequently sold. (4) Non Same Store Properties Primarily includes all properties acquired during 2009 and 2010, plus any properties in lease up and not stabilized as of January 1, 2009. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 9,141 apartment units. (5) Other Primarily includes expenditures for properties sold during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $123.9 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts): Capital Expenditures to Real Estate For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Total Avg.

(3) Same Store Properties Primarily includes all properties acquired or completed and stabilized prior to January 1, 2008, less properties subsequently sold. (4) Non Same Store Properties Primarily includes all properties acquired during 2008 and 2009, plus any properties in lease up and not stabilized as of January 1, 2008. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 9,823 apartment units. (5) Other Primarily includes expenditures for properties sold during the period. 47 Table of Contents For 2011, the Company estimates that it will spend approximately $1,200 per apartment unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of unit renovation/rehab costs, or $850 per apartment unit excluding unit renovation/rehab costs. For 2011, the Company estimates that it will spend $41.0 million rehabbing 5,500 apartment units (equating to about $7,500 per apartment unit rehabbed). The above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward looking. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Companys total non real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $3.0 million. The Company expects to fund approximately $8.5 million in total additions to non real estate property in 2011. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking. Improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow. Derivative Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2010. Other Total distributions paid in January 2011 amounted to $141.3 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company had co invested in various properties that were unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Management does not believe these investments had a materially different impact upon the Companys liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its other property management and ownership activities. During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 apartment units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures. The Companys joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Companys strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had sold its interest in these unconsolidated ventures with the exception of eight properties consisting of 2,061 apartment units which were acquired by the Company. All of the related debt encumbering these ventures was extinguished. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has four projects totaling 717 apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through September 30, 2012, as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized. The development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in Note 18 of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 2 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys investments in partially owned entities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2010: 48 Table of Contents Payments Due by Year (in thousands) Contractual Obligations 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Debt: Principal (a) $ 1,665,991 $ 816,309 $ 578,987 $ 584,617 $ 357,713 $ 5,944,459 $ 9,948,076 Interest (b) 460,045 407,793 367,642 344,599 309,043 1,016,041 2,905,163 Operating Leases: Minimum Rent Payments (c) 5,478 4,285 4,431 4,736 4,729 320,928 344,587 Other Long Term Liabilities: Deferred Compensation (d) 1,457 1,770 1,485 1,677 1,677 9,182 17,248 Total $ 2,132,971 $ 1,230,157 $ 952,545 $ 935,629 $ 673,162 $ 7,290,610 $ 13,215,074 (a) Amounts include aggregate principal payments only and includes in 2011 a $500.0 million term loan that the Company has the right to extend to 2012. (b) Amounts include interest expected to be incurred on the Companys secured and unsecured debt based on obligations outstanding at December 31, 2010 and inclusive of capitalized interest. For floating rate debt, the current rate in effect for the most recent payment through December 31, 2010 is assumed to be in effect through the respective maturity date of each instrument. (c) Minimum basic rent due for various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on ground leases for four properties/parcels. (d) Estimated payments to the Companys Chairman, Vice Chairman and two former CEOs based on planned retirement dates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2010 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The five critical accounting policies are: Acquisition of Investment Properties The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the Companys ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. 49 Table of Contents Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30 year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5 year to 10 year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5 year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations. Cost Capitalization See the Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate section for a discussion of the Companys policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property. For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired. Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments. Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations For the year ended December 31, 2010, Funds From Operations (FFO) available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units increased $7.3 million, or 1.2%, and $20.9 million, or 3.2%, respectively, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units decreased $2.9 million, or 0.5%, and $73.5 million, or 10.0%, respectively, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. 50 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units for each of the five years ended December 31, 2010: Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations (Amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 295,983 $ 382,029 $ 436,413 $ 1,047,356 $ 1,147,617 Adjustments: Net (income) loss attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Preference Interests and Units (9 ) (15 ) (441 ) (2,002 ) Partially Owned Properties 726 558 (2,650 ) (2,200 ) (3,132 ) Premium on redemption of Preference Interests (684 ) Depreciation 656,633 559,271 536,283 509,358 429,737 Depreciation Non real estate additions (6,788 ) (7,355 ) (8,269 ) (8,279 ) (7,840 ) Depreciation Partially Owned and Unconsolidated Properties (1,619 ) 759 4,157 4,379 4,338 Net (gain) on sales of unconsolidated entities (28,101 ) (10,689 ) (2,876 ) (2,629 ) (370 ) Discontinued operations: Depreciation 16,770 41,104 66,625 107,056 162,780 Net (gain) on sales of discontinued operations (297,956 ) (335,299 ) (392,857 ) (933,013 ) (1,025,803 ) Net incremental gain (loss) on sales of condominium units 1,506 (385 ) (3,932 ) 20,771 48,961 FFO (1)(3) 637,154 629,984 632,879 742,358 753,602 Adjustments: Asset impairment and valuation allowances 45,380 11,124 116,418 30,000 Property acquisition costs and write off of pursuit costs (other expenses) 11,928 6,488 5,760 1,830 4,661 Debt extinguishment (gains) losses, including prepayment penalties, preferred share redemptions and non cash convertible debt discounts 8,594 34,333 (2,784 ) 24,004 21,563 (Gains) losses on sales of non operating assets, net of income and other tax expense (benefit) (80 ) (5,737 ) (979 ) (34,450 ) (48,592 ) Other miscellaneous non comparable items (6,186 ) (171 ) (1,725 ) (5,767 ) (20,880 ) Normalized FFO (2)(3) $ 696,790 $ 676,021 $ 749,569 $ 727,975 $ 740,354 FFO (1)(3) $ 637,154 $ 629,984 $ 632,879 $ 742,358 $ 753,602 Preferred distributions (14,368 ) (14,479 ) (14,507 ) (22,792 ) (37,113 ) Premium on redemption of Preferred Shares (6,154 ) (3,965 ) FFO available to Common Shares and Units (1)(3)(4) $ 622,786 $ 615,505 $ 618,372 $ 713,412 $ 712,524 Normalized FFO (2)(3) $ 696,790 $ 676,021 $ 749,569 $ 727,975 $ 740,354 Preferred distributions (14,368 ) (14,479 ) (14,507 ) (22,792 ) (37,113 ) Premium on redemption of Preferred Shares (6,154 ) (3,965 ) Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units (2)(3)(4) $ 682,422 $ 661,542 $ 735,062 $ 699,029 $ 699,276 (1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines funds from operations (FFO) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of apartment units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) Normalized funds from operations (Normalized FFO) begins with FFO and excludes: the impact of any expenses relating to asset impairment and valuation allowances; property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write offs (other expenses); gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred share redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non cash convertible debt discounts; 51 Table of Contents gains and losses on the sales of non operating assets, including gains and losses from land parcel and condominium sales, net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses; and other miscellaneous non comparable items. (3) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. The company also believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the companys operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Companys actual operating results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Companys calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. (4) FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership. Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one for one basis. 52 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risks relating to the Companys financial instruments result primarily from changes in short term LIBOR interest rates and changes in the SIFMA index for tax exempt debt. The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well as floating rate tax exempt debt. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. To the extent the Company carries substantial cash balances, this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates. The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk. Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments. The fair values of the Companys financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The fair value of the Companys mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $4.7 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, the Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.7 billion, or 17.5% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 14 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 14 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million. At December 31, 2010, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $8.2 billion, or 82.5% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 57 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $7.5 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 57 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $9.1 billion. At December 31, 2010, the Companys derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $23.3 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 12 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $9.8 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 12 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $37.0 million. At December 31, 2009, the Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.8 billion, or 19.7% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 13 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 13 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million. At December 31, 2009, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $7.5 billion, or 80.3% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 59 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.9 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 59 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt would be approximately $8.4 billion. 53 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, the Companys derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately $25.2 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 20 basis points (a 10% increase from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $35.5 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 20 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Companys existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the Companys derivative instruments would be approximately $15.9 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Companys debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Companys financial structure or results. The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.
