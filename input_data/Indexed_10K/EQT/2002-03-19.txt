Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon Equitables consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies affect the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition: Revenues for regulated natural gas sales to retail customers are recognized as service is rendered, including an accrual for unbilled revenues from the date of each meter reading to the end of the accounting period. Revenue is recognized for exploration and production activities when deliveries of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids occur. Revenues from natural gas transportation and storage activities are recognized in the period the service is provided. Revenues from energy marketing activities are recognized when deliveries occur. Revenues from activities classified as energy trading are recognized immediately. The Company recognizes revenue from shared energy savings contracts as energy savings are measured and verified. Revenue received from customer contract termination payments is recognized when received. Revenue from other long term contracts including energy savings performance contracts, such as turnkey contracts, is recognized on a percentage of completion basis, determined using the cost to cost method (see below for expanded discussion of this method). Any maintenance revenues are recognized as related services are performed. Oil & Gas Properties Successful Efforts Method: Equitable uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method has only the cost of successful drilling capitalized as oil and gas properties. Costs of exploratory dry holes, geological and geophysical, delay rentals, and other property carrying costs are charged to expense. All general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are computed using the unit of production method by aggregation of properties. The costs of unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed on a field by field basis. If unproved properties are determined to be productive, the related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. If unproved properties are determined not to be productive, or if the value has been otherwise impaired, the excess carrying value is charged to expense. For purposes of determining whether proved oil and gas properties have been impaired, Equitable utilizes forward market prices (including estimates of forward market prices for periods that extend beyond those with quoted market prices) as of the evaluation date in estimating the future cash flows from the oil and gas properties. This forward market price information is consistent with that generally used in drilling and acquisition planning and decision making. In the impairment calculation, these market prices for future periods are used to value the estimated production from proved reserves for the corresponding periods in arriving at future cash flows. No changes in production from the profile included in the year end reserve report are assumed. The carrying value of the Companys proved oil and gas properties are reviewed on a field by field basis for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. In order to determine whether impairment has occurred, Equitable estimates the expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from the Companys proved oil and gas properties and compares them to their respective carrying values. The estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based 15 on proved reserves utilizing our assumptions about the use of the asset and forward market prices for oil and gas. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of undiscounted future cash flows are deemed unrecoverable. Those properties are then written down to fair value, which is estimated using assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. In developing estimates of fair value, the Company used forward market prices. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company did not recognize impairment charges on oil and gas properties. Percentage of Completion Method of Accounting: NORESCO recognizes revenue and profit as work on long term contracts progresses using the percentage of completion method of accounting. The method relies on estimates of total expected costs. NORESCO follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of the contract, recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Accordingly, favorable changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition, and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profits. When estimates indicate a loss under a contract, cost of sales is charged with a provision for such loss. As work progresses under a loss contract, revenues continue to be recognized, and a portion of the contract costs incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve. The Company had no loss contracts as of December 31, 2001. Hedging and Derivatives: Equitables primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas. The Company uses a variety of techniques to minimize this exposure, which includes sales of gas properties, other monetizations, and prepaid natural gas sales. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effect of this volatility. The Companys strategy is to become more highly hedged at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels. The Company uses simple, non leveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is continually monitored. The Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors approved a set of policies that guides the use of these derivative financial instruments. Equitables use of these derivatives is further explained in Note B to the consolidated financial statements and in Part II Item 7A, Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk. With respect to hedging the Companys exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices, under current market conditions, managements objective is to reduce its exposure to commodity price changes to $0.01 of earnings per diluted share per $0.10 change in the average NYMEX natural gas price for 2002, $0.03 per diluted share for 2003, and less than $0.04 per diluted share for 2004 through 2008. In addition to monetizations, the Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure. The Company has relied almost exclusively on fixed price swaps to accomplish the remainder of this objective during 2001 due to the increased market volatility. Equitable also conducts trading activities through an unregulated marketing group. The function of the trading business is to contribute to earnings by taking market positions within defined limits subject to the Companys corporate risk management policy. These derivatives include forward contracts, which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the difference between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. The Companys management made a strategic decision to limit trading activities during 2001. Newly Issued Accounting Standards: In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, both of which are effective for fiscal year 2002. Statement No. 141 eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill. Under Statement No. 142, goodwill and indefinite intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company has recorded goodwill of $57.4 million at December 31, 2001. 16 Application of the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 is expected to result in an increase in annual net income of approximately $3.7 million. During 2002, the Company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and, therefore, has not yet determined the effect these tests will have on the earnings and financial position of the Company. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which will be effective for fiscal year 2003. This Statement requires asset retirement obligations to be measured at fair value and to be recognized at the time the obligation is incurred. During 2002, management will assess the impact, if any, of this pronouncement on the earnings and financial position of the Company. In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which will be effective for fiscal year 2002. Statement 144 provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale. Based on current circumstances, the Company believes the application of the new rules will not have a material impact on the earnings and financial position of the Company. Consolidated Results of Operations Equitables consolidated net income from continuing operations for 2001 was $151.8 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $106.2 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for 2000 and $69.1 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for 1999. The improved 2001 earnings are due to higher realized selling prices; incremental natural gas production attributable to a full year of production from the acquired Statoil Appalachian oil and gas properties; and lower operating expenses throughout the organization due to continuing process improvement efforts in all significant business units. The improved 2001 earnings were partially offset by unusually warm weather resulting in reduced throughput volumes. Earnings for 2000 increased over 1999 as a result of increased natural gas production; increased throughput in the regulated distribution operations primarily due to colder weather; lower exploration costs; and lower operating and administrative expenses throughout the organization. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Results for the investment in Westport are not attributed to a business segment. Headquarters operating expenses are billed to operating segments based on a fixed allocation of the annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual expenses are not allocated to operating segments. Certain performance related incentive costs and administrative costs totaling $8.0 million and $11.2 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, were not allocated. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Equitable Utilities Equitable Utilities operations comprise the sale and transportation of natural gas to customers at state regulated rates, interstate pipeline transportation and storage of natural gas subject to federal regulation, and the unregulated marketing of natural gas, and limited trading activities. Natural Gas Distribution The local distribution operations of Equitable Gas Company (Equitable Gas) a division of the Company, provides natural gas services in southwestern Pennsylvania and to municipalities in northern West Virginia. In addition, Equitable Gas provides field line sales in eastern Kentucky. Equitable Gas is subject to rate regulation by state regulatory commissions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Gas industry competition at the retail level is receiving increased attention from both regulators and legislators. In June 1999, Pennsylvania enacted into law the Natural Gas Choice and Competition Act (the Act) which required local natural gas distribution companies to extend the availability of natural gas transportation 17 service to residential and commercial customers by July 1, 2000, pursuant to a PUC approved plan. The Company filed a revised tariff after which a negotiated settlement was reached and approved, becoming effective July 1, 2001. In 2001, Equitable Gas made progress with the PUC to provide for performance based rates (PBR) in 2001. On September 26, 2001, the PUC issued a final order that provides a guaranteed purchased gas cost credit to customers, while enabling Equitable Gas to share in any cost savings from more effective management of capacity release and off system sales revenues. This order is effective from October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003. Interstate Pipeline The pipeline operations of Equitrans, L.P. (Equitrans) and Carnegie Interstate Pipeline (Carnegie Pipeline), subsidiaries of the Company, are subject to rate regulation by the FERC. Under present rates, a majority of the annual costs are recovered through fixed charges to customers. Equitrans filed a rate case in April 1997, which addressed the recovery of certain stranded plant costs related to the implementation of FERC Order No. 636. The requested rates were placed into effect in August 1997, subject to refund, pending the issuance of a final order. On April 29, 1999, the FERC approved, without modification, the joint stipulated settlement agreement resolving all issues in the proceeding. The approved settlement provided for prospective collection of increased gathering charges. In addition, the settlement provided Equitrans the opportunity to retain all revenues associated with interruptible transportation and negotiated rate agreements, as well as moving its gathering charge toward a cost based rate. In the second quarter of 1999, Equitrans recorded the final settlement of the rate case. The final settlement includes the adjustment of the prior provisions for refund and recognition of the previously deferred revenues and costs related to the stranding of certain gathering facilities. During 1999, the Company owned a third interstate pipeline, Three Rivers Pipeline Company, which was interconnected with Equitrans. On November 29, 1999, Equitrans filed an application with the FERC to acquire and operate the assets of Three Rivers Pipeline Company that was granted by an order dated April 13, 2000. In July 2001, Equitrans filed an order with the FERC to transfer five natural gas pipeline gathering systems located in West Virginia and Pennsylvania to the Equitable Production business segment. In February 2002, the FERC approved the order that resulted in the transfer of gathering systems. The transfer will be effective January 1, 2002 for segment reporting purposes. The systems transferred consist of approximately 1,300 miles of low pressure, small diameter pipeline, and related facilities used to gather gas from wells in the region. The effect of this transfer is not material to the results of operations or financial position of Equitable Utilities or Equitable Production, and therefore, the results have not been restated for this transfer. Energy Marketing Equitable Utilities unregulated marketing entity provides commodity procurement and delivery, risk management and customer services to energy consumers including large industrial, utility, commercial, institutional and residential end users. This divisions primary focus is to provide products and services in those areas where the Company has a strategic marketing advantage, usually due to geographic coverage and ownership of physical or contractual assets. In conjunction with these activities, the Company also engages in limited trading activity. Equitable Energy uses prudent asset management to optimize the Companys assets through trading activities. Trading activities are entered into with the objective of limiting exposure from shifts in market prices. Capital Expenditures Equitable Utilities forecasts 2002 capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million, a significant increase over capital expenditures of $38.5 million for 2001. The 2002 capital expenditures include 2001 capital commitments totaling $45 million and planned expenditures from 2002 commitments totaling $35 million. The total 2002 expenditures include $46 million for Utilities infrastructure improvements, $23 million for technology enhancements and $11 million for new business development. The infrastructure improvements include maintenance and improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines as well as storage enhancements. The technology expenditures are related to mobilization and automation initiatives while the new business capital is planned for distribution extension projects. 18 Equitable Utilities Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (thousands) OPERATIONAL DATA Operating expenses/net revenues 65.77 % 60.85 % 64.62 % Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 38,528 $ 28,436 $ 43,979 FINANCIAL DATA Utility revenues $ 408,812 $ 377,700 $ 324,869 Marketing revenues 1,032,207 1,009,554 487,005 Total revenues 1,441,019 1,387,254 811,874 Purchased natural gas cost 1,210,277 1,149,775 583,974 Net revenues 230,742 237,479 227,900 Operating and maintenance expense 56,013 59,072 57,844 Selling, general and administrative expense 69,344 57,244 53,819 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) 26,404 28,185 35,596 Total expenses 151,761 144,501 147,259 Operating income $ 78,981 $ 92,978 $ 80,641 Equitable Utilities had operating income of $79.0 million for 2001, compared with $93.0 million for 2000. The lower results for 2001 are primarily due to reduced revenues resulting from warm weather, charges related to pipeline operations workforce reductions, and a charge related to a decision to add a $7.0 million incremental credit related reserve. Operating income for Equitable Utilities increased 15.3% from 1999 to 2000. The increase in 2000 is a result of higher net revenues due principally to the Carnegie acquisition and cooler weather during the heating season. Results for the 2000 period include $0.9 million for the recovery of stranded costs in rates from the previously mentioned Equitrans rate case settlement, which was partially offset by charges of $1.5 million for improvement of utility segment operating processes and consolidation of facilities. Results for 1999 benefited from the recognition of the settlement of Equitrans rate case which included stranded cost recovery that had a positive net result of $3.8 million. This benefit was partially offset by charges of $3.0 million for improvement of utility segment operating processes and consolidation of facilities. Excluding the impact of the rate case settlement and process improvement charges in both periods, operating income increased $13.8 million, or 17.3%, over the $79.7 million in 1999. Distribution Operations Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 OPERATIONAL DATA Degree days (30 year average 5,968) 5,059 5,596 5,485 O&M* per customer $ 296.52 $ 271.94 $ 254.85 Volumes (MMcf): Residential 24,753 27,776 25,431 Commercial and industrial 24,500 32,521 22,209 Total natural gas sales and transportation 49,253 60,297 47,640 * O&M is defined for this calculation as the sum of operating and maintenance and selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding other taxes. 19 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Net revenues $ 154,624 $ 159,818 $ 144,969 Operating expenses 84,276 78,454 73,179 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 18,175 17,411 17,086 Operating income $ 52,173 $ 63,953 $ 54,704 Net revenues for 2001 were $154.6 million compared to $159.9 million in 2000. Heating degree days were 5,059 for 2001, which is 10% warmer than the 5,596 degree days recorded in 2000 and 15% warmer than the 30 year normal of 5,968. The warmer weather had a negative year over year impact on net revenues of approximately $7.8 million, which was partially offset by increased delivery margins. Commercial and industrial volumes declined 25% from prior year primarily due to the economic decline in the domestic steel industry. The negative net revenue impact from warm weather was partially mitigated by an increase in industrial demand charge revenues from new customers and reduced gas costs for non regulated commercial and industrial customers, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2001. Total operating expenses increased $5.8 million, or 7% from $78.5 million in 2000. The increase is attributable to a $7.0 million charge for incremental credit related reserves in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increased operating expenses were partially offset by reduced operations and maintenance expenses related to continued process improvement initiatives. Net revenues for the distribution operations increased 10.3% from 1999 to 2000. The increase in net revenues for 2000 is due principally to the total system throughput increase from the Carnegie Gas acquisition and the impact of weather that was 2% colder than the prior year. Weather in the distribution service territory during 2000 was 6% warmer than the 30 year average. Operating expenses for the distribution operations for 2000 increased 7.2% from 1999. The increase in 2000 is due principally to the acquisition of Carnegie Gas, increased provision for performance related bonuses and higher administrative costs. Pipeline Operations Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (thousands) OPERATIONAL DATA Transportation throughput (MMBtu) 70,693 81,692 76,727 FINANCIAL DATA Net revenues $ 62,079 $ 61,119 $ 73,273 Operating expenses 33,249 29,040 32,607 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 7,872 10,577 18,312 Operating income $ 20,958 $ 21,502 $ 22,354 Net revenues from pipeline operations increased to $62.1 million from $61.1 million in 2000. Pipeline revenues in 2000 include $3.8 million for the recovery of stranded costs in rates from the previously mentioned Equitrans rate case settlement. Excluding the $3.8 million from the settlement in 2000, the net revenues increased 8% from the prior year. This increase is largely associated with the storage related service revenues resulting from improved asset utilization. The 2001 transportation throughput decline in 2001 from prior year of 13% is primarily due to the reduced residential throughput resulting from the warmer weather than prior year and 30 year average. 20 Operating expenses increased by $4.2 million from $29.0 million in 2000. The increased operating expenses are due to the June 2001 and September 2001 charges for workforce reductions and process improvements related to compressor automation totaling $6.0 million. The one time charges were partially offset by reduced operations and maintenance costs associated with the current year workforce reductions and continued process improvement initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expenses for 2000 included $2.9 million of amortization expense related to the recovery of stranded costs in rates. Excluding the amortization expense from 2000, total depreciation and amortization expenses increased minimally due to the 2001 capital expenditure program. Net revenues for the pipeline operations decreased 16.6% from 1999 to 2000. Pipeline revenues in 2000 include $3.8 million for the recovery of stranded costs in rates from the previously mentioned Equitrans rate case settlement. Revenues in 1999 include $17.2 million related to recognition of the rate settlement, pass through of stranded costs and pass through of FERC surcharges and products extraction costs. Excluding the impact of the rate settlement, net revenues increased $1.2 million primarily due to the increased throughput from the Carnegie Interstate Pipeline acquisition and increased gathering and storage services. Operating expenses for the pipeline operations decreased 10.9% from 1999 to 2000. The operating expenses for 2000 include $2.9 million of amortization expense related to the recovery of stranded costs in rates. Operating expenses for 1999 include $11.6 million of amortization expense related to the recovery of stranded costs, $4.0 million for utility segment process improvements and $1.7 million of pass through products extraction costs. Excluding the impact of these items in both periods, operating expenses of $36.0 million for 2000 increased by $2.4 million. The increase in operating expenses for 2000, excluding these items in both periods, was principally due to the acquisition of Carnegie Interstate Pipeline and increased provisions for performance related bonuses. Energy Marketing Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Thousands) OPERATIONAL DATA Marketed gas sales (MMBtu) 215,541 240,922 188,133 Net revenue/MMBtu $ 0.0651 $ 0.0687 $ 0.0513 FINANCIAL DATA Net revenues $ 14,039 $ 16,542 $ 9,658 Operating expenses 7,832 8,822 5,877 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 357 197 198 Operating income $ 5,850 $ 7,523 $ 3,583 Net revenues for energy marketing operations decreased $2.5 million, or 15% from $16.5 million in 2000. The decrease was due to lower per unit margins and an 11% reduction in volumes. The decline in volume is in line with the Companys strategic decision to reduce its trading activities which generally generate low margins and, as a result, are not a significant component of operating income. Operating expenses decreased 11% from 2000 to 2001. The decline in operating expenses is associated with a reduction in workforce due to the strategic decision to limit trading activities in 2001 and from increased investment costs in asset management and retail marketing activities. Net revenues for energy marketing operations increased 71.3%, from 1999 to 2000. The increase in net revenues is attributable to greater sales volumes associated with asset management activities and higher unit margins. In addition, the sale of gas in storage during the first quarter of 2000 allowed the Company to benefit from the increasing natural gas prices. Operating expenses increased 50.1% from 1999 to 2000. The increase in expenses is due principally to the increased investment in the segments asset management and retail marketing activities. 21 Equitable Production Equitable Production develops, produces and sells natural gas and crude oil, with operations in the Appalachian region of the United States. It also engages in natural gas gathering and the processing and sale of natural gas and natural gas liquids. In April 2000, the Company merged its Equitable Production Gulf business with Westport Oil and Gas Company to form Westport Resources Corporation (Westport) in which the Company retains an equity interest. The operations of Equitable Production Gulf through the date of the merger are presented after the operations of Equitable Production (Appalachian). Equitable Production (Appalachian) During calendar 2000, Equitable Production completed several transactions which affects the comparability of the financial data between 2000 and 2001. In February 2000, Equitable Production acquired the Appalachian production assets of Statoil for $630 million plus working capital adjustments for a total of $677 million. Statoils operations consisted of approximately 1,200 billion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves and 6,500 natural gas wells in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Monetizations In December of 2001, the Company sold its oil dominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities. The sale resulted in a decrease in 63 Bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately $60 million. The field produced approximately 3.7 Bcfe annually. The proceeds are shown in the balance sheet as restricted cash. See Note F for additional information related to the restricted cash. Prepaid Natural Gas Sales During 2000, the Company utilized two prepaid natural gas sales transactions in order to limit its exposure to commodity volatility, to reduce counter party risk, and to raise capital. These contracts are based upon energy content or Btu. The Company converts these to their volumetric equivalents or Mcfe using a factor of 1.05 Btu per Mcfe. In December 2000, Equitable sold approximately 26.1 Bcf of future production for proceeds of $104 million. This natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability. Under the terms of this sales contract, the Company must deliver approximately 14,300 Mcf per day for five years starting January 1, 2001. The Company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered. In December 2000, Equitable sold approximately 26.6 Bcf of future production for proceeds of $105 million. This natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability. Under the terms of this sales contract, the Company must deliver approximately 24,300 Mcf per day for three years starting January 1, 2001. The Company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered. Below is a table that details the specifics of the Companys various prepaid transactions as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. Total Contract Volume (Bcf) Contract Term Annual Volume (Bcf) Gathering Fee ($/Mcf) Wellhead Price ($/Mcf) Annual Revenue (Thousands) 26.1 5 years 5.2 $ 0.71 $ 3.28 $ 20,784 26.6 3 years 8.9 $ 0.71 $ 3.23 $ 34,922 22 Sales of Gas Properties Occasionally, the Company enters into a sale of gas properties in order to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility, to reduce counter party risk, eliminate production risk, and to raise capital, while providing the Company market based fees associated with the gathering, marketing, and operation of these producing properties. In June 2000, Equitable sold properties with approximately 66.0 Bcfe of reserves to a partnership, Eastern Seven Partners, L.P. (ESP), for proceeds of $122 million and a retained interest in the partnership. This sale of gas properties reduces the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the partnership which is recorded as Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments under the equity method of accounting. The transaction contains a provision, under certain circumstances, for the Companys equity interest to increase. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver their natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term. As the operator of the gas properties in the partnership, the Company may from time to time have receivables outstanding from ESP of up to $10 million. In December 2000, Equitable sold properties with approximately 133.3 Bcfe of reserves to a trust, Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANPI), for proceeds of $256 million and a retained interest in the trust. This sale of gas properties will reduce the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the trust which is recorded as Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments under the equity method of accounting. The transaction contains a provision, under certain circumstances, for the Companys equity interest to increase. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver their natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term. As the operator of the gas properties and as a result of a separate agreement, the Company receives a market based fee for providing a restricted line of credit to the trust that is limited by the fair market value of their remaining reserves. Below is a table that details the specifics of the Companys various sales of gas properties as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. Sales of Gas Properties Reserves Sold (Bcfe) Volumes Produced (Bcfe) Revenue Recognized from Fees (Thousands) 2001 2000 2001 2000 ESP 66.0 10.3 6.6 $ 8,876 $ 4,913 ANPI 133.3 15.4 $ 16,130 $ In November 1995, the Company monetized Appalachian gas properties qualifying for non conventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, Appalachian Basin Partners (ABP). The Company recorded the proceeds as deferred revenue which was recognized as production occurred. The Company retained a partnership interest in the properties that increases substantially based on the attainment of a performance target. The performance target was met at the end of 2001. Beginning in 2002, the Company will no longer include ABP volumes as monetized sales, but instead as equity production sales. As a result, monetized volumes sold will decrease by approximately 8.9 Bcf while equity production will increase by the same amount. The Company will consolidate the partnership starting in 2002, and the remaining portion not owned by the Company will result in a minority interest. The Company will also begin receiving a greater percentage of the non conventional fuels tax credit based on its increased ownership. Capital Expenditures Equitable Production forecasts the 2002 capital budget to be approximately $107 million. This includes $84 million for development of Appalachian holdings, $16 million for improvements to gathering system pipelines, and $7 million for technology initiatives. This forecasted level of development drilling is designed to allow for supply volumes to remain consistent with 2001 levels. The evaluation of new development locations, market forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering system investments. 23 Equitable Production (Appalachian) Operational and Financial Data Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 OPERATIONAL DATA Production: Net equity sales, natural gas and equivalents (MMcfe) 38,825 66,356 30,844 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.67 $ 3.06 $ 2.30 Monetized sales (MMcfe) (a) 22,845 11,105 11,819 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.81 $ 2.04 $ 1.85 Company usage (MMcfe) 5,742 6,568 3,232 Lease operating expense (LOE), excluding severance tax ($/Mcfe) $ 0.32 $ 0.33 $ 0.33 Severance tax ($/Mcfe) $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.09 Depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 0.38 $ 0.49 $ 0.42 Production Services: Gathered volumes (MMcfe) 106,832 92,440 49,396 Average gathering fee ($/Mcfe) (b) $ 0.58 $ 0.58 $ 0.59 Gathering and compression expense ($/Mcfe) $ 0.23 $ 0.27 $ 0.33 Gathering and compression depreciation ($/Mcfe) $ 0.10 $ 0.11 $ 0.15 Total operated volumes (MMcfe) (c) 93,167 89,932 45,896 Volumes handled (MMcfe) (d) 119,874 101,889 58,196 Selling, general, and administrative ($/Mcfe handled) $ 0.20 $ 0.23 $ 0.33 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 93,862 $ 84,661 $ 29,155 (a) Volumes sold associated with the Companys two prepaid natural gas sales contracts and the ABP partnership discussed above. (b) Revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect, process and deliver natural gas from the field where it is produced, to the trunk or main transmission line. Many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price. In this case the Company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components. (c) Includes equity volumes, monetized volumes, and volumes in which interests were sold, but which the Company still operates for a fee. (d) Includes operated volumes plus volumes gathered for third parties. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Thousands) FINANCIAL DATA Revenue from Production $ 229,344 $ 225,774 $ 92,680 Services: Revenue from gathering fees 61,475 53,268 29,178 Other revenues 11,459 10,120 4,152 Total revenues 302,278 289,162 126,010 Operating expenses: Gathering and compression expenses 24,594 25,237 16,424 Lease operating expense 21,855 27,893 15,009 Severance tax 10,640 13,103 3,977 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 40,624 57,175 29,141 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 24,556 23,470 19,034 Exploration and dry hole expense 2,005 2,896 1,891 Strike related expenses 18,694 Total operating expenses 124,274 168,468 85,476 Equity from nonconsolidated investments 726 167 Other loss (6,951 ) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) $ 178,730 $ 113,910 $ 40,534 24 Revenues from production, which are derived primarily from the sale of produced natural gas, increased slightly from 2000 to 2001. The increase in revenues from production of $4 million from 2000 to 2001 is due primarily to higher effective commodity prices offset by the June and December 2000 sale of gas properties (20.3 Bcfe), increases in sales volumes due to a full year ownership of the Statoil assets (4.3 Bcfe), and production from wells shut in or damaged during a fourth quarter 2000 work stoppage (1.4 Bcfe). Equitable Productions average selling prices for natural gas increased 28% over the same period. The revenue from gathering fees increased 15% primarily due to the increase in gathered volumes, consistent with the increase in sales volumes noted above from the Statoil assets and absence of a work stoppage in 2001. The gathering fee increases were not offset by the June and December 2000 asset sales, as the production from these wells is still gathered and compressed by the Company. Other revenues increased by 13% due to increased service fees from the 2000 sales of gas properties. Operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2001 decreased 26% from the same period in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in operating costs related to the sale of gas properties to a partnership and a trust discussed above. Additional positive items included the absence of strike related expenses incurred in 2000, lower depletion expense and operating improvements in the Kentucky West pipeline unit offset by increased operating expenses due to full year ownership of Statoil assets. Gathering and compression expenses per Mcfe decreased 15% due to operating improvements in the Kentucky West pipeline unit and lower cost gathering on the acquired assets. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe declined 13% due to on going synergies from the acquisition and increase in gathering system throughput. Depletion expense was reduced both in total and on a per unit basis as a result of the production asset sales in calendar 2000. Revenues from production increased 143.6% from 1999 to 2000. The increase in revenues from production of $133.1 million from 1999 to 2000 is due primarily to increases in sales volumes related to the Statoil acquisition and higher effective commodity prices. The Statoil acquisition added 32.1 Bcfe of sales in 2000. Equitable Productions average selling prices for natural gas increased 33.0% over the same period. The increase in revenues realized was reduced by the recognition of $77.6 million in hedge losses. The revenue from gathering fees increased 82.6% primarily due to the increase in gathered volumes related to the Statoil acquisition. Other revenues increased by $6.0 million due to the sale of non conventional fuels tax credits acquired from Statoil and from service fee recoveries. Operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2000 totaled $168.5 million, an increase of $83.0 million from the same period in 1999, with the increase due primarily to the Statoil acquisition. Gathering and compression expenses per Mcfe decreased 18.2% due to lower cost gathering on the acquired assets. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe declined 30.3% due to initial synergies from the acquisitions. Severance taxes per Mcfe increased due to increased natural gas sales prices. On December 10, 2000, a labor situation involving the Kentucky West Virginia unit of the Equitable Production segment and members of the local PACE labor union was settled, after a 56 day strike which had curtailed production in the region. The agreement reached between the Company and the union resulted in a decrease in the represented work force in this unit by 85 people. This reduction from 152 to 67 employees resulted in a fourth quarter charge of $18.7 million, recorded as operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated income statement. Cost savings from the labor settlement were approximately $5.0 million in 2001. Equitable Production Gulf As described above, the Equitable Production Gulf operations were merged into Westport effective April 1, 2000. As such, there is no activity for the Production Gulf Operation in 2001. The following description includes results prior to the merger. During 2000, seven gross wells were drilled at a success rate of 86%. In the Gulf Region during 1999, 153 gross wells were drilled at a success rate of 82%. This activity resulted in additions of 48.5 Bcfe. The increase was the result of successful development of the West Cameron Block 180 and 198 fields and South Marsh Island 39 field. Equitable Production Gulf operated both fields. Equitable Production also participated in exploratory activity during 1999, including a successful well at South Timbalier 196, in which Equitable Production had a 50% working interest. Unsuccessful exploratory activity during 1999 on the West Cameron 575 and the Eugene Island 44 blocks resulted in dry hole expense of approximately $2.5 million in 1999. 25 Production Gulf Operation Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 (Thousands) OPERATIONAL DATA Production: Net sales, natural gas and equivalents (MMcfe) 6,087 26,853 Average sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 2.77 $ 2.34 LOE ($/Mcfe) $ 0.24 $ 0.25 SG&A ($/Mcfe) $ 0.27 $ 0.26 Depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 1.11 $ 1.07 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 9,034 $ 62,944 FINANCIAL DATA Revenue from Production $ 16,885 $ 64,050 Other revenues 70 844 Total revenues 16,955 64,894 Gathering and compression expense 17 155 Lease operating expense 1,454 6,868 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 6,891 29,424 Selling, general and administrative expense 1,643 6,969 Exploration and dry hole expense 524 7,396 Total operating expenses $ 10,529 $ 50,812 EBIT $ 6,426 $ 14,082 Results of operations for the Gulf in 2000 include only the first quarter. During that period, revenues per Mcfe increased 18% over the full year 1999 average, due to increased commodity prices. Sales volumes decreased due to the faster decline of Gulf production and decreased drilling during 2000. Operating expenses per unit were essentially unchanged from 1999.

Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 OPERATIONAL DATA Revenue backlog at December 31 (Thousands) $ 128,264 $ 90,978 $ 70,999 Gross profit margin 22.0 % 24.8 % 21.5 % SG&A as a % of revenue 14.7 % 17.0 % 11.7 % Development expense as a % of revenue 2.6 % 3.3 % 2.6 % Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 289 $ 1,596 $ 6,041 26 Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Thousands) FINANCIAL DATA Energy service contracting revenues $ 157,379 $ 134,620 $ 169,633 Energy service contract cost 122,790 101,266 133,088 Gross margin 34,589 33,354 36,545 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 23,112 22,873 19,889 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 5,952 5,304 6,078 Total operating expenses 29,064 28,177 25,967 Operating income 5,525 5,177 10,578 Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments 7,555 5,109 2,863 Earnings before interest and taxes $ 13,080 $ 10,286 $ 13,441 Revenue backlog increased to $128.3 million at year end 2001 from $91.0 million at year end 2000. The increase in backlog is primarily attributable to an increase in federal government contracts. Substantially all the backlog is expected to be completed within the next 18 months. Total construction completed during 2001 was $103.0 million versus $85.1 million in 2000, an increase of $17.9 million over 2000. This increase was primarily due to the increased construction backlog at the beginning of 2001 versus the beginning of 2000. Revenues increased from 2000 to 2001 by $22.8 million, or 16.9%, due primarily to the increase in construction backlog at the beginning of 2001 versus the beginning of 2000. Gross margins decreased to 22.0% in 2001 from 24.8% in 2000, reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year. Gross margins have trended downwards slightly over the past three years due to competitive pressures. The gross margin in 1999 was 21.5%. SG&A expenses were flat from 2000 to 2001. Included in SG&A expenses in 2001 were $1.4 million related to office consolidations in the third quarter. Included in SG&A expenses in 2000 were $1.0 million related to the decision to discontinue developing international energy infrastructure projects and $0.4 million of additional costs related to the closing of three unprofitable energy services contracting offices in the northwest United States. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased from 2000 to 2001 by $0.6 million, or 12.2%. This increase is primarily due to increased DD&A for power plant projects. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $7.6 million in 2001 and $5.1 million in 2000 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets. The increase in earnings was primarily due to improved earnings in the power plants in Panama. Revenue backlog increased to $91.0 million at year end 2000 from $71.0 million at year end 1999. The increase in backlog was attributable to an increase in the energy infrastructure project backlog. Total construction completed during 2000 was $85.1 million versus $151.7 million, a decrease of $66.6 million over 1999. This decrease was primarily due to a $45 million decrease in construction of energy infrastructure projects in 1999. Revenues decreased from 1999 to 2000 by $35.0 million, or 20.6%, primarily caused by low construction backlog at the beginning of 2000 versus the beginning of 1999. Gross margins increased to 24.8% in 2000 from 21.5% in 1999, reflecting a focus on higher margin products and services and a gross profit increase in a few operational energy services projects. 27 SG&A expenses increased from 1999 to 2000 by $3.0 million. Increases during 2000 included $1.0 million related to the decision to discontinue developing international energy infrastructure projects and the costs associated with the integrating of this division with the energy services contracting division. Other costs include $0.4 million of additional costs related to the closing of three unprofitable energy services contracting offices in the Northwest United States. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense decreased from 1999 to 2000 by $0.8 million, or 12.7%. This decrease was primarily due to a write down of computer software development in 1999. Equity income from nonconsolidated investments of $5.1 million in 2000 and $2.9 million in 1999 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets, primarily a 50 mega watt facility in Panama, which is 50% owned by the Company. A 96 mega watt facility in Panama and a 7 mega watt facility in Providence, RI were brought on line in late 1999. Other Income Statement Items Other Income Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Thousands) Other income (loss): Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ 26,101 $ 25,161 $ 2,863 Gain on sale of Westport stock 6,561 Other loss (6,951 ) Total other income $ 26,101 $ 24,771 $ 2,863 Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments increased in 2001 due to the favorable performance of the NORESCO segments investments in several independent power plant projects. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments increased in 2000 primarily due to the equity earnings from the Companys ownership in Westport Resources Corporation (Westport). In October 2000, Westport completed an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares. Equitable sold 1.325 million shares in this IPO for an after tax gain of $4.3 million. This reduced the Companys ownership to approximately 36% interest in Westport. On August 21, 2001, Westport Resources completed a merger with Belco Oil & Gas. Equitable continues to own 13.911 million shares, which now represents approximately 27% of Westports total shares outstanding at December 31, 2001. Equitables equity in Westport was $148.1 million as of December 31, 2001. On June 30, 2000, Equitable sold a substantial portion of gas properties which qualified for nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership which netted $122.2 million in cash and retained a minority interest in the partnership. In anticipation of this transaction, the Company had previously entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production. Removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a $7.0 million pretax charge recorded as other loss. Interest Charges Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Thousands) Interest charges $ 41,098 $ 75,661 $ 37,132 Interest costs decreased in 2001 as a result of a $472 million decrease in average short term debt outstanding, due to the reduction in short term debt originally extended to finance the Statoil acquisition in February of 2000, and subsequently extinguished with the proceeds from the two prepaid natural gas sales and the sale of natural gas properties discussed above. 28 Interest costs increased in 2000 as a result of the Statoil acquisition which increased average debt outstanding by $580 million. The outstanding debt was reduced significantly during the fourth quarter by the proceeds received from the two prepaid gas forward sales, the sale of gas properties. Interest expense also increased as a result of higher interest rates in 2000 compared to 1999. Average annual interest rates on short term debt were 4.1%, 6.4%, and 5.2% for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities were $129.9 million in 2001 compared to $361.2 million in 2000 and $154.3 million in 1999. Excluding the $209.3 million cash received in December 2000 from the two prepaid natural gas sales, cash flows from operations decreased $22.0 million. Net income increased $45.6 million over 2000, which was attributed to higher commodity prices throughout the first three quarters of 2001. Depletion expense was lower than prior year primarily due to the two term interest sales of oil and gas properties in 2000 while deferred income tax expense was slightly higher over prior year. In addition, increased monetized production revenue recognition was included in net income that did not affect operating cash flows. Equitable Utilities Distribution and Energy Marketing operations had decreased accounts receivable and deferred purchased gas costs due to the warmer weather, reduced trading activity, and lower commodity prices late in 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. This positive operating cash flow effect was partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable and the increase in inventory also attributable to the circumstances mentioned above. As discussed above, the Company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales during 2000 and a monetization in 1995. Revenue is recognized from these transactions as the natural gas is delivered to the purchasing parties. As the actual cash receipts for these transactions took place at the contract inception, any amounts recognized in income are a non cash item and is included as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. These amounts were $84.5 million, $13.7 million, and $13.0 million as of December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were $125.8 million in 2001 compared to $363.0 million in 2000 and $137.5 million in 1999. Cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $63.0 million of proceeds from the oil dominated fields sale. At year end, the $63.0 million proceeds remained in a restricted escrow account, which offset the cash inflow. Cash used in investing activities in 2000 primarily includes the acquisition of Statoil properties for $677 million and the increase in equity in nonconsolidated investments due to the Westport merger partially offset by the net proceeds received from the sales of producing properties and from the Gulf asset merger with Westport. The Company expended approximately $132.7 million in 2001 compared to $123.7 million in 2000 and $102.0 million in 1999 for capital expenditures. These expenditures in all years represented growth projects in the Equitable Production segment, and replacements, improvements and additions to plant assets in the Equitable Utilities and NORESCO units. Equitable Production expended $93.9 million in 2001 primarily for development of the Appalachian region, gathering system pipeline improvements and technology initiatives. NORESCO expended $0.3 million for leasehold improvements and equipment additions and replacements. The Equitable Utilities segment expended $38.5 million primarily for distribution plant additions and replacements and technology improvements. A total of $166 million has been authorized for the 2002 capital expenditure program, as previously described in the business segment results. The Company expects to finance this program with cash generated from operations and with short term loans. 29 In December 1999, the Company acquired the Carnegie Companies for $40 million, including natural gas distribution, pipeline, exploration and production operations. Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities were $26.5 million in 2001 compared to cash flows provided of $35.8 million in 2000 and cash flows used of $101.2 million in 1999. Throughout 2001, Equitable reduced its short term debt and bought back shares of its outstanding common stock, as further described below, with cash provided by operating activities. In addition, NORESCO received project financing loans of $105.4 million against its current construction contracts. It is expected that many of the contracts underlying this financing will be sold in 2002. During the first quarter of 2001, a Jamaican energy infrastructure project, which is among the consolidated subsidiaries, experienced defaults relating to various loan covenants. Consequently, the Company reclassified the nonrecourse project financing from long term debt to current liabilities. The Company is currently working on various alternatives to refinance or restructure the debt or to pursue strategic alternatives for the potential transfer or sale of the Companys project interests. The Company continued its stock buyback activities in 2001. Total shares authorized for repurchase under these activities was increased to 18.8 million in 2001. Total purchases under these activities of 12.3 million shares include 1.8 million shares of stock repurchased in 2001 for $61.2 million, and 1.2 million shares of stock repurchased in 2000 for $29.5 million. Cash generated in all years was partially offset by the payment of the Companys dividends on common shares, which for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $40.4 million, $38.5 million and $40.4 million, respectively. In July 1999, the Company repaid $75.0 million of 7 1/2% debentures, using cash proceeds received in 1998 from the sale of its natural gas midstream operations. Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. Short term loans are used to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season. The Company has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing requirements. Bank loans and commercial paper, supported by available credit, are used to meet short term financing requirements. Interest rates on these short term loans averaged 4.1% during 2001. The Company maintains a revolving credit agreement providing $325 million of available credit, and a 364 day credit agreement providing $325 million of available credit, with a group of banks that expire in 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has the authority and credit backing to support a $650 million commercial paper program. Certain Trading Activities Accounted for at Fair Value Below is a table that presents maturities and the fair valuation source for the Companys derivative commodity instruments that are held for trading purposes as of December 31, 2001.

Since it is primarily a natural gas company, this leads to different approaches to hedging natural gas than for crude oil and natural gas liquids. With respect to hedging the Companys exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices, under current market conditions managements objective is to reduce its exposure to commodity price changes to $0.01 per diluted share per $0.10 change in the average NYMEX natural gas price for 2002, $0.03 per diluted share for 2003, and less than $0.04 per diluted share for 2004 through 2008. In addition to monetizations, the Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure. The Company has relied almost exclusively on fixed price swaps to accomplish the remainder of this objective during 2001 due to the increased market volatility. Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments The Company, within the NORESCO segment, has equity ownership interests in independent power plant (IPP) projects located domestically and in selected international countries. Long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) are signed with the customer whereby they agree to purchase the energy generated by the plant. The length of these contracts ranges from 5 to 30 years. The Company invested approximately $0.1 million and $1.6 million in these operations in 2001 and 2000, respectively, with a total cumulative investment of $42.7 million. The Companys share of the earnings for 2001 and 2000 related to the total investment was $7.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These projects generally are financed on a project basis with nonrecourse financings established at the subsidiary level. During the 2001 second quarter, a domestic energy infrastructure project, included within Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments, experienced a performance default on a creditors agreement. The creditors agreed to temporarily delay enforcement of their remedies to provide an opportunity for resolution of the default. The Company fully reserved for this project during the second quarter 2001. A global settlement agreement was executed in October 2001, and in January 2002, as a result of the consummation of an asset transfer transaction the note was satisfied and debt extinguished. 31 NORESCO owns a 50% interest in a Panamanian thermal electric generation project. The project had previously agreed to retrofit the plant to conform to applicable environmental noise standards by a target date of August 31, 2001. Unforeseen events have continued to extend the final completion date of the required retrofits. The project has obtained an extension from the creditor sponsor until September 2, 2002. The Company has also received an extension from the Panamanian regulators until May 30, 2002. The Company intends to obtain all extensions required in the event the completion of the required retrofits is further delayed. In April 2000, the Company merged its Gulf of Mexico operations with Westport Oil and Gas Company for $50 million in cash and approximately 49% interest in the combined company, named Westport Resources Corporation (Westport). In October 2000, Westport completed an IPO of its shares. Equitable sold 1.325 million shares in this IPO for an after tax gain of $4.3 million, leaving Equitable with a total of 13.911 million shares, or approximately 36% interest in Westport. On August 21, 2001, Westport completed a merger with Belco Oil & Gas. Equitable continues to own 13.911 million shares, which now represent 27% of Westports total shares outstanding at December 31, 2001. The fair market value of Equitables investment in Westport was $241.3 million as of December 31, 2001. During 2000, Equitable Production sold gas properties with approximately 199 Bcfe in reserves located in the Appalachian Basin region of the United States in two transactions which resulted it retaining a 1% minority interest in each of the resulting partnership and trust. Both of these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Stock Split On April 19, 2001, the Board of Directors of Equitable Resources declared a two for one stock split payable on June 11, 2001 to shareholders of record on May 11, 2001. Earnings per share of common stock and weighted average common shares outstanding have been adjusted for the two for one stock split. Acquisitions and Dispositions In February 2000, the Company acquired the Appalachian production assets of Statoil for $630 million plus working capital adjustments for a total of $677 million. The Company initially funded this acquisition through commercial paper, which was replaced by a combination of financings and cash from asset sales. In April 2000, the Company merged Equitable Production Gulf with Westport Oil and Gas Company based in Denver, Colorado, in exchange for $50.0 million and a 49% ownership interest in the combined entity, Westport Resources Corporation (Westport). In October 2000, Westport completed an initial public offering in which Equitable sold 1.325 million shares and reduced its ownership percentage to approximately 36%. On August 21, 2001, Westport completed a merger with Belco Oil & Gas. Equitable continues to own 13.911 million shares, which now represent 27% of Westports total shares outstanding at December 31, 2001. The fair market value of Equitables investment in Westport was $241.3 million as of December 31, 2001 on a pretax basis. In June 2000, Equitable sold properties which contained approximately 66.0 Bcfe of reserves that qualified for nonconventional fuels tax credits to a partnership which netted $122.2 million in cash and a retained minority interest in this partnership. The proceeds received were used to pay down short term debt associated with the Statoil acquisition. Prior to the transaction, the Company entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production. Removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a $7.0 million pretax charge recorded as other loss. Equitable accounts for its remaining $26.2 million investment under the equity method of accounting. Equitable estimates that it will receive $6.0 million in fees for operating the wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the purchaser in 2002 based on expected production volumes. In December 2000, Equitable sold properties, previously acquired from Statoil, with approximately 133.3 Bcfe of reserves to a trust for proceeds of $255.8 million and a retained minority interest in the trust. In anticipation of this transaction, the Company had previously entered into financial hedges. Removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a $57.7 million charge that was offset against the gain recognized on the sale of these properties. The proceeds received were used to pay down short term debt associated with the Statoil 32 acquisition. Equitable accounts for its $36.2 million investment under the equity method of accounting. Equitable estimates that it will receive $12.0 million in fees for operating the wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the trust in 2002 based on expected production volumes. In 2000, the Company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales contracts for 52.7 MMcf of reserves. The Company is required to sell and deliver certain quantities of natural gas during the term of the contracts. The first contract is for five years with net proceeds of $104.0 million. The second contract is for three years with net proceeds of $104.8 million. These contracts were recorded as prepaid gas forward sales and are being recognized in income as deliveries occur. In December 2001, the Company sold its oil dominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities. The sale resulted in a decrease in 63 Bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately $60 million. The field produced approximately 3.7 Bcfe annually. The proceeds are shown in the balance sheet as restricted cash. See Note F for additional information related to the restricted cash. Rate Regulation Accounting for the operations of Equitables Utilities segment is in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. As described in Note A and H to the consolidated financial statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of deferred costs. Schedule of Certain Contractual Obligations Below is a table that details the future projected payments for the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001. Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (Thousands) Interest expense $ 708,063 $ 31,755 $ 87,959 $ 55,141 $ 533,208 Long term debt 287,946 44,800 13,000 230,146 Unconditional purchase obligations 184,738 19,195 56,608 35,404 73,531 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,180,747 $ 50,950 $ 189,367 $ 103,545 $ 836,885 Equitable and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that affect their operations. Governmental authorities may enforce these laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties, assessment and remediation requirements and injunctions as to future activities. Management does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have a material effect on Equitables financial position or results of operations. The Company has identified situations that require remedial action for which approximately $8.0 million is included in other long term liabilities at December 31, 2001. Environmental matters are described in Note V to the consolidated financial statements. 33 At the end of the useful life of a well the Company is required to remediate the site by plugging and abandoning the well. Costs associated with this obligation were $0.7 million in both 2001 and 2000. Inflation and the Effect of Changing Energy Prices The rate of inflation in the United States has been moderate over the past several years and has not significantly affected the profitability of the Company. In prior periods of high general inflation, oil and natural gas prices generally increased at comparable rates; however, there is no assurance that this will be the case in the current environment or in possible future periods of high inflation. Regulated utility operations would be required to file a general rate case in order to recover higher costs of operations. Margins in the energy marketing business in the Equitable Utilities segment are highly sensitive to competitive pressures and may not reflect the effects of inflation. The results of operations in the Companys three business segments will be affected by future changes in oil and natural gas prices and the interrelationship between oil, natural gas and other energy prices. Audit Committee The Audit Committee, composed entirely of outside directors, meets periodically with Equitables independent auditors and management to review the Companys financial statements and the results of audit activities. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to the Board of Directors on the results of its review and recommends the selection of independent auditors. Transactions with Directors Companies During 2001, Equitable Resources conducted business with PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), where Mr. James E. Rohr, an Equitable Resources Director, serves as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The Company paid PNC a total of $521,675 in fees in 2001 for various services, including commitment fees for a line of credit in which PNC participates, treasury management fees, and trust fees. Also during 2001, the Companys pension plan for hourly employees paid BlackRock, Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of PNC, $117,555 in fees for investment management services. All of these transactions were on arms length, fair terms and Mr. Rohr did not have a direct or indirect material interest in these transactions. In the course of ordinary business, The Company may have other transactions with companies and organizations for which an Equitable Resources director serves as an officer. Those directors did not have a material interest in any such transactions and none of those transactions exceeded 5% of the gross revenues of either Equitable Resources or the other organization. Moreover, any such transactions were entered into on arms length, fair terms. 34 Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas which can affect the operating results of Equitable through the Equitable Production segment and the unregulated marketing group within the Equitable Utilities segment. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Note B to the consolidated financial statements. The Company uses simple, nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. For commodity price derivatives used to hedge forecasted Company production, Equitable sets policy limits relative to expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk. The level of price exposure is limited by the value at risk limits allowed by this policy. Volumes associated with future activities, such as new drilling, recompletions and acquisitions, are not eligible for hedging. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. In general, Equitables strategy is to become more highly hedged at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels. For commodity price derivatives held for trading positions, the marketing group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits. In general, this marketing group considers profit opportunities in both physical and financial positions, and Equitables policies apply equally thereto. These financial instruments include forward contracts, which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. With respect to the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2001, the Company continued to execute its hedging strategy by utilizing price swaps with volumes of approximately 196.4 Bcf of natural gas. These derivatives have hedged expected equity production through 2008. A decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2001 levels would increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately $69.3 million. With respect to derivative contracts held by the Company for trading purposes as of December 31, 2001, a decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2001 level would increase the fair market value by approximately $4.2 million. The above analysis of the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk, and as applicable, anticipated transactions occur as expected. The disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. If the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the energy derivatives, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. The Company has variable rate short term debt. As such, there is some limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the Company under its current capital structure. 35
