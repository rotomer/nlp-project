Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon Equitables consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its 17 consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Asset Impairment: The Company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable. The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (Statement No. 144) in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. This Statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying value, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a "critical accounting estimate" as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, because it requires management to make assumptions about cash flows over future years. These assumptions impact the amount of an impairment, which would have an impact on the income statement. Managements assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to do so in the future. The Company reviewed its assets relating to a Jamaican power plant project during the second quarter of 2002, as the project had not been operating at expected levels and repeated remediation efforts were unsuccessful. Additionally, the future projections demonstrated that the losses associated with the assets were likely to continue. The Company determined, through its analysis that an impairment existed. As part of the impairment analysis, the Company performed a probability cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and compared this amount to the carrying value of the asset. The probability cash flows result in a lower fair value than the carrying value, and an impairment was deemed necessary. An impairment of $5.3 million was recorded and represents the full value of NORESCOs investment in the project. Actual results of the Jamaican power plant project have supported the impairment analysis as performance continues to decline, causing on going operations to be in doubt. Notwithstanding the write down of the investment to zero, because the Jamaican power plant is part of the Companys consolidated financial statements, it will continue to record any losses from operations despite the nonrecourse nature of the related debt. Goodwill: Beginning in fiscal year 2002, goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," (Statement No. 142). This statement requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired. Step one is to test for potential impairment, which requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value. If the fair value is higher than the book value, no impairment occurs. If the fair value is lower than the book value, step two must be performed. Step two requires measurement of the amount of impairment loss, if any, and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. The resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment must be recorded. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill impairment is a "critical accounting estimate" because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and these changes could cause a material impact to the income statement. Managements assumptions about discount rates, inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions, such as NORESCOs expected growth rate, require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and anticipated future revenues. Additionally, Statement No. 142 requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated. 18 As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill recorded at the NORESCO segment was analyzed for impairment with the implementation of Statement No. 142. The fair value of the Companys goodwill was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information. Based on the analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value recorded for the goodwill. Therefore, the Company recognized an impairment. During the first quarter of 2002, the implied fair value of the goodwill, using the discounted cash flows methodology, was $51.8 million. The carrying value of the goodwill was $57.3 million, resulting in an after tax impairment charge of $5.5 million In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required. Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 142, the Company assessed the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value might not be recoverable. No such events or indicators occurred, as prescribed by previous accounting guidance, which required the Company to perform such an assessment. Allowance for Bad Debts: The Companys Utility segment encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable. As such, Equitable Utilities records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision, Equitable Utilities primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable "write offs" as a percentage of total revenue. This historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis. Periodically, the reserve is reviewed for reasonableness. The historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather. Both of these items ultimately impact the customers ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the pass through of purchased gas costs to the customers. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a "critical accounting estimate" because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital. The actual weather, commodity prices, and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from managements assumptions and may impact expected earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Additionally, management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. During 2001, $23 million in overdue accounts receivable were reclassified as a regulatory asset. This was due to rate relief allowed Equitable for certain regulated customers severely impacted by the higher rates and colder weather experienced in early 2001. During early 2001, Equitable Gas increased its write off percentage by 1% of revenues, based on the increase in bad debts due to higher bills and colder weather. Performance Plan: The Company accounts for stock based compensation awards under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. The Company treats its performance plan as a variable plan, under which grants were awarded in 2002. The actual cost to be recorded for the plan will not be known until settlement, which is in January 2005, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized. The number of shares to be awarded ranges from 0 to 286,000, depending upon attainment of certain performance goals. In the current period, the Company estimated that the performance measures would be met at the full value of 286,000 shares. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the performance plan is a "critical accounting estimate" because it is highly likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the shares and the level of performance by the employees involved. Additionally, the impact on the Statement of Consolidated Income could be material. Managements assumptions about future 19 stock price and the amount of stock to ultimately be awarded requires significant judgment due to the volatility of the stock market. Pension Plans: The calculation of the Companys net periodic benefit cost (pension expense) and benefit obligation (pension liability) associated with its defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) requires the use of a number of assumptions that the Company deems to be "critical accounting estimates." Changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. The Company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. The expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. The Company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the Company at that time, including the pension plans investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities. The pension plans investment mix as of January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2003 approximated 60% equities and 40% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with Statement No. 87. Although the long term rate is intended to be fairly consistent, the Company has reevaluated and reduced the rate in both 2002 and 2003. The expected long term rates of return determined by the Company as of January 1, 2002 and 2003 totaled 9.75% and 8.75%, respectively. Pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases. Therefore, had the Company assumed an expected long term rate of return of 8.75% as of January 1, 2002, the Companys pension expense for 2002, excluding the effect of any settlements paid during this period, would have been approximately $1.0 million higher than the amount recorded. The assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled. In estimating that rate, Statement No. 87 requires and the Company looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. The Company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of 7.00% and 7.50% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 0.5% (from 7.00% to 6.50%) would increase the Companys projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2002 by approximately $4.2 million. Additionally, had the Companys discount rate decreased to 6.50% as of December 31, 2002, the Companys pension expense for 2003 would be projected to decrease by approximately $0.1 million as a significant portion of the pension plans participants are retirees. Consolidated Results of Operations Equitables consolidated net income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2002 was $150.6 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, compared with $151.8 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, for 2001, and $106.2 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for 2000. The 2002 earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased 1% from 2001 due to the decreased equity earnings in nonconsolidated investments primarily related to the Companys investment in Westport, lower realized selling prices, increased benefit costs, and an impairment on the Jamaica power plant project. These factors were mostly offset by reduced expenses from prior year initiatives and process improvements, lower income tax expense, increased drilling, production enhancements, cooler weather and increased commercial and industrial sales. The 2001 earnings were improved from 2000 due to higher realized selling prices; incremental natural gas production attributable to a full year of production from the acquired Statoil Appalachian oil and gas properties; and lower operating expenses throughout the organization due to continuing 20 process improvement efforts in all significant business units. The improved 2001 earnings were partially offset by unusually warm weather resulting in reduced throughput volumes. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Results for the investment in Westport are not attributed to a business segment. Headquarters operating expenses are billed to operating segments based on a fixed allocation of the annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual expenses are not allocated to operating segments. Certain performance related incentive costs and administrative costs totaling $5.4 million and $8.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, were not allocated. Equitable Utilities Equitable Utilities operations comprise the sale and transportation of natural gas to customers at state regulated rates, interstate pipeline transportation and storage of natural gas subject to federal regulation, the unregulated marketing of natural gas, and limited trading activities. Natural Gas Distribution The local distribution operation of Equitable Gas, a division of the Company, provides natural gas services in southwestern Pennsylvania and to municipalities and other customers in northern West Virginia. In addition, Equitable Gas provides field line sales (also referred to as "farm tap" service) in eastern Kentucky. Equitable Gas is subject to rate regulation by state regulatory commissions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Over the last two years Equitable Gas has been working with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performance based rate making. In 2001, Equitable Gas received approval from the PUC to implement a performance based incentive that provides customers a guaranteed purchased gas cost credit for transportation, while enabling Equitable to retain any cost savings in excess of the credit through more effective management of upstream interstate pipeline capacity. During the third quarter 2002, the PUC approved a one year extension of this program through September 2004. In that same order, the PUC approved a second performance based initiative related to balancing services. This initiative runs through 2005. In the second quarter 2002, the PUC authorized Equitable Gas to offer a sales service that would give residential and small business customers the alternative to fix the unit cost of the commodity portion of their rate for one year. The program was developed in response to customer requests for a method to reduce the fluctuation in gas costs. This "first of its kind" program in Pennsylvania is another in a series of service enhancing initiatives implemented by Equitable Gas. The Company is currently preparing to offer this sales service to its residential and small business customers. The Company plans to propose additional performance based initiatives, which will require PUC approval, that will advance new incentive mechanisms for managing commodity costs, reducing operating expense, optimizing cost of capital, and reducing gas line loss. In the third quarter 2002, the PUC issued an order approving Equitable Gas request for a Delinquency Reduction Opportunity Program. The program gives incentives to eligible customers to make payments exceeding their current bill amount and receive additional credits from Equitable Gas to reduce the customers delinquent balance. The program will be fully funded through customer contributions and a surcharge in rates. Equitable Gas makes quarterly purchased gas cost filings with the PUC that are subject to annual and quarterly reviews and annual audits by the PUC. The PUC completed its last audit in 2001, which approved the Companys purchased gas costs through 1999. The Companys purchased gas costs for 21 2000, 2001 and 2002 are currently unaudited by the PUC, but have received final prudency review by the PUC through 2001. Equitable Gas is in the process of implementing a new customer information and billing system for which it has incurred $6.5 million of capital expenditures from project inception through December 31, 2002. Based upon the information currently available to management, the implementation of this system is expected to be successfully completed by the end of 2003. Total capital expenditures for this project are expected to significantly exceed the original estimate. Though the project will exceed the original estimate, no impairment has been recognized, as the Company believes that all costs related to the project are recoverable and will have future benefit to the Company. Interstate Pipeline The interstate pipeline operations of Equitrans and Carnegie Pipeline are subject to rate regulation by the FERC. Equitrans last rate case was filed in 1997. The rate case was resolved through a FERC approved settlement among all parties. The settlement provided, with certain limited exceptions, that Equitrans must file a general rate increase application to take effect no later than August 1, 2003. Equitrans has been in discussions with its customers concerning various options related to the requirement to file a rate case, including eliminating the requirement through further rate settlement among the parties. In the second quarter 2002, Equitrans filed with the FERC to merge its assets and operations with the assets and operations of Carnegie Pipeline. The Company anticipates approval of the merger in 2003. In July 2001, Equitrans, L.P, filed an application with the FERC to transfer all of its natural gas pipeline gathering systems located in West Virginia and Pennsylvania to a subsidiary of the Company within the Equitable Supply segment. In February 2002, the FERC approved the application that resulted in the transfer of the gathering systems. The transfer was effective January 1, 2002 for segment reporting purposes. The systems transferred consist of approximately 1,200 miles of low pressure, small diameter pipeline and related facilities used to gather gas from wells in the region. Total system throughput is approximately 14 Bcf annually, generating annual revenues of approximately $4 million. The effect of this transfer is not material to the results of operations or financial position of Equitable Resources. Additionally, the effect of this transfer is not material to the results of operations or financial position of the Equitable Utilities or Equitable Supply segments. Therefore, segment results have not been restated for this transfer. Energy Marketing Equitable Utilities unregulated marketing entity provides commodity procurement and delivery, risk management and customer services to energy consumers including large industrial, utility, commercial and institutional end users. This divisions primary focus is to provide products and services in those areas where the Company has a strategic marketing advantage, usually due to geographic coverage and ownership of physical or contractual assets. The Company also engages in limited trading activity, with the objective of limiting exposure to shifts in market prices. Equitable Energy uses prudent asset management to optimize the Companys assets through trading activities. Historically, Equitable Utilities marketing affiliate purchased and resold a portion of Equitable Supplys production. Beginning January 1, 2003, these marketing activities will be recorded directly in Equitable Supply. The change will not have a significant impact on the Company as a whole; however, there will be a significant reduction in the marketing revenues and purchased natural gas costs for the unregulated marketing activities recorded in Equitable Utilities. 22 Capital Expenditures Equitable Utilities forecasts 2003 capital expenditures to be approximately $73 million, a 4% increase over capital expenditures of approximately $70 million for 2002. The 2003 capital expenditures are expected to include 2002 capital commitments totaling $11 million. The total 2003 expenditures include $56 million for Utilities infrastructure improvements, $12 million for technology enhancements and $5 million for new business development. The infrastructure improvements include improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines as well as storage enhancements. The technology expenditures are related to improved measurement, mobilization and automation initiatives and the continued implementation of a customer information and billing system for the distribution operations. The new business capital is planned for distribution extension projects. Results of Operations Equitable Utilities The Company classified all gains and losses associated with its energy trading activities to a net presentation for all periods presented in accordance with EITF No. 02 3. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 OPERATIONAL DATA Operating expenses/net revenues 56.33 % 65.77 % 60.85 % Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 70,188 $ 38,528 $ 28,436 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Utility revenues $ 343,847 $ 408,812 $ 377,700 Marketing revenues 410,426 440,246 393,867 Total operating revenues 754,273 849,058 771,567 Cost of sales (purchased natural gas cost) 520,866 618,316 534,088 Net operating revenues 233,407 230,742 237,479 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance (O&M) 50,335 56,013 59,072 Selling, general and administrative 54,249 69,344 57,244 Depreciation 26,894 26,404 28,185 Total operating expenses 131,478 151,761 144,501 Operating income 101,929 78,981 92,978 Other income (loss) EBIT $ 101,929 $ 78,981 $ 92,978 Equitable Utilities had operating income of $101.9 million for 2002, compared with $79.0 million for 2001. The improved results for 2002 are primarily due to higher revenues resulting from cooler weather in the fourth quarter 2002, non recurring 2001 charges related to pipeline operations workforce reductions and compressor station automation, and an incremental credit related reserve of $7.0 million. Operating income for Equitable Utilities decreased 15.1% from 2000 to 2001. The decrease in 2001 is primarily due to reduced revenues resulting from warmer weather, charges related to pipeline operations workforce reductions, and a charge related to a decision to add a $7.0 million incremental credit related reserve. 23 Capital expenditures increased $31.7 million to $70.2 million in 2002 from $38.5 million in 2001 due to increased infrastructure improvement and technological enhancement projects.

Each degree the average daily temperature falls below 65 degrees represents a heating degree day. (b)O&M is defined for this calculation as the sum of operation and maintenance and selling, general and administrative expenses ($76,139,000), excluding other taxes ($2,994,000). Therefore, O&M per customer in 2002 is computed as follows: $73,145,000 divided by 275,000 customers. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Residential net operating revenues $ 105,323 $ 103,141 $ 111,079 Commercial and industrial net operating revenues 46,846 44,399 44,403 Other net operating revenues 3,924 7,084 4,336 Total net operating revenues $ 156,093 $ 154,624 $ 159,818 Operating expenses (total operating expenses excluding depreciation) 76,139 84,276 78,454 Depreciation 19,933 18,175 17,411 Operating income $ 60,021 $ 52,173 $ 63,953 Net revenues for 2002 were $156.1 million compared to $154.6 million in 2001. Heating degree days were 5,258 for 2002, which is 4% cooler than the 5,059 degree days recorded in 2001 and 12% warmer than the 30 year normal of 5,968. The colder weather had a positive year over year impact on net revenues of approximately $2.2 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in late fee revenue due to improved accounts receivable collections. Commercial and industrial volumes increased 22% from prior year primarily due to the increased sales to steel industry customers. Despite the increase in commercial and industrial volumes, net operating revenues did not proportionately increase due to the relatively low margins on industrial customer volumes. Total operating expenses decreased $8.1 million, or 10% from $84.3 million in 2001. The decrease is attributable to the non recurring $7.0 million charge for incremental credit related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The operating expenses were also favorably impacted by reduced operations and maintenance expenses related to continued process improvement initiatives and reduced collection related costs. The reduced operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by increases in pension and post retirement benefit costs. 24 Net revenues for 2001 were $154.6 million compared to $159.8 million in 2000. Heating degree days were 5,059 for 2001, which is 10% warmer than the 5,596 degree days recorded in 2000 and 15% warmer than the 30 year average of 5,968. The warmer weather had a negative year over year impact on net revenues of approximately $7.8 million, which was partially offset by increased delivery margins. Commercial and industrial volumes declined 25% from prior year primarily due to the economic decline in the domestic steel industry. The negative net revenue impact from warmer weather was partially mitigated by an increase in industrial demand charge revenues from new customers and reduced gas costs for non regulated commercial and industrial customers, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2001. Total operating expenses increased $5.8 million, or 7% from $78.5 million in 2000. The increase is attributable to a $7.0 million charge for incremental credit related reserves in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increased operating expenses were partially offset by reduced operations and maintenance expenses related to continued process improvement initiatives. Pipeline Operations Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 OPERATIONAL DATA Transportation throughput (MMBtu) 70,197 70,693 81,692 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Net operating revenues $ 56,675 $ 62,079 $ 61,119 Operating expenses (Total operating expenses excluding depreciation) 24,744 33,249 29,040 Depreciation 6,553 7,872 10,577 Operating income $ 25,378 $ 20,958 $ 21,502 Net operating revenues from pipeline operations decreased to $56.7 million from $62.1 million in 2001. The decrease is related to the previously disclosed transfer of all of its natural gas pipeline gathering systems to the Equitable Supply segment. The transfer resulted in a reduction of $3.6 million in net revenues and $3.1 million in operating costs. Excluding the $3.6 million from the transfer and the first quarter 2001 one time gain on the sale of extraction facilities of $0.8 million, the net revenues decreased 2% or $1.0 million from the prior year. The decrease is due to reduced extraction revenues from the sale of the facilities and unfavorable transportation margins due to competition. Operating expenses decreased by $8.5 million from $33.2 million in 2001. The decreased operating expenses are primarily due to the June 2001 and September 2001 charges for workforce reductions and process improvements related to compressor automation totaling $6.0 million. The cost reductions from the prior year non recurring charges and continued process improvement initiatives favorably impacted the 2002 expenses. These cost savings were offset by the Companys decision to accelerate a pipeline maintenance program. Total operating expenses were also reduced by $3.1 million from the previously mentioned transfer of gathering systems. Net revenues from pipeline operations in 2001 increased to $62.1 million from $61.1 million in 2000. Pipeline revenues in 2000 include $3.8 million for the recovery of stranded costs in rates from the previously mentioned Equitrans rate case settlement. Excluding the $3.8 million from the settlement in 2000, the net revenues increased 8% from the prior year. This increase is largely associated with the storage related service revenues resulting from improved asset utilization. The transportation throughput decline of 13% from 2000 is primarily due to the reduced throughput resulting from warmer weather than prior year. 25  Operating expenses increased by $4.2 million in 2001 from $29.0 million in 2000. The increased operating expenses are due to the June 2001 and September 2001 charges for workforce reductions and process improvements related to compressor automation totaling $6.0 million. The one time charges were partially offset by reduced operations and maintenance costs associated with the current year workforce reductions and continued process improvement initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expenses for 2000 included $2.9 million of amortization expense related to the recovery of stranded costs in rates. Excluding the amortization expense from 2000, total depreciation and amortization expenses increased minimally due to the 2001 capital expenditure program. Energy Marketing Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 OPERATIONAL DATA Marketed gas sales (MMBtu) 169,942 215,541 240,922 Net marketed gas revenues/MMBtu $ 0.1128 $ 0.0603 $ 0.0676 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Net operating revenues $ 20,639 $ 14,039 $ 16,542 Operating expenses (Total operating expenses excluding depreciation) 3,701 7,832 8,822 Depreciation 408 357 197 Operating income $ 16,530 $ 5,850 $ 7,523 Net revenues for energy marketing operations increased $6.6 million, or 47% from $14.0 million in 2001. Excluding the prior year one time losses of $2.6 million on transactions marked to market, net revenues increased $4.0 million. This increase in net revenues and in unit marketing margins versus prior year is a result of the Companys decision to focus on storage and asset management activities and continued de emphasis on the low margin trading oriented activities. This decision resulted in the 21% reduction in marketed gas sales volumes in 2002. Operating expenses decreased 52.7% from 2001 to 2002. The decline in operating expenses is associated with a reduction in workforce due to reduced trading activities in 2002, decreased provisions for bad debts attributable to lower gas prices compared to prior year and reduced costs associated with retail marketing activities. Comparing 2001 to 2000, net revenues for energy marketing operations decreased $2.5 million, or 15% from $16.5 million in 2000. The decrease was due to lower per unit margins and an 11% reduction in volumes. The decline in volume is in line with the Companys strategic decision to reduce its trading activities that typically generate low margins and, as a result, are not a significant component of operating income. Operating expenses decreased 11% from 2000 to 2001. The decline in operating expenses is associated with a reduction in workforce due to the strategic decision to limit trading activities in 2001 and from increased investment costs in asset management and retail marketing activities. Equitable Supply Equitable Supply operates two lines of business production and gathering with operations in the Appalachian region of the United States. Equitable Production develops, produces and sells natural gas (and minor associated crude oil). Equitable Gathering engages in natural gas gathering and the 26 processing and sale of natural gas liquids. In April 2000, the Company merged its Equitable Production (Gulf) business with Westport Oil and Gas Company to form Westport Resources in which the Company retains an equity interest. The operations of Equitable Production (Gulf) through the date of the merger are presented after the operations of Equitable Production (Appalachian) and Equitable Gathering. Equitable Supply completed several transactions, which affect the comparability of the financial data between 2002, 2001 and 2000. Acquisitions In February 2000, Equitable Supply acquired the Appalachian production assets of Statoil for $630 million plus working capital adjustments for a total of $677 million. Statoils operations consisted of approximately 1,200 billion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves and 6,500 natural gas wells in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sale of Oil Properties In December of 2001, the Company sold its oil dominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities. The sale resulted in a decrease in 63 Bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately $60 million. The field produced approximately 4 Bcfe annually. Prepaid Natural Gas Sales During 2000, the Company utilized two prepaid natural gas sales transactions in order to limit its exposure to commodity volatility, to reduce counter party risk, and to raise capital. These contracts are based upon energy content or Btu. The Company converts these to their volumetric equivalents or Mcfe using a factor of 1.05 MMBtu per Mcfe. In December 2000, Equitable sold approximately 26.1 Bcf of future production for proceeds of $104 million. This natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability. Under the terms of this sales contract, the Company must deliver approximately 14,300 Mcf per day for five years starting January 1, 2001. The Company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered. In December 2000, Equitable sold approximately 26.6 Bcf of future production for proceeds of $105 million. This natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability. Under the terms of this sales contract, the Company must deliver approximately 24,300 Mcf per day for three years starting January 1, 2001. The Company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered. The following table details the specifics of the Companys various prepaid transactions as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, as the information is the same for all years. Total Contract Volume (Bcf) Contract Term Annual Volume (Bcf) Gathering Fee ($/Mcf) Wellhead Price ($/Mcf) Annual Revenue (Thousands) 26.1 5 years 5.2 $ 0.71 $ 3.28 $ 20,794 26.6 3 years 8.9 $ 0.71 $ 3.23 $ 34,922 Sales of Gas Properties Occasionally, the Company enters into a sale of gas properties in order to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility, to reduce counter party risk, eliminate production risk, and to raise capital, while 27 providing the Company market based fees associated with the gathering, marketing, and operation of these producing properties. In June 2000, Equitable sold properties with 66.0 Bcfe of reserves to a partnership, ESP, for proceeds of approximately $122.2 million and a retained interest in the partnership. This sale of gas properties reduces the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the partnership that is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the equity method of accounting. The transaction contains a provision, under certain circumstances, for the Companys equity interest to increase. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver their natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term. As the operator of the gas properties in the partnership, the Company may from time to time have receivables outstanding from ESP of up to $10 million. In December 2000, Equitable sold properties with 133.3 Bcfe of reserves to a trust, Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT), for proceeds of approximately $255.8 million and a retained interest in the trust. This sale of gas properties will reduce the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the trust, which is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the equity method of accounting. The transaction contains a provision, under certain circumstances, for the Companys equity interest to increase. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver their natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal. As the operator of the gas properties and as a result of a separate agreement, the Company receives a market based fee for providing a restricted line of credit to the trust that is limited by the fair market value of their remaining reserves. Below is a table that details the specifics of the Companys various sales of gas properties as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Volumes Produced (Bcfe) Revenue Recognized from Fees (Thousands) Sales of Gas Properties Reserves Sold (Bcfe) 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 ESP 66.0 9.6 10.3 6.6 $ 8,522 $ 8,876 $ 4,913 ANGT 133.3 14.2 15.4 $ 15,442 $ 16,130 $ In November 1995, the Company monetized Appalachian gas properties qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP). The Company recorded the proceeds as deferred revenue, which was recognized as production occurred. The Company retained a partnership interest in the properties that increased substantially based on the attainment of a performance target. The performance target was met at the end of 2001. Beginning in 2002, the Company no longer includes ABP volumes as monetized sales, but instead as equity production sales. As a result, monetized volumes sold decreased by approximately 8.9 Bcf while equity production increased by the same amount. The Company has consolidated the partnership starting in 2002, and the remaining portion not owned by the Company results in a minority interest. The minority interest recognized for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $7.1 million. As a result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP in 2002, the Company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to ABP. This resulted in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate during 2002. The nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002 and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future. 28 In February 2003, the Company purchased the remaining 31% limited partner interest in Appalachian Basin Partners, LP from the minority interest holders for $44.2 million. The limited partner interest represents approximately 60.2 Bcf of reserves. In addition, all open disputes with the minority interest holders were resolved. Capital Expenditures Equitable Supply forecasts its 2003 capital budget to be approximately $149 million. This includes $113 million for development of Appalachian holdings by Equitable Production and $36 million for improvements and extensions by Equitable Gathering to gathering system pipelines. The amount related to the ABP transaction was approved separately and in addition to the amounts for the capital budget of approximately $149 million. The forecasted level of development drilling is designed to allow for supply volumes to increase somewhat over 2002 levels. The evaluation of new development locations, market forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering system investments. Capital expenditures increased from $93.9 million in 2001 to $147.5 million in 2002 and were mainly attributable to an increased level of development drillings in the Appalachian holdings and gathering system enhancements. The capital expenditures in 2001 and 2002 included $81.0 million and $114.4 million, respectively, for development of Appalachian holdings and $12.9 million and $33.1 million, respectively, for gathering system improvements and extensions.

(b)Includes operated volumes plus volumes gathered for third parties. 29 Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Revenue from production $ 214,225 $ 229,344 $ 225,774 Revenues from services: Revenue from gathering fees 63,028 61,475 53,268 Other revenues 11,739 11,459 10,120 Net operating revenues 288,992 302,278 289,162 Operating expenses: Gathering and compression (operation and maintenance) 23,095 24,594 25,237 Production and leasehold 27,111 34,500 43,892 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 26,873 24,556 23,470 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 40,711 40,624 57,175 Strike related 18,694 Total operating expenses 117,790 124,274 168,468 Operating income 171,202 178,004 120,694 Equity from nonconsolidated investments 282 726 167 Minority interest (7,103 ) Other loss (6,951 ) EBIT $ 164,381 $ 178,730 $ 113,910 Equitable Supply had earnings before interest and taxes of $164.4 million for 2002, compared with $178.7 million in 2001. The lower results for 2002 are primarily due to a $0.25 reduction in average natural gas prices ($12.5 million) and the minority interest ownership in 2002 of the Appalachian Basin Partnership wells described above ($7.1 million), partially offset by reductions in operating expenses ($6.5 million). Earnings before interest and taxes increased to $178.7 million in 2001 compared to $113.9 million in 2000. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to higher average effective sales price of $3.72 in 2001, compared to $2.91 in 2000, increased sales volumes due to a full year ownership of the Statoil properties increased gathering fees, and lower operating expenses. These improvements were partially offset by the June and December 2000 sale of gas properties in the monetization transactions described above. On June 30, 2000, Equitable Supply sold a substantial portion of gas properties, which qualified for nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, ESP, which netted $122.2 million in cash and retained a minority interest in the partnership. In anticipation of this transaction, the Company had previously entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production. Removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a $7.0 million pretax charge recorded as other loss. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the period ended December 31, 2002 increased from the same period in 2001 due to costs associated with legal claims and reserves ($3.5 million). Excluding these charges, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased in total and per unit due to productivity improvements and a 13.0% increase in handled volumes. From 2000 to 2001 selling, general, and administrative expenses per Mcfe declined 13.0% due to on going synergies from the Statoil acquisition and an increase in handled volumes. 30 Equitable Production (Appalachian) Operational and Financial Data Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 OPERATIONAL DATA Net equity sales, natural gas and equivalents (MMcfe) 47,640 38,825 66,356 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.53 $ 3.67 $ 3.06 Monetized sales (MMcfe)(a) 14,079 22,845 11,105 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.27 $ 3.81 $ 2.04 Weighted average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.47 $ 3.72 $ 2.91 Company usage, line loss (MMcfe) 6,216 5,742 6,568 Lease operating expense (LOE), excluding severance tax ($/Mcfe) $ 0.27 $ 0.32 $ 0.33 Severance tax ($/Mcfe) $ 0.12 $ 0.16 $ 0.16 Depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 0.40 $ 0.38 $ 0.49 Total operated volumes (MMcfe)(b) 91,793 93,167 89,932 (a)Volumes sold associated with the Companys two prepaid natural gas sales contracts and the ABP partnership discussed above.

Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Produced natural gas sales $ 214,225 $ 229,344 $ 225,774 Other revenues 11,488 11,336 10,108 Total operating revenues 225,713 240,680 235,882 Operating expenses: Lease operating 18,141 21,855 27,893 Severance tax 8,123 10,640 13,103 Land and leasehold maintenance 847 2,005 2,896 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 18,926 16,207 15,490 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 28,387 28,465 45,186 Total operating expenses 74,424 79,172 104,568 Operating income $ 151,289 $ 161,508 $ 131,314 Equity from nonconsolidated investments 282 726 167 Minority interest/ other (7,103 ) (6,951 ) EBIT $ 144,468 $ 162,234 $ 124,530 Revenues from production, which are derived primarily from the sale of produced natural gas, decreased $15.0 million from 2001 to 2002. The decrease in revenues from production is due primarily to lower effective commodity prices ($15.3 million) and sales of oil properties ($17.0 million), partially offset by increased production from new drilling ($15.5 million) and production enhancements ($1.4 million). 31 Operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2002 decreased 6.0% from the same period in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a 17.0% decrease in lease operating expense resulting from reduced well tending expenses and productivity improvements and a 23.7% decrease in severance taxes, which is primarily due to declines in the market commodity sales price. Leasehold costs were also lower, as a result of lower delay rental costs due to improved acreage management. Revenues from production increased slightly from 2000 to 2001. The increase in revenues from production of $3.6 million from 2000 to 2001 was due primarily to the June and December 2000 sale of gas properties ($58.2 million), offset largely due to higher effective commodity prices ($49.6 million) in 2001 versus 2000, and increases in the sales volumes due to a full year ownership of the Statoil assets during 2001 ($13.1 million). Equitable Productions average selling prices for natural gas increased 27.8% over the same period. Other revenues increased by 12.1% due to increased service fees from the 2000 sales of gas properties. Operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2001 decreased 24.2% from the same period in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in operating costs related to the sale of gas properties to a partnership and a trust discussed above. Depletion expense was reduced both in total and on a per unit basis as a result of the production asset sales in calendar 2000. Equitable Gathering Operational and Financial Data Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 OPERATIONAL DATA Gathered volumes (MMcfe) 123,581 106,832 92,440 Average gathering fee ($/Mcfe)(a) $ 0.51 $ 0.58 $ 0.58 Gathering and compression expense ($/Mcfe) $ 0.19 $ 0.23 $ 0.27 Gathering and compression depreciation ($/Mcfe) $ 0.09 $ 0.10 $ 0.11 (a)Revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect, process and deliver natural gas from the field where it is produced, to the trunk or main transmission line. Many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price. In this case the Company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Gathering revenues $ 63,028 $ 61,475 $ 53,268 Other revenues 251 123 12 Total operating revenues 63,279 61,598 53,280 Operating expenses: Gathering and compression 23,095 24,594 25,237 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 7,947 8,349 7,980 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 12,324 12,159 11,989 Strike related expenses 18,694 Total operating expenses 43,366 45,102 63,900 EBIT $ 19,913 $ 16,496 $ (10,620 ) 32 The total operating revenue from gathering fees increased 2.7% from 2001 to 2002, primarily due to a 15.7% increase in gathered volumes offset by a 12% decrease in the average gathering fee per Mcfe. The increase in gathered volumes is primarily due to the transfer of the Equitrans gathering pipeline system from the Equitable Utilities segment. The decrease in average gathering fees per Mcfe is a result of the $0.25/Dth default rate on the Equitrans gathering pipeline system resulting from the FERC approved spin down. This rate remains in effect until March 2004. Operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2002 decreased 3.9% from the same period in 2001 despite a 15.7% increase in gathered volumes. This decrease was primarily due to a 6.1% decrease in gathering and compression costs primarily due to a reduction in third party gathering costs. Additional positive items include decreased general and administrative expenses, both in total and on a per unit basis. Revenues from gathering increased 15.6% from 2000 to 2001, primarily due to the increase in gathered volumes, consistent with the increase in sales volumes noted above from the Statoil assets and absence of a work stoppage in 2001. The gathering revenue increases were not offset by the June and December 2000 asset sales, as the production from these wells is still gathered and compressed by the Company. Operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2001 decreased 29.4% from the same period in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the absence of strike related expenses incurred in 2000 and operating improvements in the Kentucky West pipeline unit offset by increased operating expenses due to full year ownership of Statoil assets. Gathering and compression expenses per Mcfe decreased 14.8% due to operating improvements in the Kentucky West pipeline unit and lower cost gathering on the acquired assets. Equitable Production (Gulf) As described above, the Equitable Production Gulf Operations were merged into Westport effective April 1, 2000. As such, there is no activity for the Production Gulf Operations in 2002 and 2001. The following description includes results prior to the merger. During 2000, seven gross wells were drilled at a success rate of 86%. 33 Production (Gulf Operations) 2000 OPERATIONAL DATA Production: Net sales, natural gas and equivalents (MMcfe) 6,087 Average sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 2.77 LOE ($/Mcfe) $ 0.24 SG&A ($/Mcfe) $ 0.27 Depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 1.11 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 9,034 2000 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Revenue from Production $ 16,885 Other revenues 70 Total revenues 16,955 Gathering and compression expense 17 Lease operating expense 1,454 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 6,891 Selling, general and administrative expense 1,643 Exploration and dry hole expense 524 Total operating expenses $ 10,529 Operating income $ 6,426 Results of operations for the Gulf Operations in 2000 include only the first quarter.

The Company has not made any international investments since April 2001. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 OPERATIONAL DATA Revenue backlog at December 31 (Thousands) $ 118,224 $ 128,264 $ 90,978 Gross profit margin 21.2 % 22.0 % 24.8 % SG&A as a % of revenue 12.4 % 14.7 % 17.0 % Development expense as a % of revenue 2.2 % 2.6 % 3.3 % Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 698 $ 289 $ 1,596 34 Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Energy service contracting revenues $ 190,107 $ 157,379 $ 134,620 Energy service contract cost 149,801 122,790 101,266 Net operating revenue (gross margin) 40,306 34,589 33,354 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 23,521 23,112 22,873 Impairment of long lived assets 5,320 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,618 5,952 5,304 Total operating expenses 30,459 29,064 28,177 Operating income 9,847 5,525 5,177 Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments 4,699 7,555 5,109 EBIT $ 14,546 $ 13,080 $ 10,286 Revenues increased to $190.1 million in 2002 from $157.4 million in 2001, an increase of $32.7 million, or 20.8%. This increase was due primarily to increased construction activity versus the prior year. Gross margins decreased to 21.2% in 2002 from 22.0% in 2001, reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year. Gross margins have trended downwards over the past three years due to competitive pressures and focus on larger projects with lower gross margins. Gross margin in 2002 included a demand side management program termination of $2.4 million. Total construction completed during 2002 was $126.9 million versus $103.0 million in 2001, an increase of $23.9 million over 2001. This increase was primarily due to construction activity for a new power plant in California and increased backlog at the beginning of the year, which was subsequently constructed in 2002. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $4.7 million in 2002 and $7.6 million in 2001 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to decreased earnings in a power plant in Panama and another one in Rhode Island. SG&A expenses increased slightly to $23.5 million in 2002 from $23.1 million in 2002. Included in SG&A expenses in both 2002 and 2001 were $1.0 million related to office consolidations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased from 2001 to 2002 by $4.3 million, primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization of $3.7 million. Revenue backlog decreased to $118.2 million at year end 2002 from $128.3 million at year end 2001. The decrease in backlog is primarily attributable to delays in the awarding of government contracts. Substantially all of the backlog is expected to be completed within the next 12 months. During the second quarter 2002, the Company reviewed the Jamaica power plant project related to the Noresco operating segment for impairment as the project had not been operating to expected levels and repeated remediation efforts were unsuccessful. The Company owns 91.2% of the equity in the project and therefore consolidates the project in its financial statements. As a result of the Companys review, an impairment loss of $5.3 million was recorded to adjust the project assets to their fair value. Actual results of the Jamaican power plant project have supported the impairment analysis as performance continues to decline, causing on going operations to be in doubt. Notwithstanding the write down of the investment to zero, because the Jamaican power plant is part of the Companys consolidated financial statements, it will continue to record any losses from operations despite the nonrecourse nature of the related debt. 35  Revenues increased from 2000 to 2001 by $22.8 million, or 16.9%, due primarily to the increase in construction backlog at the beginning of 2001 versus the beginning of 2000. Gross margins decreased to 22.0% in 2001 from 24.8% in 2000, reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year. Total construction completed during 2001 was $103.0 million versus $85.1 million in 2000, an increase of $17.9 million over 2000. This increase was primarily due to the increased construction backlog at the beginning of 2001 versus the beginning of 2000. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $7.6 million in 2001 and $5.1 million in 2000 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets. The increase in earnings was primarily due to improved earnings in two power plants in Panama. SG&A expenses were flat from 2000 to 2001. Included in SG&A expenses in 2001 were $1.4 million related to office consolidations in the third quarter. Included in SG&A expenses in 2000 were $1.0 million related to the decision to discontinue developing international energy infrastructure projects and $0.4 million of additional costs related to the closing of three unprofitable energy services contracting offices. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased from 2000 to 2001 by $0.6 million, or 12.2%. This increase is primarily due to increased DD&A for power plant projects. Other Income Statement Items Other Income Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands) Other income (loss): Equity in (loss) earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ (3,463 ) $ 26,101 $ 25,161 Minority interest (7,103 ) Gain on sale of Westport stock 6,561 Other loss (6,951 ) Total other income (loss) $ (10,566 ) $ 26,101 $ 24,771 Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments decreased in 2002 primarily due to reduced earnings from the Companys ownership interest in Westport and the NORESCO segments investments in independent power plant projects in Panama and Rhode Island. Beginning in 2002, the Company consolidated ABP, with the portion not owned by the Company being recorded as minority interest. The minority interest recognized for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $7.1 million. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments in 2000 included a gain on sale of Westport stock. In October 2000, Westport completed an IPO of its shares. Equitable sold 1.325 million shares in this IPO for an after tax gain of $4.3 million. On June 30, 2000, Equitable sold a substantial portion of gas properties, which qualified for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, ESP, which netted $122.2 million in cash and retained a minority interest in the partnership. In anticipation of this transaction, the Company had previously entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production. Removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a $7.0 million pretax charge recorded as other loss. 36 Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands) Interest expense $ 38,787 $ 41,098 $ 75,661 In 2002, interest expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in interest rates on short term debt. This decrease was partially offset by the higher interest expense associated with the new long term notes issued in November 2002. Interest expense decreased in 2001 as a result of a $472 million decrease in average short term debt outstanding, due to the reduction in short term debt originally extended to finance the Statoil acquisition in February of 2000, and subsequently extinguished with the proceeds from the two prepaid natural gas sales and the sale of natural gas properties discussed above. Average annual interest rates on short term debt were 1.8%, 4.1%, and 6.4% for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Other Items Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change In accordance with the requirements of Statement No. 142, the Company tested its goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2002. The Companys goodwill balance as of January 1, 2002 totaled $57.3 million and is entirely related to the NORESCO segment. The fair value of the Companys goodwill was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information. As a result of the impairment test, the Company recognized an impairment of $5.5 million, net of tax, to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value as the level of future cash flows from the NORESCO segment are expected to be less than originally anticipated. In accordance with Statement No. 142, this impairment adjustment has been reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the Companys Statements of Consolidated Income retroactive to the first quarter 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required. Income from Discontinued Operations In April 1998, management adopted a formal plan to sell the Companys natural gas midstream operations. A capital loss was treated as a nondeductible item for tax reporting purposes under the then current Treasury regulations embodying the "loss disallowance rule," resulting in additional tax recorded on this sale as a reduction to net income from discontinued operations. In May 2002, the IRS issued new Treasury regulations interpreting the "loss disallowance rule" that now permit this capital loss to be treated as deductible. During June 2002, the Company filed amended tax return filings. Consequently, in the second quarter 2002, the Company recorded a $9.0 million increase in net income from discontinued operations related to this unexpected tax benefit. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $213.0 million in 2002 as compared to $129.9 million in 2001. The $83.1 million increase in operating cash flows from 2002 to 2001 is primarily the result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP in 2002, in addition to a $36.9 million increase in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change excluding undistributed earnings from nonconsolidated investments, minority interest, and an 37 impairment of long lived assets. The combined change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues, inventory, and accounts payable did not significantly impact the net amount of cash provided by operating activities. At the end of 2001, the Companys ownership interest in ABP substantially increased to 69% as a result of existing contractual arrangements. Consequently, beginning in 2002, the Company no longer includes ABP production volumes as monetized sales, but instead as equity production sales. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2002, the Company consolidated the partnership with the portion not owned by the Company recorded as a minority interest. The minority interest recognized by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $7.1 million. During 2002, the Company paid approximately $0.4 million to the minority interest owners of ABP. During 2001 the Company paid approximately $40.9 million to the other owners of ABP. The Companys income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change totaled $150.6 million in 2002 as compared to $151.8 million in 2001. Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2002 included undistributed losses from nonconsolidated investments of $3.5 million while income from continuing operations in 2001 included undistributed earnings from nonconsolidated investments of $22.2 million. The $25.7 million decrease in undistributed earnings from nonconsolidated investments from 2002 to 2001 primarily relates to the Companys equity ownership interest in Westport. Also included in the $150.6 million of income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2002 is minority interest expense associated with ABP totaling $7.1 million in addition to a $5.3 million impairment associated with a Jamaican energy infrastructure project that is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change excluding undistributed earnings from nonconsolidated investments, minority interest expense, and an impairment of long lived assets totaled $166.5 million and $129.6 million during 2002 and 2001, respectively. The $37.0 million increase is primarily attributable to the overall performance of the Companys operating segments as previously described in addition to an $8.4 million increase in the amount of nonconventional fuels tax credit received by the Company as a result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP during 2002. Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $167.7 million in 2002 as compared to $125.8 million in 2001 and $363.0 million in 2000. The Company expended approximately $218.5 million in 2002 for capital expenditures as compared to $132.7 million in 2001 and $123.7 million in 2000. Equitable Supply spent $147.5 million of which $114.4 million was spent on developmental drilling and $33.1 million was spent on infrastructure projects. Equitable Utilities spent $70.2 million, of which $58.3 million was spent on infrastructure projects and $11.9 million was spent on business development. Cash used in 2002 investing activities included $17.6 million invested in available for sale securities intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the Company self insures. These securities had net unrealized losses of $1.5 million. Cash provided by investing activities in 2001 included $63.0 million of proceeds from the oil dominated field sale within Equitable Supply. These proceeds were held in a restricted cash account at December 31, 2001 for use in a potential like kind exchange for certain identified assets. During 2002, the restrictions lapsed and the cash was made available for operations. 38 Cash used in investing activities in 2000 also included the acquisition of Statoil properties for $677.2 million and an increase in equity in nonconsolidated investments due to the Westport merger, the combination of which were partially offset by the net proceeds received from the sales of producing properties and from the Gulf asset merger with Westport. A total of $228 million was authorized for the 2003 capital budget program, as previously described in the business segment results. The Company expects to finance this program with cash generated from operations and with short term debt. Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $57.2 million in 2002 as compared to $26.5 million of cash flows used in financing activities in 2001 and $35.8 million of cash flows provided by financing activities in 2000. The increase in cash used in financing activities from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of an $82.2 million reduction of proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the sale of contract receivables during 2002 offset by the net of the proceeds from issuance of $200 million of long term debt in the fourth quarter of 2002 to pay down commercial paper and $142.6 million reduction in short term loans. The additional payments on the proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the transfer of contract receivables is primarily the result of the significant amount of transfers done in 2001 and the fact that certain of the Companys debt covenants limit the amount of contract receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time. The $200 million of long term debt issued in 2002 has a stated interest rate of 5.15% and is due in 2012. Net cash used in financing activities during 2002 and 2001 also includes the Companys purchase of shares of its outstanding stock and the payment of dividends through the use of cash provided by operating activities. During 2002 and 2001, the Company repurchased 2.9 million and 1.8 million shares of its outstanding common stock for $97.0 million and $61.2 million, respectively. Of the 18.8 million total shares authorized for repurchase, the Company has repurchased approximately 15.2 million shares through December 31, 2002. Additionally, during 2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company paid dividends on its common shares totaling $41.8 million, $40.4 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. Short term loans are used to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season. The Company has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing requirements. Bank loans and commercial paper, supported by available credit, are used to meet short term financing requirements. Interest rates on these short term loans averaged 1.8% during 2002. The Company maintains a three year revolving credit agreement and a 364 day credit agreement with a group of banks providing a total of $500 million of available credit, which expire in 2003 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had the authority to support a $650 million commercial paper program. The Companys credit ratings, as determined by either Standards & Poors or Moodys on its non credit enhanced, senior unsecured long term debt, determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit; the lower the Companys credit rating, the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had not borrowed any amounts against these lines of credit. Facility fees, averaging one eleventh of one percent in 2002 and one twelfth of one percent in 2001, were paid to maintain credit availability. 39 Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of falling commodity prices. Since it is primarily a natural gas company, this leads to different approaches to hedging natural gas than for crude oil and natural gas liquids. Equitable has taken advantage of favorable gas prices to significantly hedge production. The approximate volumes and prices of Equitables hedges and fixed price contracts for 2003 2005 are: 2003 2004 2005 Volume (Bcf) 45 37 34 Average Price (NYMEX)* $ 4.20 $ 4.41 $ 4.53 *The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMbtu/Mcf With respect to hedging as of December 31, 2002, the Companys exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices under current market conditions is $0.05 per diluted share per $0.10 change in the average NYMEX natural gas price for 2003, $0.025 to $0.03 per diluted share for 2004 and 2005, and less than $0.05 per diluted share through 2008. In addition to monetizations, the Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure. The Company has relied almost exclusively on fixed price swaps to accomplish the remainder of this objective during 2001 and 2002 due to the increased market volatility. Investment Securities Investments classified by the Company as available for sale consist of debt and equity securities. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," (Statement No. 115) available for sale securities are required to be carried at fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within a separate equity component, accumulated other comprehensive income. The Statement also requires the Company to perform an impairment analysis to assess whether a decline in fair market value below the amortized cost is other than temporary. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the securities must be written down to fair value, as the new cost basis, and the amount of the impairment must be included in earnings. At December 31, 2002, the Companys gross unrealized losses relating to these securities were approximately $2.1 million, or 13% of its fair value. The Company performed an impairment analysis in accordance with Statement No. 115 and concluded that the decline below cost is not other than temporary. Factors and considerations the Company used to support this conclusion were as follows: (a)The debt and equity securities are broad based index funds providing reasonable opportunity for recovery. (b)The Company has held these securities for less than one year, which is not a sufficient time period to appropriately assess whether the decline is other than temporary. (c)The securities were purchased to partially fund future natural gas well plugging and abandonment costs that will be incurred over an extended period of time, significant portions of which are not projected to occur for over 40 years. (d)There are no plans to sell the securities in the near term. 40 Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments In April 2000, the Company merged its Gulf of Mexico operations with Westport Oil and Gas Company for $50 million in cash and approximately 49% interest in the combined company, named Westport Resources Corporation. In October 2000, Westport completed an IPO of its shares. Equitable sold 1.3 million shares in this IPO for an after tax gain of $4.3 million, leaving Equitable with a total of 13.9 million shares, or approximately 36% interest in Westport. On August 21, 2001, Westport completed a merger with Belco Oil & Gas. On November 19, 2002, Westport completed a private offering of 3.1 million shares of Westport common stock and on December 16, 2002, Westport closed a public offering of 11.5 million shares. Equitable continues to own 13.9 million shares, which now represent 20.8% of Westports total shares outstanding at December 31, 2002. The fair market value of Equitables investment in Westport was $289.3 million as of December 31, 2002. The tax basis of the investment was $73.9 million as of December 31, 2002. The Companys intention is to continue to reduce its percentage ownership, whether by dilution as Westport grows, sales of stock, or other means. If the Companys ownership interest in Westport decreases to below 20%, the Company believes its influence will not be significant enough to warrant equity accounting. During 2000, as more fully explained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Equitable Supply sold an interest in oil and gas properties to a partnership, ESP. The Company retained a 1% interest and negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver its natural gas to the market. The Company treats oil and gas partnership interests as equity in nonconsolidated investments. Also in 2000, as more fully explained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Equitable Supply sold an interest in oil and gas properties to a trust, ANGT. The Company retained a 1% interest and has separately negotiated arms length, market based rates with ANGT for gathering, marketing and operating fees to deliver their natural gas to the market. Additionally, the Company has contracted for a market based fee, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, a liquidity reserve guarantee secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by ANGT for a market based fee. The Company treats its interest in ANGT as equity in nonconsolidated investments. NORESCO has equity ownership interests in independent power plant (IPP) projects located domestically and in selected international locations. Long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) are signed with the customer whereby they agree to purchase the energy generated by the plant. The length of these contracts ranges from 1 to 30 years. The Company has not made an investment since April 2001 and has a total cumulative investment of $43.8 million. The Companys share of the earnings for 2002 and 2001 related to the total investment was $4.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively. These projects generally are financed on a project basis with nonrecourse financings established at the project level. In 2001, one of the Companys domestic power plant projects, in which the Company owns a 50% interest, Capital Center Energy in Rhode Island, began experiencing billing disputes. The project has reserved for the amounts in dispute pending resolution of the issues. These disputes adversely affect the cash flows and the financial stability of the project and could trigger project loan covenant violations, particularly if resolution of the disputes is further delayed. In September 2002, the Company filed a complaint against an energy customer, in Providence Superior Court. The complaint requests the court to enter a judgment against the energy customer for the $2.3 million owed for energy services rendered through July 2002. In December, a significant energy customer filed a third party complaint against the site owner, for the alleged breach of its lease with the owner. In December, the Company issued a notice to the energy customer threatening to shut off services unless its account was brought current through July 2002, and a settlement, featuring a current lump sum payment from the customer and reduced payments for energy supplied going forward (pending final settlement) was entered into on December 31, 2002. The Company also provided the site owner a final settlement offer, which, if 41 accepted, would result in resolution of all outstanding payment issues. The settlement would also address the future billing structure for energy services, with a goal of minimizing future collection issues. NORESCOs equity interest in this non recourse financed project is $4.4 million as of December 31, 2002. The Company performed an impairment analysis, in accordance with Statement No. 144, of its equity interest in this project as of December 31, 2002. No impairment was required. One of the Companys two Panamanian projects, in which the Company owns a 45% interest, Petroelectrica de Panama, is a party to a five year PPA, which expires in February 2003. The project debt was fully satisfied in December 2002. In November 2002, the project won a bid in which the majority of the projects available capacity is under contract with a local distribution company for the twelve months beginning February 1, 2003. The Company owns a 50% interest in a second Panamanian electric generation project, IGC/ERI Pan Am Thermal. The project had previously agreed to retrofit the plant to conform to environmental noise standards by a target date of August 31, 2001. Unforeseen events delayed the final completion date of the required retrofits. The project has obtained an extension from the Panamanian government while it evaluates a land acquisition/rezoning proposal, which, if accepted and executed, would obviate the need for a retrofit requirement. The creditor sponsor continues to evaluate the land acquisition/rezoning proposal while concurrently exploring the feasibility of a final technical resolution to the noise issues. The Company is coordinating with the creditor sponsor to obtain any additional regulatory extensions, which may be required. In September and October, the Panamanian government adopted two resolutions which affect the plants compliance requirements by suspending the noise mitigation deadline while the Company achieves the objectives of the land acquisition and rezoning proposal, and by modifying the noise standards applicable to the plant (by making them less stringent). The expected additional cost to the Company of achieving resolution of this issue, whether by a retrofit or implementation of the land acquisition/rezoning proposal, is not expected to exceed $1.5 million. Additionally, this project experienced poor financial performance during 2002 due to adverse weather (abnormally high rainfall), other adverse market related conditions, and reduced plant availability related to planned and unplanned outages during the first quarter. These factors depressed revenues, causing a drop below the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant of the non recourse loan document. The Company has been actively coordinating with the creditor sponsor on this matter and during the second half of 2002 experienced improvement in operational and financial performance. Despite the debt service coverage ratio issues, cash flows and payment of debt service are expected to be adequate through 2003. The Company performed an impairment analysis, in accordance with Statement No. 144, of its equity interest in this project as of December 31, 2002. No impairment was required. Stock Split On April 19, 2001, the Board of Directors of Equitable Resources declared a two for one stock split payable on June 11, 2001 to shareholders of record on May 11, 2001. Acquisitions and Dispositions In December 2001, the Company sold its oil dominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities. The sale resulted in a decrease in 63 Bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately $60 million. The field produced approximately 4 Bcfe annually. The proceeds are shown in the December 31, 2001 Consolidated Balance Sheet as restricted cash. The restriction lapsed and the cash became unrestricted in the second quarter of 2002. See Note 8 for additional information related to the restricted cash. In December 2000, the Company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales contracts for 52.7 MMcf of reserves. The Company is required to sell and deliver certain quantities of natural gas during 42 the term of the contracts. The first contract is for five years with net proceeds of $104.0 million. The second contract is for three years with net proceeds of $104.8 million and will be completed at the end of 2003. These contracts were recorded as prepaid gas forward sales and are being recognized in income as deliveries occur. In December 2000, Equitable sold properties, previously acquired from Statoil, with approximately 133.3 Bcfe of reserves to a trust, ANGT, for proceeds of $255.8 million and a retained minority interest in the trust. In anticipation of this transaction, the Company had previously entered into financial hedges. Removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a $57.7 million charge that was offset against the gain recognized on the sale of these properties. The proceeds received were used to pay down short term debt associated with the Statoil acquisition. Equitable accounts for its $36.1 million investment under the equity method of accounting. Equitable estimates that it will receive $15.0 million in fees for operating the wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the trust in 2003 based on expected production volumes. In June 2000, Equitable sold properties, which contained approximately 66.0 Bcfe of reserves that qualified for nonconventional fuels tax credits to a partnership, ESP, which netted $122.2 million in cash and a retained minority interest in this partnership. The proceeds received were used to pay down short term debt associated with the Statoil acquisition. Prior to the transaction, the Company entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production. Removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a $7.0 million pretax charge recorded as other loss. Equitable accounts for its remaining $26.1 million investment under the equity method of accounting. Equitable estimates that it will receive $8.1 million in fees for operating the wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the purchaser in 2003 based on expected production volumes. In April 2000, the Company merged Equitable Production (Gulf) with Westport Oil and Gas Company based in Denver, Colorado, in exchange for $50.0 million and a 49% ownership interest in the combined entity, Westport Resources Corporation. In February 2000, the Company acquired the Appalachian production assets of Statoil for $630 million plus working capital adjustments for a total of $677 million. The Company initially funded this acquisition through commercial paper, which was replaced by a combination of financings and cash from asset sales. Newly Issued Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This Statement supercedes or amends existing accounting literature related to the impairment and disposal of long lived assets. In accordance with Statement No. 144, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company reviews its long lived assets for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the assets undiscounted cash flows, the Company estimates an impairment loss by taking the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the assets. During the second quarter 2002, the Company reviewed the Jamaica power plant project related to the NORESCO operating segment for impairment as the project had not been operating to expected levels and remediation efforts were unsuccessful. The Company owns 91.2% of the equity in the project and therefore consolidates the project in its financial statements. As a result of the Companys review, an impairment loss of $5.3 million was recorded to adjust the project assets to their fair value. Fair value was based on the expected future cash flows to be generated by the Jamaican power plant, 43 discounted at the risk free rate of interest. Notwithstanding the write down of the Companys investment to zero, because the Jamaican power plant is part of the Companys consolidated financial statements, it will continue to record any losses from operations despite the nonrecourse nature of the related debt. In June 2002, the FASBs EITF issued EITF No. 02 3, "Recognition and Reporting of Gains and Losses on Energy Trading Contracts under EITF Issues No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," and No. 00 17, "Measuring the Fair Value of Energy Related Contracts in Applying Issue No. 98 10." EITF No. 02 3 was initially effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after July 15, 2002 and required that gains and losses on energy trading contracts be recorded net (i.e., within operating revenues) on a companys income statement. Prior to this guidance, the Company reported the gains and losses on its energy trading contracts gross (i.e., included the revenues and costs comprising the gains and losses on energy trading derivative contracts within operating revenues and cost of sales, respectively) on its Statements of Consolidated Income in accordance with the guidance contained in EITF No. 98 10. As a result of the guidance contained in EITF No. 02 3, in the third quarter 2002, the Company classified all gains and losses on its energy trading contracts net on its Statements of Consolidated Income for all periods presented. In the fourth quarter 2002, the FASB revised its consensus contained in EITF No. 02 3. EITF No. 02 3, as revised, rescinds the guidance contained in EITF No. 98 10 and requires that only energy trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative in Statement No. 133 be carried at fair value. Energy trading contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative must be accounted for as an executory contract (i.e., on an accrual basis). Additionally, EITF No. 02 3, as revised, states that it will no longer be an acceptable industry practice to account for energy inventory held for trading purposes at fair value when fair value exceeds cost, unless explicitly provided by other authoritative literature. The EITFs revised consensus is effective for all new energy trading contracts entered into and energy inventory held for trading purposes purchased after October 25, 2002. For any energy trading contracts entered into or energy inventory held for trading purposes as of October 25, 2002, companies are required to recognize a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle beginning the first day of the first fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2002. The implementation of the above provisions of EITF No. 02 3 effective for the year ended December 31, 2002 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Additionally, management does not expect the implementation of the above provisions of EITF No. 02 3 that are effective in 2003 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. EITF No. 02 3, as revised, also requires that all gains and losses on derivative instruments held for trading purposes be presented on a net basis in the income statement for all periods presented, whether or not settled physically. For gains and losses on energy trading activities that are not derivatives pursuant to Statement No. 133, the presentation is determined based upon the guidance contained in EITF No. 99 19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent." This guidance is effective for all periods presented in financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002 (earlier adoption is permitted). Prior to the implementation of this guidance, companies are able to present these gains or losses on either a gross or a net basis in accordance with the provisions contained in EITF No. 98 10. In response to the revised guidance on the presentation of gains and losses on energy trading contracts contained in EITF No. 02 3, the Company reevaluated the gross to net reclassifications it had made in its third quarter 2002 statements and has adjusted those reclassifications to be in accordance with EITF No. 02 3, as revised. The reduction from a gross to a net classification has resulted in a reduction in both operating revenues and cost of sales for the Equitable Utilities segment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, of $169.4 million, $592.0 million, and $615.7 million, respectively. 44  In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," (Statement No. 143) which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Statement No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized by the Company at the time the obligation is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company must also capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its future value through charges to operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount, the Company will recognize a gain or loss upon settlement. The Company has not fully completed its analysis, but expects the adoption of Statement No. 143 to result in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $30.0 million to $40.0 million and a cumulative effect of adoption loss of $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition, the Company anticipates recording accretion and depletion expense of $1.5 million to $4.0 million in 2003. In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," (Statement No. 146) which supercedes EITF No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employment Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity." Statement No. 146 requires companies to record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized only when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal activity. Adoption of this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, amending FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" (Statement No. 148). This statement amends Statement No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Finally, Statement No. 148 amends APB Opinion No. 28 "Interim Financial Reporting" to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. The Company will adopt the disclosure provisions and the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 clarifies and expands on existing disclosure requirements for guarantees, including loan guarantees. It also would require that, at the inception of a guarantee, the Company must recognize a liability for the fair value of its obligation under that guarantee. The initial fair value recognition and measurement provisions will be applied on a prospective basis to certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN No. 45 will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," (EITF No. 00 21). EITF No. 00 21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF 00 21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in the fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact EITF No. 00 21 will have on its financial position and results of operations. 45 In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN No. 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN No. 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN No. 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN No. 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN No. 46 will have on its results of operations and financial condition. Adequate disclosure has been made for all off balance sheet arrangements that it is reasonably possible to consolidate under FIN No. 46. The Company entered into transactions with ESP and ANGT by which natural gas producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin region of the United States were sold. Appalachian NPI (ANPI) contributed cash and debt to ANGT. The assets of ANPI, including its interest in ANGT, collateralize ANPIs debt. The Company has given to ANPI, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, a liquidity reserve guarantee secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by ANGT for a market based fee. These entities manage the assets and produce, market, and sell the related natural gas from the properties. As of December 31, 2002 Eastern Seven and ANPI had $131.8 million and $289.1 million of total assets, respectively, and $8.5 million and $257.3 million of liabilities (including $213.1 million of long term debt), respectively. The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Eastern Seven and ANPI are $26.1 million and $54.1 million, respectively. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued an exposure draft Statement of Position (SOP) "Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)." This proposed SOP applies to all nongovernmental entities that acquire, construct or replace tangible property, plant and equipment including lessors and lessees. A significant element of the SOP requires that entities use component accounting retroactively for all PP&E assets to the extent future component replacement will be capitalized. At adoption, entities would have the option to apply component accounting retroactively for all PP&E assets, to the extent applicable, or to apply component accounting as an entity incurs capitalizable costs that replace all or a portion of PP&E. The Company cannot evaluate the ultimate impact of this exposure draft until it becomes final. Non GAAP Disclosures The SEC issued a final rule regarding the use of non Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP) financial measures by public companies effective after March 2003. The rule defines a non GAAP financial measure as a numerical measure of an issuers historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that: 1)Exclude amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements. 2)Includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. The Company uses EBIT instead of net income as part of the segment reporting. The Company believes EBIT more accurately depicts the individual financial performance of the segments because both interest and income taxes are controlled on a corporate wide basis and are not fully allocated to the segments. Refer to Note 2 for a reconciliation of the segments EBIT to net income. 46 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has contracted for a market based fee with ANPI, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, a liquidity reserve guarantee secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by ANGT. As of December 31, 2002, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be $18.0 million. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the Company currently believes that the likelihood of making payment under the guarantee is remote. The Company has certain minority investments representing ownership interests in transactions by which natural gas producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin region of the United States were sold. The Company has entered into agreements with these entities to provide administrative, gathering, marketing, and operating services to deliver their gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The total revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company has certain minority investments in certain independent power plant projects located domestically as well as in select other countries. These investments are financed with nonrecourse debt. The Company has entered into agreements with these entities to provide administrative and development services. The total revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. In order to accelerate cash collections, Equitable executes transactions to sell certain contract receivables to a financial institution and a variable interest entity. The variable interest entity is a multi seller conduit that purchases contract receivables from several energy companies. The Company has no ownership interest in or control of the variable interest entity. As further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company does not retain any interest in the contract receivables once the sale is complete. For the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately $46.7 million of the contract receivables met the criteria for sales treatment. Pension Plans Poor equity market conditions that have existed since 2000 have contributed to a significant reduction in the fair market value of the Companys pension plan assets. As a result, the Companys benefit obligation relating to its pension plans is significantly under funded. The Company therefore expects to make contributions of approximately $39 million to the Companys pension plans during 2003. The Company was not required to and consequently did not make any contributions to its pension plans during the years ended 2002, 2001, and 2000. The reduction in the fair market value of the Companys pension plan assets over the last two years, coupled with decreases in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and increases in the amount of unrecognized actuarial losses, has also contributed to a steady increase in the amount of pension expense recognized by the Company. Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2002 and 2001, excluding special termination benefits and curtailment losses, totaled $5.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Excluding special termination benefits and curtailment losses, the Company recognized a pension benefit of approximately $2.6 million in 2000. Total pension expense expected to be recognized by the Company in 2003, exclusive of any special termination benefits and curtailment losses, is $5.8 million. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the PUC, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, and to rate regulation by the Kentucky Public Service 47 Commission. The Companys interstate pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the FERC. Accounting for the Companys regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. Schedule of Certain Contractual Obligations The following table details the future projected payments associated with the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008+ (Thousands) Interest expense $ 778,010 $ 40,983 $ 77,876 $ 75,741 $ 583,410 Long term debt 487,305 40,305 30,500 13,000 403,500 Preferred trust securities 125,000 125,000 Unconditional purchase obligations 222,278 30,931 58,136 55,501 77,710 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,612,593 $ 112,219 $ 166,512 $ 144,242 $ 1,189,620 The Company has the option to call the preferred trust securities on or after April 23, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating this option and may exercise its option, given the proper economic circumstances. Included in long term debt is nonrecourse project financing in the amount of $16.1 million. This amount relates to the Jamaican energy infrastructure project in the NORESCO segment discussed previously. The full amount of the financing is classified as current due to the defaults on various debt covenants, for which the bank may attempt to call the loan. The Company is currently working on various alternatives to refinance or restructure the debt or to pursue strategic alternatives for the potential transfer or sale of the Companys project interests. The indentures and other agreements governing the Companys long term debt contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict the Companys ability to pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, complete acquisitions, sell assets, and certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, in the event that the Companys debt rating changes, this event would not trigger a default under the indentures and other agreements governing the Companys indebtedness. Included within the unconditional purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately $24.1 million relating to the Companys natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing long term contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to six years at December 31, 2002. Approximately $19.1 million of these costs are recoverable in customer rates. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments On October 17, 2002, a jury verdict was rendered against the Company in a civil lawsuit in Knott County Circuit Court, Kentucky. The plaintiff claimed that a well pump house accident that injured him was caused by the Companys natural gas well adjacent to his property. The jury entered a verdict for $50,000 for medical expenses and lost wages and $270 million for pain and suffering and punitive damages. The Company entered into a confidential settlement with the parties dated December 30, 2002. The judge vacated and set aside entirely the judgment as to punitive damages. The expenses 48 related to this litigation and the settlement were substantially insured. The Company did not admit and continues to deny any involvement with causing the plaintiffs accident. There are various other claims and legal proceedings against the Company arising in the normal course of business. Although counsel is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome, management and counsel believe that the Company has significant and meritorious defenses to any claims and intends to pursue them vigorously. The Company has provided adequate reserves and therefore believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. The reserves recorded by the Company do not include any amounts for legal costs expected to be incurred. It is the Companys policy to recognize any legal costs associated with any claims and legal proceedings against the Company as they are incurred. The various regulatory authorities that oversee Equitables operations will from time to time make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the Company. Equitable is not aware of any wrongdoing or irregularities relating to any such inquiries or investigations. In July 2002, the EPA published a final rule that amends the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation. The effective date of the rule was August 16, 2002. Under the final rule Owners/Operators of existing facilities were to revise their SPCC on or before February 17, 2003 and were required to implement the amended plans as soon as possible but not later than August 18, 2003. On January 9, 2003 EPA extended the compliance deadlines for plan amendment and implementation for 60 days with a proposed rule to extend the dates for one year and possibly longer. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this final rule on the Company. The Company is also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which are constantly changing. Governmental authorities may enforce these laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties, assessment and remediation requirements and injunctions as to future activities. The Company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures. Ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements, have not been material. Management believes that any such required expenditures will not be significantly different in either their nature or amount in the future. Any estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued with certain costs deferred as regulatory assets, as applicable. Management does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have a material effect on Equitables financial position or results of operations. The Company has identified situations that require remedial action for which approximately $6.1 million is included in other long term liabilities at December 31, 2002. At the end of the useful life of a well the Company is required to remediate the site by plugging and abandoning the well. Costs associated with this obligation totaled $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.7 million during the years ended 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Inflation and the Effect of Changing Energy Prices The rate of inflation in the United States has been less than moderate over the past several years and has not significantly affected the profitability of the Company. In prior periods of high general inflation, oil and natural gas prices generally increased at comparable rates; however, there is no assurance that this will be the case in the current environment or in possible future periods of high inflation. Regulated utility operations would be required to file a general rate case in order to recover higher costs of operations. Margins in the energy marketing business in the Equitable Utilities segment are highly sensitive to competitive pressures and may not reflect the effects of inflation. The results of 49 operations in the Companys three business segments will be affected by future changes in oil and natural gas prices and the interrelationship between oil, natural gas and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effect of any future changes in natural gas prices, the Company has entered into hedging contracts with respect to forecasted natural gas production at specified prices for a specified period of time. The Companys hedging strategy and information regarding the derivative instruments used are outlined in Item 7A, "Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk," and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Audit Committee The Audit Committee, composed entirely of outside directors, meets periodically with Equitables independent auditors and management to review the Companys financial statements and the results of audit activities. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to the Board of Directors on the results of its review and recommends the selection of independent auditors. Transactions with Directors Affiliated Companies During 2002, Equitable Resources conducted business with PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), where Mr. James E. Rohr, an Equitable Resources Director, serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Company paid PNC a total of $619,637 in fees in 2002 for various services, including commitment fees for a line of credit in which PNC participates with twelve other financial institutions, treasury management fees, and trust fees. The Company also made lease payments to PNC during 2002 totaling $1,472,816, including $872,576 for a lease termination payment, for the financing of communications equipment. Also during 2002, the Companys pension plan for hourly employees paid BlackRock, Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of PNC, $153,565 in ordinary and customary fees for investment management services. The Company has approximately $16 million invested in BlackRock mutual funds for future satisfaction of plugging and abandonment obligations. All of these transactions were on arms length terms believed to be fair in the ordinary course of business and Mr. Rohr did not have a direct or indirect material interest in these transactions. In the course of ordinary business, the Company may have other transactions with companies and organizations for which an Equitable Resources director serves as an officer. Those directors did not have a material interest in any such transactions and none of those transactions exceeded 5% of the gross revenues of either Equitable Resources or the other organization. Moreover, any such transactions were entered into on arms length terms believed to be fair.  Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas, which can affect the operating results of Equitable through the Equitable Supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the Equitable Utilities segment. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company uses simple, nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. For commodity price derivatives used to hedge forecasted Company production, Equitable sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels, which are exposed to price risk. The level of price exposure is limited by the value at risk limits allowed by this policy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. In general, Equitables strategy is to become more highly hedged for production over the next several years at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels. The 50 Company believes that prices between $3.00 and $3.50 per MCF are sustainable. Above this range, non traditional supplies become economically feasible. Furthermore, the Company expects price volatility to result in prices significantly higher and lower than this range. The Company attempts to take advantage of these price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when prices are much higher than the range and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below the range. However, the Company has typically not hedged material volumes unless the natural gas prices exceed $4 per MCF. The goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility. For commodity price derivatives held for trading positions, the marketing group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits. These financial instruments include forward contracts, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. With respect to the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2002, the Company continued to execute its hedging strategy by utilizing price swaps of approximately 227.8 Bcf of natural gas. These derivatives have hedged expected equity production through 2008. A decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2002 levels would increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately $102.8 million. With respect to derivative contracts held by the Company for trading purposes as of December 31, 2002, a decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2002 level would increase the fair market value by approximately $3.9 million. The above analysis of the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk, and as applicable, anticipated transactions occur as expected. The disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. If the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the energy derivatives, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. The Company has variable rate short term debt. As such, there is some limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the Company under its current capital structure. The Company may enter into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to future changes in interest rates, but as of December 31, 2002 the Company had no such instruments outstanding. 51
