Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon Equitables consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Asset Impairment: The Company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable. The Company applies SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (Statement No. 144), in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. This Statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying value, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, because it requires management to make assumptions about cash flows over future years. These assumptions impact the amount of an impairment, which would have an impact on the income statement. Managements assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to do so in the future. The Company reviewed its assets relating to a Jamaican power plant project during the second quarter of 2002, as the project had not been operating at expected levels and repeated remediation efforts were unsuccessful. Additionally, the future projections demonstrated that the losses associated with the assets were likely to continue. The Company determined, through its analysis, that an impairment existed. As part of the impairment analysis, the Company performed a probability cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and compared this amount to the carrying value of the asset. The probability cash flows resulted in a lower fair value than the carrying value, and an impairment was deemed necessary. An impairment of $5.3 million was recorded in 2002. Additionally, the Company holds several investments in nonconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method. Accounting Principles Board No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18), requires a company to recognize a loss in the value of an equity method investment which is other than a temporary decline. The Company analyzes its equity method investments based on its share of estimated future cash flows from the investment to determine whether the carrying amount will be recoverable. This is a critical accounting estimate for similar reasons as those above regarding assumptions about future cash flows. The Company reviewed its equity investment related to Petroelectrica de Panama LDC, an independent power plant project in Panama, during the fourth quarter of 2003 as the project was unsuccessful in securing power capacity contracts. Moreover, the market prices for power supply in Panama make it uneconomical to operate the plant. As a result, the plant was shut down during January 2004. The Company is evaluating various options including the closing of the plant, both temporarily and permanently, and the sale of the plant. As part of the impairment analysis, the Company performed a probability cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and compared this amount to the book value of the equity investment. The probability cash flows resulted in a lower fair value than the carrying value, and an impairment was deemed necessary. An impairment of $11.1 million was recorded in 2003 and represents the full value of NORESCOs equity investment in the project. The Company also reviewed its equity investment in IGC/ERI Pan Am Thermal Generating Limited (IGC/ERI), another independent power plant project in Panama, during the fourth quarter of 2003. Based on the analysis performed, the investment was not deemed to be impaired. IGC/ERI will compete to sign new long term power purchase agreements with customers in the second and third quarters of 2004. The outcome of these contracts will affect the future cash flows of IGC/ERI and could impact a future impairment analysis. The Company 20 will reassess the impairment analysis in late 2004 should the outcome be significantly different than currently anticipated. The book value of the Companys investment in IGC/ERI is $21.7 million at December 31, 2003. Goodwill: Beginning in fiscal year 2002, goodwill was required to be evaluated annually for impairment, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Statement No. 142). This Statement requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired. Step one is to test for potential impairment, which requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value. If the fair value is higher than the book value, no impairment occurs. If the fair value is lower than the book value, step two must be performed. Step two requires measurement of the amount of impairment loss, if any, and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. The resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment must be recorded. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and these changes could cause a material impact to the income statement. Managements assumptions about discount rates, inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions, such as expected growth rate, require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and anticipated future revenues. Additionally, Statement No. 142 requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated. As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill recorded was analyzed for impairment with the implementation of Statement No. 142. In 2002, the fair value of the Companys goodwill (all of which relates to NORESCO) was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information. Based on the analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value recorded for the goodwill. Therefore, the Company recognized an impairment. During the first quarter of 2002, the implied fair value of the goodwill, using the discounted cash flows methodology, was $51.7 million. The carrying value of the goodwill was $57.2 million, resulting in an after tax impairment charge of $5.5 million In the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (Statement No. 143), during fiscal year 2003 and its primary impact was to change the method of accruing for well plugging and abandonment costs. Statement No. 143 requires that the fair value of the Companys plugging and abandonment obligations be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company will increase the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value, through charges to depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A), and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset retirement obligation is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the value of the retirement obligation and related capitalized costs can change from period to period. These assumptions include the estimated future retirement costs and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Additionally, the estimated depletion rates of the related assets determine the period over which the capitalized costs are charged to expense. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded an after tax charge to earnings of $3.6 million as a cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 upon the adoption of Statement No. 143 and an asset retirement obligation at adoption of $28.7 million. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Companys Utility division, Equitable Gas, encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable. As such, Equitable Gas records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision, Equitable Gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable write offs as a percentage of total revenue. This historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis. For 2003, the monthly provision was established at 4% of residential sales. Periodically, the reserve is reviewed for reasonableness. The historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather. Both of these items ultimately impact the customers 21 ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the pass through of purchased gas costs to the customers. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital. The actual weather, commodity prices, and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from managements assumptions and may impact expected operating income. Additionally, management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. Due to the increase in gas commodity rates in 2003, and the colder than prior year weather, customer bills increased from 2002. As a result of this increase, Equitable Gas increased its allowance for doubtful accounts for the first quarter 2003. The provision recorded amounted to approximately 5% of residential revenues for 2003. Performance Plan: The Company accounts for stock based compensation awards under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25). The Company treats its performance plans under which grants were awarded in 2003 and 2002, as variable plans. The actual cost to be recorded for the plans will not be known until the measurement date, which is in December 2005 for the 2003 Plan and December 2004 for the 2002 Plan, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized. The number of shares to be awarded in each plan is dependent upon attainment of certain relative total shareholder return performance goals relative to the performance of a peer group. In the current period, the Company estimated that the performance measures would be met at 130% of the full value of the shares for the 2003 Plan and for 200% of the full value of the shares for the 2002 Plan. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the performance plan is a critical accounting estimate because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the shares, the performance of the peer group and the level of performance by the employees involved. Additionally, the impact on the Statement of Consolidated Income of these changes could be material. Managements assumptions about future stock price and the amount of stock to ultimately be awarded requires significant judgment due to the volatility of the stock market. Pension Plans: The calculation of the Companys net periodic benefit cost (pension expense) and benefit obligation (pension liability) associated with its defined benefit pension plan (pension plan) requires the use of a number of assumptions that the Company deems to be critical accounting estimates. Changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from these assumptions. The Company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. The expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. The Company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the Company at that time, including the pension plans investment mix and the historical and forecasted rates of return on these types of securities. The pension plans investment mix as of January 1, 2003 and 2004 approximated 60% equity securities and 40% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (Statement No. 87). Although the long term rate is intended to be fairly consistent, the Company has reevaluated and reduced the rate in both 2003 and 2004. The expected long term rates of return determined by the Company as of January 1, 2003 and 2004 totaled 8.75% and 8.25%, respectively. Pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases. Therefore, had the Company assumed an expected long term rate of return of 8.25% as of January 1, 2003, the Companys pension expense for 2003, excluding the effect of any settlements paid during this period, would have been approximately $0.5 million higher than the amount recorded. The assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled. In estimating that rate, Statement No. 87 requires and the Company looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed 22 income investments. The Company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of 6.25% and 7.00% as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.25% to 5.75%) would increase the Companys projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2003 by approximately $5.0 million. Additionally, had the Companys discount rate decreased to 5.75% as of December 31, 2003, the Companys net periodic pension expense for 2004 would be projected to increase by approximately $0.2 million, as a significant portion of the pension plans participants are retirees. Variable Interest Entities: On July 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN No. 46). FIN No. 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary requires an analysis of expected losses and expected residual returns by the variable interest entity. This analysis must be made upon adoption and when certain triggering events occur. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the calculations of expected losses and expected residual returns are critical accounting estimates because they require assumptions about cash flows over future years. Managements assumptions about discount rates, growth rates and other internal and external economic conditions require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and anticipated future results. These assumptions impact whether the variable interest entity is consolidated, which would have an impact on the financial statements. The adoption of FIN No. 46 required the consolidation of Plymouth Cogeneration Limited Partnership (Plymouth), a joint venture entered into by NORESCO, and the deconsolidation of EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP (Jamaica), which is the partnership that holds the Jamaican power plant. The consolidation of Plymouth removed the equity investment in Plymouth of $0.1 million and increases minority interest by $0.7 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2003, the Company consolidated $4.7 million in assets and $4.1 million in total liabilities, including nonrecourse long term debt of $4.0 million of which $0.2 million was current. Upon adoption of FIN No. 46, it was determined that Jamaica was a variable interest entity and that the Company was not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Company deconsolidated Jamaica effective July 1, 2003. The deconsolidation of Jamaica removed $17.8 million of assets and $18.0 million of total liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including nonrecourse project financing of $15.9 million, all of which was current. The Company did not establish an equity method investment in Jamaica upon deconsolidation, as the amount of such investment would be less than zero and there is no recourse against the Company beyond its investment in Jamaica. Consolidated Results of Operations Equitables consolidated income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2003 was $173.6 million, or $2.74 per diluted share, compared with $150.6 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, for 2002, and $151.8 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, for 2001. The 2003 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased 15% from 2002 due to an increase in average natural gas prices, gains on the sale of Westport stock, increased equity earnings in Westport prior to the Companys change in accounting treatment for its investment in Westport, an increase in sales volumes from production, less minority interest expense recognized in 2003 associated with the Companys ownership in ABP, and an impairment of the Companys Jamaica power plant recognized in 2002. The improved 2003 earnings were partially offset by an impairment of an equity investment in an independent power plant project located in Panama, costs associated with the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense resulting from an increase in production volumes and the unit depletion rate, an increase in production and leasehold expenses primarily the result of an increase in severance taxes attributable to higher average natural gas prices and an increase in maintenance and other repairs, an increase in interest expense primarily due to a net increase in the amount of outstanding debt, an increase in benefit and insurance costs and the establishment of a community giving foundation. 23 The 2002 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased 1% from 2001 due to the decreased equity earnings in nonconsolidated investments primarily related to the dilution of the Companys ownership percentage in Westport as a result of stock offerings and mergers and acquisitions completed by Westport during the year, lower realized selling prices, increased benefit costs, and an impairment on the Jamaica power plant project. These factors were mostly offset by reduced expenses from 2001 initiatives and process improvements, lower income tax expense, increased drilling, production enhancements, cooler weather and increased commercial and industrial sales. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, excluding Westport, and minority interest. Interest charges and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarter costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive costs and administrative costs totaling $20.4 million, $5.4 million and $8.0 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were not allocated to business segments. The increase in 2003 is primarily related to the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program more fully described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Equitable Utilities Equitable Utilities operations comprise the sale and transportation of natural gas to customers at state regulated rates, interstate pipeline transportation and storage of natural gas subject to federal regulation, the unregulated marketing of natural gas, and limited trading activities. Natural Gas Distribution The local distribution operation of Equitable Gas provides natural gas services in southwestern Pennsylvania and to municipalities and other customers in northern West Virginia. In addition, Equitable Gas provides field line sales (also referred to as farm tap service as the customer is served directly from a well or gathering pipeline) in eastern Kentucky. Equitable Gas is subject to rate regulation by state regulatory commissions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Over the last three years, Equitable Gas has been working with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performance based rate making. Performance based rate making allows the customer and the Company to share in the benefit derived from increased efficiency. In 2001, Equitable Gas received approval from the PA PUC to implement a performance based incentive that provides customers a purchased gas cost credit which is fixed in amount, while enabling Equitable Gas to retain all revenues in excess of the credit through more effective management of upstream interstate pipeline capacity. During the third quarter 2002, the PA PUC approved a one year extension of this program through September 2004. In that same order, the PA PUC approved a second performance based initiative related to balancing services. This initiative runs through 2005. During the second quarter of 2003, Equitable Gas reached a settlement with all parties to extend its performance based purchased gas cost credit incentive through September 2005. The settlement also included a new performance based incentive, which allows Equitable to retain 25% of any revenue generated from a new service designed to increase the recovery of capacity costs from transportation customers. A PA PUC Order approving the settlement was issued in September 2003. In the third quarter of 2002, the PA PUC issued an order approving Equitable Gas request for a Delinquency Reduction Opportunity Program. The program gives incentives to eligible delinquent customers to make payments exceeding their current bill amount and to receive additional credits from Equitable Gas to reduce the customers balance. The program will be fully funded through customer contributions and a surcharge in rates. In the second quarter 2002, the PA PUC authorized Equitable Gas to offer a sales service that would give residential and small business customers the alternative to fix the unit cost of the commodity portion of their rate. 24 The program was developed in response to customer requests for a method to reduce the fluctuation in gas costs. This first of its kind program in Pennsylvania is another in a series of service enhancing initiatives implemented by Equitable Gas. A competitor, Dominion Retail, Inc., appealed the PA PUC order authorizing the new service to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. In September 2003, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania issued an order affirming the PA PUC decision granting Equitable Gas authority to implement the new Fixed Sales Service. To date, Equitable Gas has not offered Fixed Sales Service but will continue to analyze the feasibility of a Fixed Sales Service in the future. Equitable Gas completes quarterly purchased gas cost filings with the PA PUC that are subject to quarterly reviews and annual audits by the PA PUC. The PA PUC completed its most recent audit in 2001, which approved the Companys purchased gas costs through 1999. The PA PUC Audit Bureau has commenced an audit of the 2000 2001 purchased gas period. The on site audit concluded in the fourth quarter of 2003. A final audit report for the 2000 2001 period is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2004. The Companys purchased gas costs for 2000 2003 are currently unaudited by the PA PUC but have received a final prudency review by the PA PUC through 2002 in which no material issues have been noted. Interstate Pipeline The interstate pipeline operations of Equitrans and Carnegie Pipeline are subject to rate regulation by the FERC. In 1997, Equitrans filed a general change application (rate case). The rate case was resolved through a FERC approved settlement among all parties. The settlement provided, with certain limited exceptions, that Equitrans not file a general rate increase with an effective date before August 1, 2001, and must file a general rate case application to take effect no later than August 1, 2003. In the second quarter 2002, Equitrans filed with the FERC to merge its assets and operations with the assets and operations of Carnegie Pipeline. In April 2003, Equitrans filed a proposed settlement with the FERC related to the application to merge its assets with the assets of Carnegie Pipeline. The settlement also provided for a deferral to April 2005 of the August 1, 2003 rate case filing requirement. This proposed settlement was broadly supported by most parties. On July 1, 2003, Equitrans received an order from the FERC approving the merger of Equitrans and Carnegie Pipeline but denying the request for deferral of the requirement to file a rate case by August 1, 2003. In response to the July 1, 2003 order Equitrans filed for and received an extension of time for its rate case filing deadline from August 1, 2003 until December 1, 2003. Also in response to the July 1, 2003 order, on January 1, 2004, the merger of Equitrans and Carnegie Pipeline was effectuated with Equitrans surviving the merger. Equitrans timely filed its rate case application on December 1, 2003. On December 31, 2003, in accordance with the Natural Gas Act, the FERC issued an order accepting in part and rejecting in part Equitrans general rate application. Certain of Equitrans proposed tariff sheets have been accepted subject to a 5 month suspension period, but Equitrans requests for revenue relief were denied. The increase was rejected in large part because Equitrans did not provide cost and revenue data for Carnegie Pipeline. Equitrans is planning to assemble cost and revenue data for Carnegie Pipeline and re file its rate case application in the first quarter of 2004. Consistent with the Companys original December 1, 2003 filing, Equitrans upcoming rate case application will address several issues including establishing an appropriate return on the Companys capital investments, addressing the Companys pension funding levels, accruing for post retirement benefits other than pensions and restructuring its storage services. The Companys request for rate relief is expected to be approximately $18.0 million. In conjunction with the Companys application for rate relief, Equitrans filed a rehearing request on January 30, 2004, seeking reconsideration of the FERCs December 31, 2003 order. Equitrans will continue to explore and evaluate settlement options throughout the pendency of the case. Energy Marketing Equitable Utilities unregulated marketing operations, Equitable Energy, provides commodity procurement and delivery, risk management and customer services to energy consumers including large industrial, utility, commercial and institutional end users. Equitable Energys primary focus is to provide products and services in those areas where the Company has a strategic marketing advantage, usually due to geographic coverage and ownership of physical or contractual assets. The Company also engages in limited trading activity, with the objective of limiting exposure to shifts in market prices. Equitable Energy uses prudent asset management to optimize the Companys assets through trading activities. 25 Historically, Equitable Utilities marketing affiliate purchased and resold a portion of Equitable Supplys production. Beginning January 1, 2003, these marketing activities have been recorded directly in Equitable Supply. The change did not have a significant impact on the Company as a whole; however, there was a significant reduction in the marketing revenues and purchased natural gas costs for the unregulated marketing activities recorded in Equitable Utilities. Capital Expenditures Equitable Utilities forecasts 2004 capital expenditures to be approximately $58 million, a 3% decrease over actual capital expenditures of approximately $60 million for 2003. The 2004 capital expenditures are expected to include 2003 capital commitments totaling $16 million. The total 2004 capital budget includes $43 million for Utilities infrastructure improvements, $4 million for technology enhancements and $5 million for new business development. The infrastructure improvements include improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines as well as storage enhancements. The technology expenditures are primarily related to mobilization initiatives as well as systems enhancements and integration. The new business capital is planned for distribution extension projects. The Company expects to finance its authorized 2004 expenditure program with cash generated from operations and with short term financing. Early in 2004, Equitable Gas successfully implemented a new customer information and billing system for which it incurred $11.8 million of capital expenditures from project inception through December 31, 2003. Total capital expenditures for this project significantly exceeded the original estimate. Though the project exceeded the original estimate, no impairment has been recognized, as the Company believes that all costs related to the project are appropriate and will have future benefit to the Company. The system will be depreciated over a fifteen year period beginning in 2004. Other Equitable Gas contract with the members of the local United Steelworkers union expired on April 15, 2003. The Company and the union have agreed to work under the terms of the expired contract while negotiating a new contract. Results of Operations Equitable Utilities In 2002, the Company classified all gains and losses associated with its energy trading activities to a net presentation for all periods presented in accordance with EITF No. 02 3. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 OPERATIONAL DATA Total operating expenses as a % of net operating revenues 55.17 % 56.33 % 65.77 % Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 60,414 $ 70,188 $ 38,528 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Utility revenues (regulated) $ 408,110 $ 343,847 $ 408,812 Marketing revenues 205,258 410,426 440,246 Total operating revenues 613,368 754,273 849,058 Utility purchased gas costs (regulated) 189,998 131,079 192,109 Marketing purchased gas costs 178,247 389,787 426,207 Net operating revenues 245,123 233,407 230,742 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance expense 51,208 50,335 56,013 Selling, general and administrative expense 56,453 54,249 69,344 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 27,583 26,894 26,404 Total operating expenses 135,244 131,478 151,761 Operating income $ 109,879 $ 101,929 $ 78,981 26 Equitable Utilities had operating income of $109.9 million for 2003, compared with $101.9 million for 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to colder weather in the first quarter of 2003 offset somewhat by warmer weather in the second and fourth quarters of 2003. Additionally, Equitable Marketing experienced an increase in wholesale volumes and margins in both the third and fourth quarters of 2003. These items were offset by an increase in provisions for doubtful accounts and a decrease in storage related revenues in the Pipeline operations. The Distribution operations also experienced increased operating costs in the first quarter 2003 related to the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls incurred due to the cold weather. Capital expenditures decreased $9.8 million to $60.4 million in 2003 from $70.2 million in of 2002. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in new business development spending and mainline replacement. Operating income for 2002 was $101.9 million, compared with $79.0 million for 2001. The improved results for 2002 are primarily due to higher revenues resulting from cooler weather in the fourth quarter 2002, non recurring 2001 charges related to pipeline operations workforce reductions and compressor station automation and an incremental credit related reserve of $7.0 million in 2001. Capital expenditures increased $31.7 million to $70.2 million in 2002 from $38.5 million in 2001 due to increased infrastructure improvement and technological enhancement projects. Distribution Operations Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,829) (a) 5,695 5,258 5,059 O&M per customer (b) $ 290.35 $ 265.98 $ 296.52 Volumes (MMcf): Residential sales and transportation 27,262 25,646 24,753 Commercial and industrial 28,784 29,920 24,500 Total throughput 56,046 55,566 49,253 (a) A heating degree day is computed by taking the average temperature on a given day in the operating region and subtracting it from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each degree by which the average daily temperature falls below 65 degrees represents one heating degree day. (b) O&M is defined for this calculation as the sum of operating expenses (total operating expenses excluding depreciation) less other taxes. Other taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled $2.4 million, $3.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, there were approximately 274,500 customers, 275,000 customers and 273,000 customers, respectively. 27 Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Residential net operating revenues $ 109,821 $ 105,323 $ 103,141 Commercial and industrial net operating revenues 50,660 46,846 44,399 Other net operating revenues 4,705 3,924 7,084 Total net operating revenues $ 165,186 $ 156,093 $ 154,624 Operating expenses (total operating expenses excluding depreciation) 82,068 76,139 84,276 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 20,025 19,933 18,175 Operating income $ 63,093 $ 60,021 $ 52,173 Net operating revenues for 2003 were $165.2 million compared to $156.1 million in 2002. Heating degree days were 5,695 in 2003, which is 8% cooler than the 5,258 degree days in 2002. The colder weather had a positive year over year impact on net operating revenues of approximately $6.3 million. The additional increase in commercial and industrial net operating revenues of $1.7 million is primarily due to increased delivery margins during the first, second, and fourth quarters, despite the 4% decrease in related volumes. The related volumes decreased primarily due to low margin industrial usage and, therefore, had minimal impact on net operating revenues. Operating expenses increased by $5.9 million in 2003 from $76.1 million in 2002. The primary cause for the increase in expenses is due to an increase of $4.3 million in the provision for doubtful accounts, which was recorded at approximately 5% of residential revenues, combined with higher cold weather related maintenance costs from the first quarter 2003 for the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls. These increases were offset by on going cost reduction initiatives. Net revenues for 2002 were $156.1 million compared to $154.6 million in 2001. Heating degree days were 5,258 for 2002, which is 4% cooler than the 5,059 degree days recorded in 2001 and 12% warmer than the 30 year normal of 5,968 as of 2002. The colder weather had a positive year over year impact on net revenues of approximately $2.2 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in late fee revenue due to improved accounts receivable collections. Commercial and industrial volumes increased 22% from 2001 primarily due to the increased sales to steel industry customers. Despite the increase in commercial and industrial volumes, net operating revenues did not proportionately increase due to the relatively low margins on industrial customer volumes. Operating expenses decreased $8.1 million in 2002, or 10%, from $84.3 million in 2001. The decrease is attributable to a $7.0 million charge for incremental credit related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The operating expenses were also favorably impacted by reduced operations and maintenance expenses related to continued process improvement initiatives and reduced collection related costs. The reduced operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by increases in pension and post retirement benefit costs. 28 Pipeline Operations Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 OPERATIONAL DATA Transportation throughput (BBtu) 72,988 70,197 70,693 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Net operating revenues $ 52,926 $ 56,675 $ 62,079 Operating expenses (Total operating expenses excluding depreciation) 23,237 24,744 33,249 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 7,274 6,553 7,872 Operating income $ 22,415 $ 25,378 $ 20,958 Total transportation throughput increased 2.8 million MMbtu, or 4% in 2003 over the prior year due primarily to colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2003 that caused many of the firm transportation contract customers to use the full capacity of the pipeline. Those volumes were partially offset by decreased throughput due to warmer than prior year weather in the second and third quarters of 2003. Because the margin from these firm transportation contracts is generally derived from fixed monthly fees, regardless of the volumes transported, the increased throughput did not positively impact net operating revenues. Net operating revenues from pipeline operations in 2003 decreased to $52.9 million from $56.7 million in 2002. The change in net operating revenues is due almost entirely to a decrease in storage related revenue as a result of firm customer delivery demands in the first quarter of 2003 from colder weather and higher gas prices. In addition, the high gas prices and lower demand in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2003 resulted in the inability to take advantage of commercial opportunities that typically exist. Operating expenses decreased by $1.5 million to $23.2 million in 2003. The decrease is primarily due to planned maintenance charges related to a pipeline maintenance program recognized in the third quarter of 2002 combined with ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Net operating revenues from pipeline operations decreased to $56.7 million in 2002 from $62.1 million in 2001. The decrease is related to the transfer of all of its natural gas pipeline gathering systems to the Equitable Supply segment effective January 1, 2002. The transfer resulted in a reduction of $3.6 million in net revenues and $3.1 million in operating costs. The remainder of the decrease in net revenues is due to extraction revenues from the sale of the facilities and unfavorable transportation margins due to competition. Operating expenses decreased by $8.5 million in 2002 from $33.2 million in 2001. The decreased operating expenses are primarily due to the June 2001 and September 2001 charges for workforce reductions and process improvements related to compressor automation totaling $6.0 million. The cost reductions from the 2001 charges and continued process improvement initiatives favorably impacted the 2002 expenses. These cost savings were offset by the Companys decision to accelerate a pipeline maintenance program. Total operating expenses were also reduced by $3.1 million from the previously mentioned transfer of gathering systems. 29 Energy Marketing Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 OPERATIONAL DATA Total throughput (BBtu) 40,430 169,942 215,541 Net operating revenues/Mmbtu $ 0.6681 $ 0.1214 $ 0.0651 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Net operating revenues $ 27,011 $ 20,639 $ 14,039 Operating expenses (Total operating expenses excluding depreciation) 2,356 3,701 7,832 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 284 408 357 Operating income $ 24,371 $ 16,530 $ 5,850 Net operating revenues in 2003 increased to $27.0 million from $20.6 million in 2002, or 31%, as a result of increased sales for resale off the Equitable Utilities systems, increased unit marketing margins, and the continued focus on high margin sales through storage optimization and asset management. The Equitable Supply segment assumed the direct marketing of a substantial portion of its operating volumes at the beginning of 2003, which had previously been marketed by Equitable Marketing. These volumes, totaling approximately 138,000 billion British thermal units (Bbtu) in 2003, had been marketed by Equitable Marketing at very low margins. Although the assumption of these volumes by Equitable Supply did not have a significant impact on Equitable Marketings net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, it was the primary reason for the significant increase in the unit marketing margins during that same period. Operating expenses decreased by $1.3 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the recovery of a bankrupt customers balance in 2003 that was reserved for in 2002 and a reduction in bad debt expense, as well as continued cost reduction initiatives associated with the Companys decision to de emphasize low margin trading oriented activities. Net revenues for energy marketing operations increased $6.6 million in 2002, or 47%, from $14.0 million in 2001. This increase in net revenues and in unit marketing margins versus 2001 is a result of the Companys decision to focus on storage and asset management activities and continued de emphasis on the low margin trading oriented activities. This decision resulted in the 21% reduction in marketed gas sales volumes in 2002. These increases were partially offset by losses of $2.6 million on transactions marked to market in 2001. Operating expenses decreased 52.7% from 2001 to 2002. The decline in operating expenses is associated with a reduction in workforce due to reduced trading activities in 2002, decreased provisions for bad debts attributable to lower gas prices compared to 2001 and reduced costs associated with retail marketing activities. Equitable Supply Equitable Supply consists of two activities, production and gathering, with operations in the Appalachian Basin region of the United States. Equitable Production develops, produces and sells natural gas (and minor amounts of associated crude oil and its associated by products). Equitable Gathering engages in natural gas gathering and the processing and sale of natural gas liquids. Equitable Supply completed several transactions, which affect the comparability of the financial data between 2003, 2002 and 2001. Prepaid Natural Gas Sales During 2000, the Company utilized two prepaid natural gas sales transactions to limit the Companys exposure to commodity volatility, to reduce its counter party risk, and to raise capital. These contracts are based upon energy content or Btu. The Company converts these to their volumetric equivalents or Mcfe using a factor of 1.05 MMBtu per Mcfe. 30 In December 2000, Equitable sold approximately 26.1 Bcf of future production for proceeds of $104.0 million. This natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability. Under the terms of this sales contract, the Company must deliver approximately 14,300 Mcf per day for five years starting January 1, 2001. The Company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered. In December 2000, Equitable sold approximately 26.6 Bcf of future production for proceeds of $104.8 million. This natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability. Under the terms of this sales contract, the Company was required to deliver approximately 24,300 Mcf per day for three years starting January 1, 2001 and ending December 31, 2003. The Company recognized the revenue from this sale as natural gas was gathered and delivered. The following table details the specifics of the Companys various prepaid transactions. The gathering fee and wellhead price listed are for 2003. The gathering fee received for 2002 and 2001 relating to each transaction was $0.71 per Mcf. The wellhead price received for 2002 and 2001 was $3.28 per Mcf and $3.23 per Mcf for the five and three year contracts, respectively. Total Contract Volume (Bcf) Contract Term Annual Volume (Bcf) Gathering Fee ($ /Mcf) Wellhead Price ($ /Mcf) Annual Revenue (Thousands) 26.1 5 years 5.2 $ 0.72 $ 3.27 $ 20,794 26.6 3 years 8.9 $ 0.72 $ 3.22 $ 34,922 Sale of Oil Properties In December of 2001, the Company sold its oil dominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities. The sale resulted in a decrease of 63 Bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and generated proceeds of approximately $60 million. The field produced approximately 4 Bcfe annually. Sales of Gas Properties Occasionally, the Company enters into a sale of gas properties in order to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility, to reduce counter party risk, to eliminate production risk, and to raise capital, while providing the Company market based fees associated with the gathering, marketing, and operation of these producing properties. In June 2000, Equitable sold properties with 66.0 Bcfe of reserves qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, Eastern Seven Partners, L.P. (ESP), for proceeds of approximately $122.2 million and a retained interest in the partnership. This sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the partnership that is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the equity method of accounting. Under the terms of the transaction, the Companys equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver the partnerships natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term. As the operator of the gas properties in the partnership, the Company may from time to time have receivables outstanding from ESP of up to $10 million. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had receivables outstanding from ESP totaling $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. In December 2000, Equitable sold properties with 133.3 Bcfe of reserves to a trust, Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT), for proceeds of approximately $255.8 million and a retained interest in the trust. This sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the trust, which is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the equity method of accounting. Under the terms of the transaction the Companys equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the trust in order to deliver the trusts natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal. As the operator of the gas properties and as a result of a separate agreement, the Company receives 31 a market based fee for providing a restricted line of credit to the trust that is limited by the fair market value of the trusts remaining reserves. Below is a table that details information associated with the Companys sales of gas properties in 2000 to ESP and ANGT as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Sales of Gas Properties Reserves Sold (Bcfe) Revenue Recognized from Fees Volumes Produced (Bcfe) (Thousands) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 ESP 66.0 9.0 9.6 10.3 $ 8,619 $ 8,522 $ 8,876 ANGT 133.3 13.6 14.2 15.4 $ 15,053 $ 15,442 $ 16,130 In February 2003, the Company sold approximately 500 of its low producing wells, within two of its non strategic districts, in two separate transactions. The sales resulted in a decrease of approximately 13 Bcf of net reserves for proceeds of approximately $6.6 million. The wells produced an aggregate of approximately 1.0 Bcf in 2002. The Company did not recognize a gain or a loss as a result of this disposition. Appalachian Basin Partners, LP In November 1995, the Company monetized Appalachian gas properties qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP). The Company recorded the proceeds as deferred revenue, which was recognized as production occurred. The Company retained a partnership interest in the properties that increased substantially at the end of 2001 based on the attainment of a performance target. Beginning in 2002, the Company no longer included ABP volumes as monetized sales, but instead as equity production sales. As a result, monetized sales volumes decreased by approximately 8.8 Bcf from 2001 to 2002 while net equity sales volumes increased by the same amount. The Company consolidated the partnership starting in 2002, and the remaining portion not owned by the Company was recorded as minority interest. As a result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP in 2002, the Company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to ABP. This resulted in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate during 2002. The nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002 and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future. In February 2003, the Company purchased the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in ABP from the minority interest holders for $44.2 million. The 31% limited partnership interest represented approximately 60.2 Bcf of reserves. As a result, effective February 1, 2003, the Company no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with ABP, which totaled $0.9 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This transaction was approved by the Companys Board of Directors separate from Equitable Supplys original 2003 capital budget program and was financed through short term financing. Capital Expenditures Equitable Supply forecasts its 2004 capital expenditures to be approximately $138 million. This includes $85 million for the development of Appalachian holdings and $53 million for improvements and extensions to gathering system pipelines. The $41.0 million decrease in the development of Appalachian holdings from 2003 to 2004 is to allow Equitable Supply to concentrate on its core assets and insure a proper level of return related to all new projects. The evaluation of new development locations, market forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering system investments. The Company expects to finance its authorized 2004 expenditure program with cash generated from operations and with short term financing. Capital expenditures increased from $147.5 million in 2002 to $204.5 million in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in the level of development drilling in the Appalachian holdings and the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in ABP for $44.2 million. The capital expenditures in 2003 and 2002 included $126.0 million and $114.4 million, respectively, for the development of Appalachian holdings and $34.3 million and $33.1 million, respectively, for gathering system improvements and extensions. 32 Other On October 15, 2003, the Company and the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Industrial Union Local 5 512 reached agreement on a new five year contract. The union workforce provides pipeline and compression services and contract well tending services to Equitable Supply in Kentucky. The terms of the contract mandated increased wages and pension benefits, which will be offset in the Companys results of operations by decreases in overtime. In 2004, Equitable Supply will focus on four main objectives to increase production and sales of natural gas. These four objectives are: (1) reducing bottom hole pressure in each well to the minimum level possible to eliminate impediments to natural gas flow; (2) lowering field pressure to the minimum level that can be economically justified; (3) reducing lost gas to the minimum level that can be justified economically and not accepting unaccounted for gas; and (4) drilling the Companys remaining undeveloped acreage quickly and efficiently to deliver the Companys gas reserves to market.

Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Production revenues $ 262,607 $ 225,713 $ 240,680 Gathering revenues 69,827 63,279 61,598 Total net operating revenues 332,434 288,992 302,278 Operating expenses: Lease operating expenses, excluding severance taxes 21,454 18,141 21,855 Severance tax 13,409 8,123 10,640 Land and leasehold maintenance 824 847 2,005 Gathering and compression (operation and maintenance) 25,110 23,095 24,594 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 27,094 26,873 24,556 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) 48,748 40,711 40,624 Total operating expenses 136,639 117,790 124,274 Operating income $ 195,795 $ 171,202 $ 178,004 Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ 431 $ 282 $ 726 Minority interest $ (871 ) $ (7,103 ) $ Equitable Supplys operating income for 2003 totaled $195.8 million, 14% higher than the $171.2 million earned in 2002. The segments 2003 net operating revenues were $332.4 million, 15% higher than the 2002 net operating revenues of $289.0 million. The increases in Equitable Supplys operating income and net operating revenues were primarily the result of a 13% higher average well head sales price, a 5% increase in equity volumes, and a 10% increase in gathering revenues, the total of which for operating income was partially offset by increased operating expenses. 33 Equitable Supplys average well head sales price realized on produced volumes for 2003 was $3.91 per Mcfe compared to $3.47 per Mcfe for 2002. The $0.44 per Mcfe increase in the average well head sales price was attributable to higher gas commodity prices, increased volumes at higher hedged prices and increased basis over the same period in 2002. The 5% increase in equity volumes was primarily the result of new wells drilled in 2002 and 2003 and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells and the Companys sale in February 2003 of approximately 500 of its low producing wells within two of its non strategic districts. Those wells produced an aggregate of approximately 1.0 Bcf in 2002. The 10% increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to an 8% increase in the average gathering rate billed to equity and third party customers in addition to an increase in the segments equity and third party gathered volumes. Total operating expenses were $136.6 million for 2003 compared to $117.8 million for 2002. The 16% increase was primarily attributable to an increase in lease operating expenses, severance taxes, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses (DD&A) resulting from a $0.09 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes, and higher gathering and compression expenses mainly attributable to an increase in gathering fees paid to third parties. The increase in severance taxes is primarily attributable to higher gas commodity prices. The increase in lease operating expenses is primarily the result of an increase in road maintenance and other repair costs due to severe weather and flooding in 2003, and increases in property taxes and liability insurance premiums. The decrease in minority interest expense of $6.2 million from $7.1 million in 2002 is due to the purchase of the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in ABP from the minority interest holders in February 2003. Beginning in 2002, the Company consolidated ABP, with the portion not owned by the Company being recorded as minority interest. As a result of the Companys purchase of the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in ABP, effective February 1, 2003, Equitable Supply no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with ABP. Equitable Supply had operating income of $171.2 million for 2002, compared with $178.0 million in 2001. The lower results for 2002 are primarily due to a $0.25 per Mcfe reduction in the average well head sales price partially offset by an increase in gathering revenues and a net reduction in operating expenses. The net reduction in operating expenses is the result of a decrease in the severance tax component of production and leasehold expenses attributable to lower gas commodity prices, reduced well tending expenses, lower leasehold costs resulting from improved acreage management, and lower gathering and compression expenses, the total of which was partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in SG&A expenses. SG&A costs remained consistent from 2002 to 2003 as a result of a reduction in legal claims and reserves being offset by a $2.0 million loss incurred during 2003 on the early termination of an uneconomic sales contract. SG&A expenses for 2002 increased from the same period in 2001 due to $3.5 million of costs associated with legal claims and reserves partially offset by productivity improvements. Total sales volumes for 2003 have increased 2.6 Bcfe compared to 2002. While total sales volumes have increased, the amount of the increase has not met the Companys expectations primarily due to volume shortfalls in the southern West Virginia region. Some of the shortfall versus the Companys expectations is related to well performance issues caused by wells drilled in 2002 in less productive areas of the region and negative impacts related to new automation technology and well surveillance. The remaining shortfall is due to more pipeline system curtailments than were forecasted and delays in the timing of pressure optimization and production enhancement projects. As a result, the Company has executed organizational changes that include assigning more engineers directly to operating districts to address production and performance issues through well surveillance initiatives and a reengineered predictive maintenance program. In addition, the Company has taken actions, in the form of adding more firm transportation on the interstate pipeline systems, implementing new pipeline projects to increase the pipeline take away capacity and reliability, and performing historical pipeline and measurement studies to help the Company track and target future shortfalls on an accelerated basis. The Company has also shifted drilling capital to areas where overall results are more predictable and has reduced the overall level of capital in the 2004 capital budget related to the development of its Appalachian holdings as compared to 2003 to allow Equitable Supply to concentrate on its core assets and ensure a proper level of return related to all new projects. 34 Equitable Production Operational and Financial Data Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 OPERATIONAL DATA Net equity sales, natural gas and equivalents (MMcfe) (a) 50,227 47,640 38,825 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 4.10 $ 3.53 $ 3.67 Monetized sales (MMcfe) (b) 14,079 14,079 22,845 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.23 $ 3.27 $ 3.81 Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 64,306 61,719 61,670 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.91 $ 3.47 $ 3.72 Company usage, line loss (MMcfe) (a) 5,501 6,216 5,742 Natural gas inventory, December 31 (MMcfe) 112 Natural gas and oil production (MMcfe) (c) 69,919 67,935 67,412 Operated volumes third parties (MMcfe) (d) 22,619 23,858 25,755 Lease operating expense (LOE), excluding severance tax ($/Mcfe) $ 0.31 $ 0.27 $ 0.32 Severance tax ($/Mcfe) $ 0.19 $ 0.12 $ 0.16 Production depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 0.49 $ 0.40 $ 0.38 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (in thousands): Production depletion $ 33,911 $ 26,970 $ 25,785 Other depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,063 1,417 2,680 Total depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 35,974 $ 28,387 $ 28,465 (a) Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adjusted its method for using a natural gas equivalents conversion factor to convert gallons of liquid hydrocarbon sales to equivalent volumes of natural gas sales.

The increase is primarily the result of a $37.4 million increase in the total of net equity and monetized sales from 2002 due to a higher average well head sales price of $3.91 per Mcfe compared to $3.47 per Mcfe in the prior year ($28.5 million) and increased sales volumes ($8.9 million). The increase in sales volumes is the result of new wells drilled in 2002 and 2003 and production enhancements, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells and the Companys sale in February 2003 of approximately 500 of its low producing wells within two of its non strategic districts in two separate transactions. The wells sold produced an aggregate of approximately 1.0 Bcf in 2002. The Company did not recognize a gain or loss as a result of this disposition. Operating expenses increased $15.8 million or 21% over the prior year from $74.4 million to $90.2 million. This increase was primarily due to increased DD&A costs ($7.6 million), higher severance taxes attributable to higher natural gas prices ($5.3 million), and increased lease operating expenses ($3.3 million). The increase in DD&A was due to a $0.09 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate ($6.2 million) and increased production volumes and other depreciation ($1.4 million). The $0.09 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate is comprised of a $0.03 per Mcfe increase from 2002 drilling costs, a $0.03 per Mcfe increase due to the February 2003 acquisition of the ABP limited partnership interest, and a $0.03 per Mcfe increase due to the January 1, 2003 adoption of Statement No. 143. The increase in lease operating expenses is primarily the result of higher road maintenance due to severe weather and flooding in 2003 and other repair costs ($1.5 million), an increase in property taxes and liability insurance premiums ($1.1 million), and an increase in well maintenance and well surveillance costs ($0.4 million). Total production revenues decreased $15.0 million from 2001 to 2002. The decrease in total production revenues is due primarily to lower effective commodity prices ($15.3 million) and sales of oil properties ($17.0 million), partially offset by increased production from new drilling ($15.5 million) and production enhancements ($1.4 million). Operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2002 decreased 6.0% as compared to the same period in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a 17.0% decrease in lease operating expense resulting from reduced well tending expenses and a 23.7% decrease in severance taxes, which was primarily due to declines in the market commodity sales price. Land and leasehold maintenance costs were also lower, as a result of lower delay rental costs due to improved acreage management. 36 Equitable Gathering Operational and Financial Data Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 OPERATIONAL DATA Gathered volumes (MMcfe) 126,674 123,581 106,832 Average gathering fee ($/Mcfe) (a) $ 0.55 $ 0.51 $ 0.58 Gathering and compression expense ($/Mcfe) $ 0.20 $ 0.19 $ 0.23 Gathering and compression depreciation ($/Mcfe) $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.10 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (in thousands): Gathering and compression depreciation $ 11,711 $ 11,594 $ 10,779 Other depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,063 730 1,380 Total depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 12,774 $ 12,324 12,159 (a) Revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect, process and deliver natural gas from the field where it is produced, to the trunk or main transmission line. Many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price, in which case the Company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Gathering revenues $ 69,827 $ 63,279 $ 61,598 Operating expenses: Gathering and compression expense 25,110 23,095 24,594 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 8,532 7,947 8,349 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 12,774 12,324 12,159 Total operating expenses 46,416 43,366 45,102 Operating income $ 23,411 $ 19,913 $ 16,496 Equitable Gatherings total operating revenues increased $6.5 million or 10.3% from $63.3 million in 2002 to $69.8 million in 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to an 8% rise in the average gathering fee billed to equity and third party customers in addition to a 3.1 Bcfe increase in gathered volumes resulting from higher Equitable Production volumes and new third party customers in southern West Virginia. Total operating expenses increased to $46.4 million in 2003 from $43.4 million in 2002, a 7% increase year over year primarily due to higher third party gathering costs ($1.5 million), other gathering and compression increases ($0.5 million) and higher depreciation ($0.5 million) relating to capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions. Equitable Gathering revenues increased 2.7% from 2001 to 2002, primarily due to a 15.7% increase in gathered volumes offset by a 12.1% decrease in the average gathering fee per Mcfe. The increase in gathered volumes is primarily due to the transfer of the Equitrans gathering pipeline system from the Equitable Utilities segment. The decrease in average gathering fees per Mcfe is a result of a below market rate on the Equitrans gathering pipeline system resulting from the FERC approved spin down. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased 3.8% from the same period in 2001 despite the 15.7% increase in gathered volumes. This decrease was mainly attributable to a 6.1% decrease in gathering and compression costs primarily due to a reduction in third party gathering costs. 37 NORESCO NORESCO provides an integrated group of energy related products and services that are designed to reduce its customers operating costs and improve their energy efficiency.

Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 OPERATIONAL DATA Revenue backlog at December 31 (thousands) $ 134,195 $ 118,224 $ 128,264 Gross profit margin 24.0 % 21.2 % 22.0 % SG&A as a % of revenue 13.3 % 12.4 % 14.7 % Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 307 $ 698 $ 289 Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Energy service contract revenues $ 170,703 $ 190,107 $ 157,379 Energy service contract costs 129,689 149,801 122,790 Net operating revenue (gross profit margin) 41,014 40,306 34,589 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 22,667 23,521 23,112 Impairment of long lived assets 5,320 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,416 1,618 5,952 Total operating expenses 24,083 30,459 29,064 Operating income $ 16,931 $ 9,847 $ 5,525 Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ 2,470 $ 4,699 $ 7,555 Impairment of nonconsolidated investment $ (11,059 ) $ $ Minority interest $ (542 ) $ $ Revenues decreased to $170.7 million in 2003 from $190.1 million in 2002, a decrease of $19.4 million, or 10.2%. This decrease is due primarily to decreased construction activity of energy infrastructure projects versus the prior year. Gross profit margins increased to 24.0% in 2003 from 21.2% in 2002, reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year. Gross profit margin in 2002 included a demand side management program termination of $2.4 million. Gross profit margins trended upwards over the last year due to the focus on more profitable projects especially in the performance contracting contracts and away from less profitable energy infrastructure construction. Revenue backlog increased to $134.2 million at year end 2003 from $118.2 million at year end 2002. The increase in backlog was primarily due to the award of federal government contracts in 2003. Total operating expenses decreased by $6.4 million from $30.5 million in 2002 to $24.1 million in 2003. This decrease was primarily due to the $5.3 million impairment charge for the Jamaica power plant project in 2002 as more fully discussed below. Additionally, SG&A expenses decreased to $22.7 million in 2003 from $23.5 million in 2002. Included in SG&A expenses in 2003 was $0.8 million related to the consolidation of the energy infrastructure and performance contracting groups and included in 2002 was $1.0 million related to office consolidations. The remaining $0.6 million decrease in SG&A is primarily due to a reduction in labor costs. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $2.5 million in 2003 and $4.7 million in 2002 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets. The decrease in earnings was 38 primarily due to decreased earnings from the Petroelectrica de Panama LDC Panamanian power plant because of the expiration of its power purchase agreement. Revenue in 2003 from a replacement agreement has been lower than that recognized in 2002. Earnings were also lower due to the consolidation of Hunterdon Cogeneration, LP (Hunterdon) and Plymouth Cogeneration, LP (Plymouth) in the current year. These consolidations, as more fully described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, required NORESCO to recognize minority interest of $0.5 million in 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reviewed its equity investment in Petroelectrica de Panama LDC, an independent power plant project in Panama, for impairment. See Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates for discussion of the analysis, which resulted in an impairment charge for the full value of the investment of $11.1 million. Revenues increased to $190.1 million in 2002 from $157.4 million in 2001, an increase of $32.7 million, or 20.8%. This increase was due primarily to increased construction activity versus the prior year. Gross profit margins decreased to 21.2% in 2002 from 22.0% in 2001, reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year. Gross profit margins decreased due to competitive pressures and focus on larger projects with lower gross margins. Revenue backlog decreased to $118.2 million at year end 2002 from $128.3 million at year end 2001. The decrease in backlog was primarily attributable to delays in the awarding of government contracts. Total operating expenses increased to $30.5 million in 2002 from $29.1 million 2001. During the second quarter 2002, the Company reviewed the Jamaica power plant project related to the NORESCO operating segment for impairment as the project had not been operating to expected levels and repeated remediation efforts were unsuccessful. The Company owned 91.2% of the equity in the project and therefore consolidated the project in its financial statements for 2002. As a result of the Companys review, an impairment loss of $5.3 million was recorded in 2002 to adjust the project assets to their fair value. During the first quarter of 2003, the plant shut down its engines and terminated most of the staff in order to preserve available cash while discussions among the various parties involved in the project continued, seeking a global settlement. In April of 2003, ERI JAM, LLC, owner of the Companys interest in the Jamaica power plant project, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court (Delaware). In the third quarter 2003, ERI JAM, LLC transferred control under the partnership agreement to the other general partner. Upon adoption of FIN No. 46, it was determined that Jamaica was a variable interest entity and that the Company was not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Company deconsolidated Jamaica effective July 1, 2003. Partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses from the impairment charge, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased from 2001 to 2002 by $4.3 million, primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization of $3.7 million in accordance with Statement No. 142. SG&A expenses increased slightly to $23.5 million in 2002 from $23.1 million in 2001. Included in SG&A expenses in both 2002 and 2001 were $1.0 million related to office consolidations. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $4.7 million in 2002 and $7.6 million in 2001 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to decreased earnings in a power plant in Panama and another one in Rhode Island. Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands) Charitable foundation contribution $ (9,279 ) $ $ Gain on sale of Westport stock 13,985 Equity in earnings (loss) of Westport 3,614 (8,476 ) 17,820 In the first quarter of 2003, the Company established a community giving foundation to facilitate the Companys charitable giving program for approximately 10 years. The foundation was funded through a 39 contribution of 905,000 shares of Westport resulting in a charge of $9.3 million to earnings, with a one time tax benefit of approximately $7.1 million (see Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements). The Company reported $3.6 million in equity earnings from its minority ownership in Westport during the first quarter 2003. At the end of the first quarter of 2003, the Companys ownership position in Westport decreased below 20%. As a result of the decreased ownership, the Company changed the accounting treatment for its investment from the equity method to the available for sale method effective March 31, 2003. During the fourth quarter 2003, the Company sold approximately 1.48 million shares of Westport, resulting in a capital gain of $14.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company owned 11.53 million shares of Westport. Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands) Interest expense $ 45,766 $ 38,787 $ 41,098 Interest expense increased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the issuance of $200 million of Notes in November 2002 and the issuance of $200 million of Notes in February 2003. The stated interest rate for both issuances is 5.15%. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of $125 million of 7.35% trust preferred capital securities on April 23, 2003 as well as lower interest rates on short term debt. Interest expense decreased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to the decrease in interest rates on short term debt. This decrease was partially offset by the higher interest expense associated with the new long term notes issued in November 2002. Average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 1.2%, 1.8% and 4.1% for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Other Items Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement No. 143 which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized by the Company at the time the obligation is incurred. The adoption of Statement No. 143 by the Company resulted in an after tax charge to earnings of $3.6 million, which is reflected as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the Companys Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. In accordance with the requirements of Statement No. 142, the Company tested its goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2002. The Companys goodwill balance as of January 1, 2002 totaled $57.2 million and was entirely related to the NORESCO segment. The fair value of the Companys goodwill was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information. As a result of the impairment test, the Company recognized an impairment of $5.5 million, net of tax, to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value as the level of future cash flows from the NORESCO segment were expected to be less than originally anticipated. In accordance with Statement No. 142, this impairment adjustment was reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the Companys Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required. Income from Discontinued Operations In April 1998, management adopted a formal plan to sell the Companys natural gas midstream operations. A capital loss in connection with the sale was treated as a nondeductible item for tax reporting purposes under the then current Treasury regulations embodying the loss disallowance rule, resulting in additional tax recorded on this sale as a reduction to net income from discontinued operations. In May 2002, the IRS issued new Treasury regulations 40 interpreting the loss disallowance rule that permitted this capital loss to be treated as deductible. During June 2002, the Company filed amended 1998 tax return filings. Consequently, in the second quarter 2002, the Company recorded a $9.0 million increase in net income from discontinued operations related to this unexpected tax benefit. The amended tax return filings are being reviewed during an ongoing regular examination by the IRS of the Companys tax filings for the 1998 tax year. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $121.0 million in 2003 as compared to $214.5 million in 2002. The $93.5 million decrease in operating cash flows from 2002 to 2003 is primarily the result of the decrease in cash provided from working capital due to a large increase in inventory during 2003 as compared to a slight decrease in inventory during 2002. The increase in inventory was mainly due to increased natural gas prices and volumes stored in the current year compared to prior year. In addition, the Company made $51.8 million in pension contributions during 2003. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change, as adjusted to net cash provided by operating activities, primarily due to the performance of the Companys operating segments as previously described. Current taxes were lower as a result of an increase in drilling and development costs for which deferred taxes were provided. When the prepaid gas forward sale transactions were consummated, the Company reviewed the specific facts and circumstances related to these transactions to determine if the appropriate Statement of Cash Flows presentation would be as an operating activity or a financing activity. The Company concluded that the appropriate accounting presentation of the prepaid gas forward sales transactions was as an operating cash flow item. Consistent with the Companys previous presentation, the current presentation includes recognition of monetized production revenues related to prepaid forward gas sales in operating activities. The amount for the both the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 is $55.7 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $214.5 million in 2002 compared to $129.9 million in 2001. The $84.6 million increase in operating cash flows from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP in 2002, in addition to a $36.9 million increase in cash flows from income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change excluding undistributed earnings from nonconsolidated investments, minority interest, and an impairment of long lived assets. The combined change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues, inventory, and accounts payable did not significantly impact the net amount of cash provided by operating activities. Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $214.3 million in 2003 as compared to $169.2 million in 2002 and $125.8 million in 2001. The Company expended approximately $265.7 million in 2003 for capital expenditures as compared to $218.5 million in 2002 and $132.7 million in 2001. Equitable Supply spent $204.5 million in 2003, of which $125.9 million was spent on developmental drilling, $34.4 million was spent on infrastructure projects and $44.2 million was used for the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in ABP in February 2003. The ABP transaction was approved by the Companys Board of Directors separately from the capital expenditure program and was financed through short term financing. Equitable Utilities spent $60.4 million in 2003, of which $42.4 million was spent on infrastructure projects, $13.3 million was spent on technology projects, $4.1 million was spent on business development and $0.6 million on other capital items. Also in 2003, there were several investing activities that provided cash. The sale of approximately 1.48 million shares of Westport stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 provided $38.4 million of proceeds. In addition, proceeds of $4.4 million were provided by the sale of the Companys 50% interest in an equity investment in October 2003 and proceeds of $6.6 were provided by the sale of wells in Ohio in February 2003. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the funding of the Companys pension contribution during 2003. 41 Cash used in 2002 investing activities included $17.6 million invested in available for sale securities intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the Company self insures. Cash provided by investing activities in 2001 included $63.0 million of proceeds from the oil dominated field sale within Equitable Supply. These proceeds were held in a restricted cash account at December 31, 2001 for use in a potential like kind exchange for certain identified assets. During 2002, the restrictions lapsed and the cash was made available for operations. A total of $221 million was authorized for the 2004 capital budget program, as previously described in the business segment results. The Company expects to finance this program with cash generated from operations and with short term debt. See discussion in the Short term Borrowings section below regarding the financing capacity of the Company. Financing Activities Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $112.9 million in 2003 as compared to $57.2 million of cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 and $26.5 million of cash flows used in financing activities in 2001. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2002 to 2003 is primarily the result of increased borrowing in the current year. Short term borrowing activity resulted in a net cash inflow of $93.6 million in 2003 compared to a net cash outflow of $169.4 million in the prior year. In 2002, the $200 million long term debt issuance in November 2002 was used to repay a significant portion of commercial paper and short term loans. The increase in cash flows from short term borrowing activity was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by long term debt as compared to the prior year. The Company issued $200 million of notes in February 2003 with a stated interest rate of 5.15% and a maturity date of March 2018. The proceeds from this issuance were used to retire the Companys $125 million of 7.35% Trust Preferred Securities on April 23, 2003. This provided a net cash increase from the long term debt issuance of $75 million in 2003 compared to a $200 million increase in 2002 relating to the November 2002 issuance of 5.15% notes. Other repayments and retirements of long term debt were $24.7 million in 2003 compared to $0.6 million in 2002. Additionally, loan proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the sale of contract receivables were $45.5 million in 2003 compared to $23.2 million in 2002. Other items impacting cash flows from financing activities for 2003 and 2002 include the Companys purchase of shares of its outstanding stock, proceeds from the issuance of employee stock options and the payment of dividends through the use of cash provided by operating activities. During 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased 1.4 million and 2.9 million shares of its outstanding common stock for $55.2 million and $97.0 million, respectively. Of the 18.8 million total shares authorized for repurchase, the Company has repurchased approximately 16.7 million shares through December 31, 2003. Proceeds from the issuance of employee stock options were $39.1 million in 2003 compared to $28.5 million in 2002 and $6.9 million in 2001. Additionally, during 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company paid dividends on its common shares totaling $60.4 million, $41.8 million, and $40.4 million, respectively. The increase in cash used in financing activities from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of an $82.2 million reduction of proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the sale of contract receivables during 2002 offset by the net of the proceeds from issuance of $200 million of long term debt in the fourth quarter of 2002 to pay down commercial paper and $142.6 million reduction in short term loans. The additional payments on the proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the transfer of contract receivables is primarily the result of the significant amount of transfers done in 2001 and the fact that certain of the Companys debt covenants limit the amount of contract receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time. The $200 million of long term debt issued in 2002 has a stated interest rate of 5.15% and is due in November 2012. Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. Short term loans are used to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season. 42 The Company has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing requirements. Bank loans and commercial paper, supported by available credit, are used to meet short term financing requirements. Interest rates on these short term loans averaged 1.2% during 2003. During 2003, the Company maintained, with a group of banks, a three year revolving credit agreement providing $250 million of available credit, and a 364 day credit agreement providing $250 million of available credit that expired in 2005 and 2003, respectively. On October 30, 2003, the Company replaced its existing credit agreements with a $500 million 364 day credit facility, which will automatically extend to a three year facility upon receipt of an approval of the PA PUC. The Company received the PA PUC approval in the January 2004. The 2003 credit agreement may be used for, among other things, credit support for the Companys commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has the authority to arrange for a commercial paper program up to $650 million. Commercial paper of $199.6 million is outstanding at December 31, 2003. The Companys credit ratings, as determined by either Standards & Poors or Moodys on its non credit enhanced, senior unsecured long term debt, determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit; the lower the Companys credit rating, the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had not borrowed any amounts against these lines of credit. Facility fees, averaging one eleventh of one percent in both 2003 and 2002, were paid to maintain credit availability. The Company believes that cash generated from operations, amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the Company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position, are more than adequate to meet the Companys reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements. Financing Triggers The indentures and other agreements governing the Companys indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict the Companys ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, complete acquisitions, sell assets, and certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, in the event that the Companys debt rating changes, this event would not trigger a default under the indentures and other agreements governing the Companys indebtedness. Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of falling commodity prices. The Company hedges natural gas through financial instruments including forward contracts, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. Equitable has taken advantage of favorable gas prices to significantly hedge production. As of December 31, 2003, the approximate volumes and prices of Equitables hedges and fixed price contracts for 2004 2006 are: 2004 2005 2006 Volume (Bcf) 50 47 45 Average Price (NYMEX)* 4.56 4.65 4.43 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMbtu/Mcf. The average conversion rate associated with the Companys total reported sales volumes for 2003 is 1.11 MMbtu/Mcf before processing. With respect to hedging as of December 31, 2003, the Companys exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices under current market conditions is $0.01 per diluted share per $0.10 change in the average NYMEX natural gas price for 2004 and $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share for 2005 and 2006. Additionally, the Company has hedges through 2010. In addition to monetizations, the Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure. The Company has relied almost exclusively on fixed price swaps to accomplish the remainder of this objective during 2001, 2002 and 2003 due to the increased market volatility. 43 Investment Securities As more fully described under Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments, as a result of the decreased ownership percentage in Westport, in the first quarter 2003 the Company changed the accounting treatment for its investment in Westport from the equity method to available for sale. Investments classified by the Company as available for sale consist of debt and equity securities, including the investment in Westport as of December 31, 2003. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (Statement No. 115), available for sale securities are required to be carried at fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within a separate equity component, accumulated other comprehensive income. The Statement also requires the Company to perform an impairment analysis to assess whether a decline in fair market value below the amortized cost is other than temporary. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the securities must be written down to fair value, as the new cost basis, and the amount of the impairment must be included in earnings. At December 31, 2003, the Companys investment in Westport is in an unrealized gain position. The Companys gross unrealized losses relating to its other securities were approximately $0.2 million. The Company performed an impairment analysis in accordance with Statement No. 115 and concluded that the decline below cost is temporary. Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments Westport The Company owns approximately 11.53 million shares, or 17.1% of Westport, which decreased from 20.8% at the end of 2002. The Company does not have operational control of Westport. The decrease in the Companys ownership in Westport is a result of the Companys donation of 905,000 shares of Westport stock to a community giving foundation on March 31, 2003, the sale of approximately 1,260,000 shares on November 24, 2003 and the sale of 220,000 shares on December 22, 2003. The proceeds from these sales were used to fund contributions to the Companys defined benefit pension plan. The foundation was established by the Company and is projected to facilitate the Companys charitable giving program for approximately 10 years. The contribution resulted in charitable contribution expense of $9.3 million with a corresponding tax benefit of approximately $7.1 million (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). As a result of the decreased ownership, the Company changed the accounting treatment for its investment in the first quarter of 2003 from the equity method to available for sale, effective March 31, 2003. The change in accounting method eliminated the inclusion of Westports results subsequent to March 31, 2003 in the Companys earnings. Also, the Companys investment in Westport was reclassified to Investments, available for sale as of March 31, 2003, and was adjusted to fair market value, in accordance with Statement No. 115. The equity investment at the time it was reclassified totaled $134.1 million. As of June 30, 2003, the Company recorded a reclassification adjustment of $52.9 million to reduce accumulated other comprehensive income and increase common stock to reflect the increases in the book basis of the Companys investment in Westport from previous Westport capital transactions. Therefore, the total mark to market basis of the Westport investment was unchanged as of June 30, 2003, but the increase in common stock value will prospectively reduce any realized gains on the sale of Westport stock by the Company due to the increase in book basis to $16.53 per share, from $10.25 per share. The fair market value of the Companys investment in Westport was $344.2 million as of December 31, 2003 and was calculated based upon the quoted market price of Westport stock on that date. If the Company were to immediately liquidate its investment position in Westport, it would likely be at some discount to the quoted market price. The adjusted cost basis of the investment as of December 31, 2003 is $190.6 million. The increase in the carrying value of the investment of $153.7 million represents an unrealized gain on the investment which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable tax adjustments. Equitable has announced its desire to sell additional shares so that the aggregate number of shares of Westport common stock sold in the six months subsequent to October 2003 equals approximately 3,000,000. The additional sales may occur through an underwritten offering, a registered, negotiated transaction, additional Rule 144 transactions or as otherwise permitted under the Registration Rights Agreement. Equitable is engaged in discussions with Westport regarding appropriate means of effecting these additional sales. The foregoing is subject 44 to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement with Westport. This Form 10 K does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale. The sale of any Westport common stock will be made only by means of a prospectus or pursuant to an exemption from registration. NORESCO In the second quarter 2003, the Company reevaluated its interest in Hunterdon and concluded that the Company effectively controls this equity investment for consolidation purposes. Further, the Company is the primary beneficiary of Plymouth under the rules of FIN No. 46. As a result, the Company began consolidating the financial positions, results of operations and cash flows of Hunterdon effective June 30, 2003 and Plymouth effective July 1, 2003. Hunterdon and Plymouth are considered to be part of the NORESCO segment. The consolidation of Hunterdon removed the equity investment in Hunterdon of $2.5 million and increased minority interest by $2.5 million. As of December 31, 2003, Hunterdon had $7.3 million of total assets, and $3.0 million of total liabilities, including $2.4 million of nonrecourse long term debt of which $0.5 million was classified as current. The consolidation of Plymouth removed the equity investment in Plymouth of $0.1 million and increased minority interest by $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2003, Plymouth had $4.7 million of total assets, and $4.1 million of total liabilities, including $4.0 million of nonrecourse long term debt of which $0.2 million was classified as current. The Company owned a 50% interest in Capital Center Energy Company, LLC (Capital Center), the supplier of power and conditioned air to a mall located in Providence, RI. On October 31, 2003, the Company sold its interest in the Capital Center to the mall owner. The Company recorded an immaterial gain on the sale. Certain NORESCO projects are held through equity in nonconsolidated entities that consist of private power generation, cogeneration and central plant facilities located in selected international locations. When possible, long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) are signed with the customer whereby the customer agrees to purchase the energy generated by the plant. The length of these contracts ranges from 1 to 7 years. The Company has not made an investment since April 2001 and has a total cumulative investment in these projects of $27.3 million as of December 31, 2003. The Companys share of the earnings for 2003, 2002 and 2001 related to the total investment was $2.5 million, $4.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively. These projects generally are financed on a project basis with nonrecourse financings established at the project level. One of the Companys two Panamanian projects, in which the Company owns a 45% interest, Petroelectrica de Panama LDC (Petroelectrica), was a party to a five year PPA, which expired in February 2003. The project debt was fully satisfied in December 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Petroelectrica was unable to secure a PPA for the year 2004 and the plant was shut down in January 2004. The owners are analyzing several strategic alternatives for the project, which include a permanent or temporary shut down of the plant or a sale of the plant. The Company performed an impairment analysis of its equity interest in this project as of December 31, 2003. The result was that an impairment of $11.1 million was recorded and represents the full value of NORESCOs equity investment in the project. The Company owns a 50% interest in another Panamanian electric generation project, IGC/ERI Pan Am Thermal Generating Limited (IGC/ERI). The loan agreement required the project company to retrofit the plant to conform to Panamanian environmental noise standards by a target date of August 31, 2001. Unforeseen events delayed the final completion date of the required retrofits, and the project obtained an extension from the Panamanian government while the government evaluated a land acquisition/rezoning proposal, which, if accepted and executed, would eliminate the need for a retrofit requirement. In September and October 2002, the Panamanian government adopted two resolutions that affected the plants compliance requirements by suspending the noise mitigation deadline while the Company achieved the objectives of the land acquisition and rezoning proposal, and by modifying the noise standards applicable to the plant by making them less stringent. In June 2003, the Supreme Court of Panama found unconstitutional the compliance requirement that modified the noise standards applicable to the plant. A Health Ministry decree applying the less restrictive noise standard in a manner the Company believes does not violate the June 2003 Supreme Court capitalized ruling was issued in January 2004. In October 2003, the creditor sponsor advised the project company that if the less restrictive noise standards are made applicable to the plant, the project company should execute portions of the land acquisition/rezoning proposal and work with a noise control contractor to achieve a partial technical resolution to the noise condition. If the plant is made compliant with 45 the less restrictive noise standard, the creditor sponsor has indicated that it will issue a waiver from the loan agreement requirement and or deem the borrower to be in compliance. In view of the January 2004 decree, the project company expects to execute the land acquisition/rezoning plan in consultation with the creditor sponsor. The expected cost to the project company of achieving resolution of this issue is not expected to exceed $1.5 million and would be funded by project funds. Additionally, IGC/ERI experienced poor financial performance during 2002 due to adverse weather (abnormally high rainfall), other adverse market related conditions, and reduced plant availability related to planned and unplanned outages. These factors depressed revenues, causing a drop below the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant of the non recourse loan document. The project company has been actively coordinating with the creditor sponsor on this matter and during the second half of 2002 and year ended 2003, experienced improvement in operational and financial performance. Despite the debt service coverage ratio issues, 2004 cash flows are expected to cover operating expenses and debt service requirements for IGC/ERI. The Company performed an impairment analysis of its equity interest in this project as of December 31, 2003. No impairment was required. IGC/ERI will compete to sign new long term power purchase agreements with customers in the second and third quarters of 2004. The outcome of these contracts could impact the value of the Companys investment. The Company will reassess the impairment analysis late in 2004. The value of the Companys investment in IGC/ERI is $21.7 million at December 31, 2003. Finally, in 2003, IGC/ERI inadvertently violated a covenant in the project loan agreement, which restricts contracting for certain power sales. The violation was disclosed to the creditor sponsor. The power sales contract that created the violation expired December 31, 2003. Supply During 2000, Equitable Supply sold an interest in oil and gas properties to a partnership, ESP. The Company retained a 1% interest and negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver its natural gas to the market. The Company treats ESP partnership interests as equity in nonconsolidated investments. Also in 2000, Equitable Supply sold an interest in oil and gas properties to a trust, ANGT. The Company retained a 1% interest and has separately negotiated arms length, market based rates with ANGT for gathering, marketing, and operating fees to deliver its natural gas to the market. Additionally, the Company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to Appalachian NPI (ANPI), secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by ANGT. This guarantee is subject to certain restrictions and limitations, as defined in the guarantee agreement, as to the eligibility, amount and terms of the guarantee. These restrictions limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the projects future cash flows from the preceding year end until the termination date of the agreement. The agreement also defines events of default, use of proceeds and demand procedures. The Company has received a market based fee for providing the guarantee. The Company treats its interest in ANGT as equity in nonconsolidated investments. Prepaid Natural Gas Sales In December 2000, the Company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales contracts for a total of approximately 52.7 Bcf of reserves. The Company is required to deliver certain fixed quantities of natural gas during the term of the contracts. The first contract was for five years with net proceeds of $104.0 million and has two years remaining. The second contract was for three years with net proceeds of $104.8 million and was completed at the end of 2003. These contracts were recorded as prepaid forward sales and are recognized in income as deliveries occur. Acquisitions and Dispositions In December 2001, the Company sold its oil dominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities. The sale resulted in a decrease of 63 Bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately $60 million. The field produced approximately 4 Bcfe annually. Although the Company no longer operates these properties, it continues to gather and market the natural gas produced for a fee. During 2003 and 2002, these fees were approximately $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. 46 In February 2003, the Company purchased the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in ABP from the minority interest holders for $44.2 million. The 31% limited partnership interest represents approximately 60.2 Bcf of reserves. As a result, effective February 1, 2003, the Company no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with ABP, which totaled $0.9 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In February 2003, the Company sold approximately 500 of its low producing wells, within two of its non strategic districts, in two separate transactions. The sales resulted in a decrease of 13.0 Bcf of net reserves for proceeds of approximately $6.6 million. The wells produced an aggregate of approximately 1.0 Bcf in 2002. The Company did not recognize a gain or a loss as a result of this disposition. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (Statement No. 143). Statement No. 143 was adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2003, and its primary impact was to change the method of accruing for well plugging and abandonment costs. These costs were formerly recognized as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense with a corresponding credit to accumulated depletion in accordance with SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies (Statement No. 19). At the end of 2002, the cumulative credit included within accumulated depletion totaled approximately $20.9 million. Statement No. 143 requires that the fair value of the Companys plugging and abandonment obligations be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company will increase the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value, through charges to DD&A, and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets. The adoption of Statement No. 143 by the Company resulted in an after tax charge to earnings of $3.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the Companys Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition to the charge to earnings, the depletion rate in the Companys Supply segment increased by $0.03 per Mcfe. The Company also recognized a $28.7 million other long term liability and a $2.3 million long term asset upon adoption of Statement No. 143. The long term obligation represents the net present value of the estimated future expenditures required to plug and abandon the Companys approximately 12,000 wells in Appalachia, significant portions of which are not projected to occur for over 40 years. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of the Companys asset retirement obligations. The Company does not have any assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling these obligations. Year ended December 31, 2003 (Thousands) Asset retirement obligation as of beginning of period $ 28,690 Accretion expense 1,948 Liabilities incurred 431 Liabilities settled (1,289 ) Asset retirement obligation as of end of period $ 29,780 Assuming retroactive application of the change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2002, the pro forma effect of applying this new accounting principle on a retroactive basis would not materially change reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2002. Long term liabilities, assuming retroactive application of the change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002, would have increased by $26.9 million and $28.7 million, respectively. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (Statement No. 146), which supercedes EITF No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employment 47 Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. Statement No. 146 requires companies to record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized only when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal activity. Adoption of this statement was effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 clarifies and expands on existing disclosure requirements for guarantees, including loan guarantees. It also requires that, at the inception of a guarantee, the Company recognize a liability for the fair values of its obligation under that guarantee. The initial fair value recognition and measurement provisions are applied on a prospective basis to certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN No. 45 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF No. 00 21). EITF No. 00 21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF 00 21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in the fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF No. 00 21 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operation or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN No. 46). FIN No. 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Prior to FIN No. 46, entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. FIN No. 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. The Company adopted FIN No. 46 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003 as of July 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN No. 46 required the consolidation of Plymouth Cogeneration Limited Partnership (Plymouth), a joint venture entered into by NORESCO, and the deconsolidation of EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP (Jamaica), which is the partnership that holds the Jamaican power plant. During 1992, NORESCO entered into the Plymouth joint venture to construct, own and operate a cogeneration facility and provide electricity and steam to Plymouth State College. NORESCO originally recorded its interest in Plymouth on the Companys consolidated financial statements as equity in nonconsolidated investments. Under FIN No. 46, NORESCO is the primary beneficiary of Plymouth and began consolidating Plymouth in the consolidated financial statements effective July 1, 2003. The equity interests in Plymouth not owned by NORESCO are reported as a minority interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The consolidation of Plymouth removes the equity investment in Plymouth of $0.1 million and increases minority interest by $0.7 million in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2003, the Company consolidated $4.7 million in assets and $4.1 million in total liabilities, including nonrecourse long term debt of $4.0 million of which $0.2 million was classified as current. NORESCO has a 91.2% interest in Jamaica and has historically consolidated Jamaica in the Companys financial statements. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company wrote off its entire investment in Jamaica due to poor performance. In the second quarter of 2003, ERI JAM, LLC, the entity that holds the Companys interest in Jamaica declared bankruptcy and Jamaica stopped operations. Upon adoption of FIN No. 46, it was determined that Jamaica was a variable interest entity and that the Company was not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Company deconsolidated Jamaica effective July 1, 2003. The deconsolidation of Jamaica removes from the Consolidated Balance Sheet $17.8 million of assets and $18.0 million of total liabilities, including nonrecourse project financing of $15.9 million, all of which was current. The Company did not establish an equity method investment in Jamaica upon deconsolidation, as the amount of such investment would be less than zero and there is no recourse against the Company beyond its investment in Jamaica. 48 The Company also has an interest in a variable interest entity, ANPI, in which Equitable was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2003, ANPI had approximately $266.4 million of total assets and approximately $274.2 million of total liabilities (including $191.7 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. The Companys maximum exposure to a loss as a result of its involvement with ANPI is estimated to be $29.0 million. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN No. 46 (FIN No. 46R) clarifying some of the provisions of the interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of FIN No. 46R for interim periods ending after March 15, 2004. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this revision could have on its financial position and results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Statement No. 149). This Statement amends and clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Statement No. 133). Statement No. 149 amends Statement No. 133 to reflect the decisions made as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) and in other FASB projects or deliberations. Statement No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after September 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after September 30, 2003. The Companys accounting for derivative instruments is in compliance with Statement No. 149 and Statement No. 133. Therefore, the adoption of Statement No. 149 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity (Statement No. 150). This Statement requires that certain financial instruments embodying an obligation to transfer assets or to issue equity securities be classified as liabilities. It is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of Statement No. 150 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (Statement No. 132). This Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits. It retains the original disclosure requirements contained in SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, and requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. This Statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. Accordingly, the additional disclosures required by the revised Statement No. 132 have been included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Interim period disclosures required by revised Statement No. 132 are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). The Act expanded Medicare to include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs. In January 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP FAS 106 1). This position permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Act. As permitted by FSP FAS 106 1, the Company has elected to defer financial recognition of this legislation until the FASB issues final accounting guidance. In accordance with FSP FAS 106 1, appropriate disclosures related to the deferral election have been made in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued an exposure draft Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E). This proposed SOP applies to all nongovernmental entities that acquire, construct or replace tangible property, plant and equipment including lessors and lessees. A significant element of the SOP requires that entities use component accounting retroactively for all PP&E assets to the extent future component replacement will be capitalized. At adoption, entities would have the option to apply component accounting retroactively for all PP&E assets, to the extent applicable, or to apply component accounting as an entity incurs capitalizable costs that replace all or a 49 portion of PP&E. The SOP is expected to be presented for FASB clearance in the first quarter of 2004 and would be applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this SOP would have on its financial position and results of operations. Non GAAP Disclosures The SEC issued a final rule regarding the use of non Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP) financial measures by public companies effective after March 2003. The rule defined a non GAAP financial measure as a numerical measure of an issuers historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that: 1) Exclude amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements. 2) Includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. The Company has reported operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, excluding Westport, and minority interest by segment and by operations within each segment in the MD&A section of this Form 10 K. Interest charges and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. The Company has reconciled the segments operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, excluding Westport, and minority interest to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity earnings from nonconsolidated investment, excluding Westport, and minority interest totals in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the MD&A section of this Form 10 K, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. Equitables management believes that presentation of this non GAAP information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitables segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest and income taxes. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has issued in favor of ANPI a liquidity reserve guarantee, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations, and is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by ANGT. The Company received a market based fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2003, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be $29.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FIN No. 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. The Company has certain minority investments representing ownership interests in transactions by which natural gas producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin region of the United States were sold. The Company has entered into agreements with these entities to provide gathering, and operating services to deliver their gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The total revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company has equity investments in certain independent power plant projects located domestically as well as in select other countries. These investments are financed with nonrecourse debt. The Company has entered into agreements with these entities to provide administrative and development services. The total revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This amount includes six months of Hunterdon and Plymouth. 50 A wholly owned subsidiary of the Company has provided two guarantees in the aggregate amount of $5.4 million in support of a 50% owned non recourse financed energy project in Panama. The guarantees represent 50% of the performance guaranty for the projects principal power purchase agreement and cover a project loan debt service reserve requirement. In accordance with FIN No. 45, the Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee. In order to accelerate cash collections, Equitable executes transactions to sell certain contract receivables to a financial institution and a variable interest entity. The variable interest entity is a multi seller conduit that purchases contract receivables from several energy companies. The Company has no ownership interest in or control of the variable interest entity. As further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company does not retain any interest in the contract receivables once the sale is complete. For the year ended December 31, 2003, approximately $27.6 million of the contract receivables met the criteria for sales treatment. Pension Plans Poor equity market conditions that existed from 2000 to 2002 contributed to a significant reduction in the fair market value of the Companys pension plan assets. As a result, the Companys benefit obligation relating to its pension plans became significantly under funded. The Company made cash contributions totaling $49.6 million to its pension plan during the first three quarters of 2003. In accordance with current funding guidelines, these contributions were designated as 2002 plan year contributions and, in the aggregate, represent the maximum allowable contribution that the Company could make to its pension plan for that plan year. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company made an additional cash contribution totaling $2.2 million to its pension plan. In accordance with current funding guidelines, this contribution was designated as a 2003 plan year contribution. As a result of the cash contributions, the Companys minimum funding requirement is zero for the 2003 plan year and based upon current assumptions, is expected to continue to be zero through the 2006 plan year. The Company was not required to, and consequently did not make any contribution to its pension plans during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The reduction in the fair market value of the Companys pension plan assets over the last three years, coupled with decreases in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and increases in the amount of unrecognized actuarial losses, has also contributed to increases in the amount of pension expense recognized by the Company. Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2003, 2002, and 2001, excluding special termination benefits and curtailment losses, totaled $5.1 million, $5.3 million, and $3.8 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company froze the pension benefit provided through a defined benefit plan to approximately 340 salaried employees. The Company now provides benefits to these employees under a defined contribution plan that covers all other salaried employees of the Company. The decrease in service cost related to the conversion of this benefit plan, coupled with the cash contributions made by the Company in 2003, will decrease the expected amount of pension expense to be recognized by the Company in future years. Total pension expense expected to be recognized by the Company in 2004, exclusive of any special termination benefits and curtailment losses, is $2.3 million. This decrease in pension expense will be partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expense in 2004. Restricted Stock The Company continues to shift its compensation focus from the issuance of stock options to employees towards performance based stock units and time restricted stock awards. Stock options awarded in 2003 decreased significantly compared to those awarded in 2002. Additionally, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors has indicated a desire to fully replace stock options with restricted stock in 2004. Energy Bill As a result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP in 2002, the Company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to ABP. This resulted in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate during 2002. The nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002, and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future. On November 18, 2003, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 (H.R. 6) was passed by the House of Representatives. This comprehensive energy policy legislation, as reported by conferees from the House of Representatives and the Senate, included an extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit for existing qualifying wells and for newly drilled qualifying wells. 51 The Senate was unable to pass H.R. 6 before adjourning for the year due to a lack of votes needed to avoid a threatened filibuster. This comprehensive energy legislation is expected to be addressed by the Senate and House of Representatives during 2004, but any extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit continues to remain uncertain. On September 30, 2003, the enabling legislation for the performance contracting work that NORESCO performs for the federal government under the Department of Energy contracts lapsed and is pending extension in Congress. Until this issue is resolved, the NORESCO segments ability to sign new contracts under the Department of Energy master agreements is affected. However, the Department of Defense has informed NORESCO that it is not interpreting the statutory lapse as prohibiting new awards under existing master agreements. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the PA PUC, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, and to rate regulation by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The Companys interstate pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the FERC. Accounting for the Companys regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. Schedule of Certain Contractual Obligations The following table details the future projected payments associated with the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009+ (Thousands) Interest expense $ 548,999 $ 39,391 $ 76,506 $ 74,456 $ 358,646 Long term debt 653,414 21,267 14,750 11,307 606,090 Operating leases 69,645 6,669 12,594 10,456 39,926 Purchase obligations 197,120 32,620 58,547 45,005 60,948 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,469,178 $ 99,947 $ 162,397 $ 141,224 $ 1,065,610 The indentures and other agreements governing the Companys long term debt contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict the Companys ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, complete acquisitions, sell assets, and perform certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, in the event that the Companys debt rating changes, this event would not trigger a default under the indentures and other agreements governing the Companys indebtedness. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as a limited amount of equipment. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company signed a long term lease for office space with Continental Real Estate Companies, which will own and construct the building in which the office space will be located. Plans call for the building to be complete in late 2004 or early 2005. The office space is located at the North Shore in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and will allow Equitable to consolidate its Pittsburgh office operations and increase efficiencies. The term of the lease is 20 years and nine months and the base rent is approximately $2 million per year. Relocation of operations from locations that utilize space under long term leases will likely cause additional expense late in 2004 and 2005. The base rent payments of approximately $2 million per year have been included in the table above with payments commencing in 2005. Included within the purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately $24.5 million relating to the Companys natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing long term contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to nine years at December 31, 2003. Approximately $19.5 million of these costs are recoverable in customer rates. 52 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments There are various claims and legal proceedings against the Company arising in the normal course of business. Although counsel is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome, management and counsel believe that the Company has significant and meritorious defenses to any claims and intends to pursue them vigorously. The Company has provided adequate reserves and therefore believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. The reserves recorded by the Company do not include any amounts for legal costs expected to be incurred. It is the Companys policy to recognize any legal costs associated with any claims and legal proceedings against the Company as they are incurred. After an extended period of troubled operations, ERI JAM, LLC, a subsidiary that holds the Companys interest in EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP, an international infrastructure project, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court (Delaware) in April 2003. In the third quarter 2003, ERI JAM, LLC transferred control of the international infrastructure project under the partnership agreement to the other general partner. The international infrastructure project was deconsolidated in accordance with FIN No. 46. In September 2003, project level counterparties, Jamaica Broilers Group Limited (JBG) and Energy Associated Limited (EAL), filed a claim against ERI JAM LLC as Debtor in Possession in the Chapter 11 case. EAL is a limited partner in EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP. In October 2003, JBG and EAL also filed a multi count complaint against Equitable and certain of its affiliates in U.S. District Court (Western District of PA). Equitable and its affiliates intend to vigorously defend this litigation, which they view as without merit. Resolution within the Chapter 11 proceedings pursuant to a global settlement is sought. The various regulatory authorities that oversee Equitables operations will, from time to time, make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the Company. The Company has received informal requests for information from the CFTC regarding the reporting of prices to industry publications during 2001, 2002 and 2003. The Company has cooperated fully with the CFTC in this matter as the Company always does when regulatory bodies make requests. The Company has investigated this matter thoroughly internally and uncovered no evidence to date that any of its employees ever intentionally reported any false information to any industry publication. In July 2002, the United States EPA published a final rule that amends the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation. The effective date of the rule was August 16, 2002. Under the final rule, Owners/Operators of existing facilities were to revise their SPCC plans on or before February 17, 2003 and were required to implement the amended plans as soon as possible but not later than August 18, 2003. On April 17, 2003, the EPA extended the deadline to adopt a plan amendment to August 17, 2004 and the deadline to comply with the amended plan to February 18, 2005. There is currently active litigation regarding the final rule and management anticipates that the regulation will be modified. Nonetheless the Company is studying, and is preparing to implement, its plan of compliance. The ultimate outcome of the pending litigation and any regulatory modification may affect the Companys ability to timely comply and will affect the total costs of compliance, currently expected to be $18.0 million, approximately two thirds of which are expected to be capitalized but were not approved as part of the 2004 capital budget. In addition to the SPCC requirement, the Company is subject to other federal, state and local environmental and environmentally related laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which are constantly changing, can require expenditures for remediation and may in certain instances result in assessment of fines. The Company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures. The estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued. However, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets when recoverable through regulated rates. Ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements, have not been material. Management believes that any such required expenditures will not be significantly different in either their nature or amount in the future and does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Any estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued with certain costs deferred as regulatory assets, as applicable. The Company has identified situations that require remedial action for which approximately $4.4 million is included in other long term liabilities at December 31, 2003. 53 At the end of the useful life of a well the Company is required to remediate the site by plugging and abandoning the well. Costs associated with this obligation totaled $1.3 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million during the years ended 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Inflation and the Effect of Changing Energy Prices The rate of inflation in the United States has been less than moderate over the past several years and has not significantly affected the profitability of the Company. In prior periods of high general inflation, oil and natural gas prices generally increased at comparable rates; however, there is no assurance that this will be the case in the current environment or in possible future periods of high inflation. Regulated utility operations may be required to file a general rate case in order to recover higher costs of operations. Margins in the energy marketing business in the Equitable Utilities segment are highly sensitive to competitive pressures and may not reflect the effects of inflation. The results of operations in the Companys three business segments will be affected by future changes in oil and natural gas prices and the interrelationship between oil, natural gas and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effect of any future changes in natural gas prices, the Company has entered into hedging contracts with respect to forecasted natural gas production at specified prices for a specified period of time. The Companys hedging strategy and information regarding the derivative instruments used are outlined in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Audit Committee The Audit Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, meets periodically with Equitables independent auditors and management to review the Companys financial statements and the results of audit activities. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to the Board of Directors on the results of its review and selects the independent auditors. Transactions with Directors Affiliated Companies In the course of ordinary business, the Company may have engaged in transactions with companies and organizations for which an Equitable Resources director serves as an officer. Those directors did not have a material interest in any such transactions and none of those transactions exceeded 5% of the gross revenues of either Equitable Resources or the other organization. Moreover, any such transactions were entered into on arms length terms believed to be fair. 54 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas, which can affect the operating results of Equitable through the Equitable Supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the Equitable Utilities segment. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company uses simple, nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. For commodity price derivatives used to hedge forecasted Company production, Equitable sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels, which are exposed to price risk. These financial instruments include forward contracts, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. The level of price exposure is limited by the value at risk limits allowed by this policy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. In general, Equitables strategy is to become more highly hedged for production over the next several years at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels. The Company believes that prices between $3.00 and $3.50 per Mcf are sustainable. Above this range, non traditional supplies become economically feasible. Furthermore, the Company expects price volatility to result in prices significantly higher and lower than this range. The Company attempts to take advantage of these price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when prices are much higher than the range and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below the range. However, the Company has typically not hedged material volumes unless the natural gas prices exceed $4.00 per Mcf. The goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility. For commodity price derivatives held for trading positions, the marketing group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits. These financial instruments include forward contracts, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. With respect to the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2003, the Company continued to execute its hedging strategy by utilizing price swaps of approximately 219.4 Bcf of natural gas. These derivatives have hedged varying levels of expected equity production through 2010. A decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2003 levels would increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately $108.4 million. An increase of 10% in market price of natural gas would decrease the fair market value by the same amount. With respect to derivative contracts held by the Company for trading purposes as of December 31, 2003, a decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2003 level would decrease the fair market value by approximately $0.05 million. An increase of 10% in market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2003 level would increase the fair market value the same amount. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the natural gas instruments using a method similar to its normal change in fair value as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at December 31, 2003. The price change was then applied to the natural gas instruments recorded on the Companys balance sheet, resulting in the change in fair value. The above analysis of the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term, 55 the energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk, and as applicable, anticipated transactions occur as expected. The disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. If the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the energy derivatives, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. The Company has variable rate short term debt. As such, there is some limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the Company under its current capital structure. The Company maintains fixed rate long term debt that is not subject to fluctuating interest rates. The Company may enter into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to future changes in interest rates, but as of December 31, 2003 the Company had no such instruments outstanding. The Company is exposed to market risk associated with its holdings in Westport, which is accounted for as an investment, available for sale. The Company does not attempt to reduce this risk through the use of derivatives. 56
