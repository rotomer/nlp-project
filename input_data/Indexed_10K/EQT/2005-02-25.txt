Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Equitables consolidated income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2004 was $279.9 million, or $4.44 per diluted share, compared with $173.6 million, or $2.74 per diluted share, for 2003, and $150.6 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, for 2002. The 2004 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased 61% from 2003 primarily due to the gain recorded as a result of the Westport Resources Corporation (Westport)/Kerr McGee Corporation (Kerr McGee) merger as described below. Higher realized selling prices, an increase in sales volumes from production, proceeds received from an insurance settlement, and the gain recorded on the sale of 800,000 Kerr McGee shares in 2004 also helped to improve 2004 earnings. The improved 2004 earnings were partially offset by additional impairment charges recorded in 2004 related to the Companys international investments, an increase in the cost of the Companys Executive Performance Incentive Programs, the gain recorded on the sale of Westport shares in 2003, the costs to settle the cash balance portion of a defined benefit pension plan in 2004, an increase over the prior year in charitable foundation contribution expense, the loss on a 2004 amendment of the Companys prepaid forward contract, warmer weather in 2004, and an increase in interest expense. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 33.8% compared to 32.0% reported for the same period a year ago. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate is primarily the result of the one time permanent tax benefit realized from the 2003 gift of qualified appreciated stock to Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. which was created by the Company to support development programs in communities where the Company conducts business; the 2004 gift of qualified appreciated stock did not generate a significant permanent book/tax difference as the investment was accounted for as available for sale in 2004. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The 2003 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased 15% from 2002 due to an increase in average natural gas prices, gains on the sale of Westport stock, increased equity earnings in Westport prior to the Companys change in accounting treatment for its investment in Westport, an increase in sales volumes from production, less minority interest expense recognized in 2003 associated with the Companys ownership in Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP), and an impairment of the Companys Jamaica power plant recognized in 2002. The improved 2003 earnings were partially offset by an impairment of an equity investment in an independent power plant project located in Panama, costs associated with the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense resulting from an increase in production volumes and the unit depletion rate, an increase in production and leasehold expenses primarily the result of an increase in severance taxes attributable to higher average natural gas prices and an increase in maintenance and other repairs, an increase in interest expense primarily due to a net increase in the amount of outstanding debt, an increase in benefit and insurance costs and the establishment of Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 32.0% compared to 34.0% reported for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily the result of the permanent tax benefit from the 2003 gift of qualified appreciated stock. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments, excluding Westport, minority interest and other income, net. Interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive costs, pension costs, and administrative costs totaling $45.8 million, $20.4 million and $5.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were not allocated to business 17 segments. The increase in 2004 is primarily related to the costs for the Executive Performance Incentive Program more fully described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements as well as the costs to settle the cash balance portion of a defined benefit plan more fully described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has reconciled the segments operating income, equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments, excluding Westport, minority interest and other income, net to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity earnings from nonconsolidated investment, excluding Westport, minority interest and other income, net totals in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. Equitables management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitables segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest and income taxes. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. Equitable Utilities Equitable Utilities operations comprise the gathering, sale, and transportation of natural gas to customers at state regulated rates, interstate pipeline gathering, transportation and storage of natural gas subject to federal regulation, the unregulated marketing of natural gas, and limited trading activities. Natural Gas Distribution Equitable Utilities distribution operations are carried out by Equitable Gas Company (Equitable Gas), a division of the Company. The service territory for Equitable Gas includes southwestern Pennsylvania, municipalities in northern West Virginia and field line sales (also referred to as farm tap service as the customer is served directly from a well or gathering pipeline) in eastern Kentucky and in West Virginia. The distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 276,300 customers, comprising 257,400 residential customers and 18,900 commercial and industrial customers. Equitable Gas is subject to rate regulation by state regulatory commissions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Equitable Gas also operates a small gathering system in Pennsylvania, which is not subject to comprehensive regulation. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PA PUC) mandated asset service life study was filed with the PA PUC by Equitable Gas in May 2004. This study resulted in an increase in the estimated useful life for Equitable Gas distribution main lines and service lines as a result of installing plastic pipe. The PA PUC statutory review period expired in October 2004 with no objection from the PA PUC to modify Equitable Gas asset service life study. As a consequence, the useful life of the distribution main lines and service lines was extended in the fourth quarter on a retroactive basis to January 1, 2004, resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $3.5 million in 2004. Equitable Gas recorded this depreciation expense adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2004. This adjustment did not have a significant impact upon previously reported information. Pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist low income customers with paying their gas bills. The costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers. Equitable Gas has several such programs. In August 2003, Equitable Gas submitted revisions to those programs for PA PUC approval. The revisions were designed to make participation in the low income programs more accessible thereby improving participants ability to pay their bills. In October 2003, the PA PUC approved Equitable Gas revised programs and instructed the various stakeholders to ascertain whether additional funding was necessary to implement the revised programs. Ultimately, consensus was reached to allow the Company to collect an additional $.30 per Mcf to fund the programs. Based on recent billing volumes this would equate to approximately $7.0 million in additional annual revenue. By PA PUC Order of April 1, 2004, the funding mechanism was approved for all residential consumption beginning April 2, 2004, and is expected to remain in place until Equitable Gas seeks authority to change the funding mechanism. This funding mechanism has not had a significant impact on 2004 results because it was approved at the end of the highest volume quarter and during the remainder of 2004 the Company increased spending and focused its collection efforts internally on improving 18 analytical resources to enable the Company to reduce outstanding customer balances. In 2005 and thereafter, it is expected that this mechanism will become a key component in the Companys efforts to reduce bad debt expense. On November 30, 2004, Pennsylvania Governor Edward G. Rendell signed into law the Responsible Utility Customer Protection Act (Act 201). Act 201, which became effective on December 14, 2004, established new procedures for utilities regarding collection activities with respect to deposits, payment plans and terminations for residential customers and is intended to help utility companies collect amounts due from customers. As a result of Act 201, the Company is permitted to send winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250% of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the PA PUC. The Company intends to send termination notices to eligible customers in order to reduce delinquent accounts receivable from customers who have the ability to pay. Other regulatory changes mandated by Act 201 will become effective later in 2005 and beyond and will be implemented by the Company as appropriate. Equitable Gas continues to work with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performance based rate making. In 2001, Equitable Gas received approval from the PA PUC to implement a performance based purchased gas cost credit incentive that provides to customers a purchased gas cost credit which is fixed in amount, while enabling Equitable Gas to retain all revenues in excess of the credit through more effective management of upstream interstate pipeline capacity. This performance based incentive provides an opportunity for Equitable Gas to make short term releases of unutilized pipeline capacity for a fee and to participate in the bundling of gas supply and pipeline capacity for off system sales. An off system sale involves the purchase and delivery of gas to a customer at mutually agreed upon points on facilities not owned by the Company. These revenues are recorded within Equitable Utilities non jurisdictional operations. During the third quarter 2002, the PA PUC approved a one year extension of this program through September 2004. In that same order, the PA PUC approved a second performance based initiative related to balancing services which is available through September 2005. During the second quarter of 2003, Equitable Gas reached a settlement with all parties to extend its performance based purchased gas cost credit incentive through September 2005. The settlement also included a new performance based incentive, which allows Equitable Gas to retain 25% of any revenue generated from a new service designed to increase the recovery of capacity costs from transportation customers. A PA PUC Order approving the settlement was issued in September 2003. This initiative also runs through September 2005. In the third quarter of 2002, the PA PUC issued an order approving Equitable Gas request for a Delinquency Reduction Opportunity Program. The program gives incentives to eligible delinquent customers to make payments exceeding their current bill amount and to receive additional credits from Equitable Gas to reduce the customers balance. The program is fully funded through customer contributions and a surcharge in rates. Equitable Gas submits quarterly purchased gas cost filings to the PA PUC that are subject to quarterly reviews and annual audits and prudency reviews by the PA PUC and its Bureau of Audits. The PA PUC has provided its final prudency review through 2003 in which no material issues were noted. The PA PUC Bureau of Audits commenced a purchased gas cost audit for the 2002 2003 period in the third quarter of 2004. The audit is expected to conclude by the end of the first quarter of 2005. Interstate Pipeline The interstate pipeline operations of Equitrans, L.P. (Equitrans) are subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In the second quarter 2002, Equitrans filed with the FERC to merge its assets and operations with the assets and operations of Carnegie Interstate Pipeline Company (Carnegie Pipeline). In April 2003, Equitrans filed a proposed settlement with the FERC related to the application to merge its assets with the assets of the former Carnegie Pipeline operations. The settlement also provided for a deferral to April 2005 of an August 1, 2003 general rate case filing requirement. On July 1, 2003, Equitrans received an order from the FERC approving the merger of Equitrans and Carnegie Pipeline but denying the request for deferral of the requirement to file a rate case by August 1, 2003. In response to the July 1, 2003 order, Equitrans filed for and received an extension of time for its rate case filing deadline from August 1, 2003 until December 1, 2003. Also in response to the July 1, 2003 order, on January 1, 2004, the merger of Equitrans and Carnegie Pipeline was effectuated with Equitrans surviving the merger. 19 Equitrans timely filed its rate case application on December 1, 2003. On December 31, 2003, in accordance with the Natural Gas Act, the FERC issued an order accepting in part and rejecting in part Equitrans general rate application. Certain of Equitrans proposed tariff sheets were accepted subject to a five month suspension period, but Equitrans requests for revenue relief were denied. The increases were rejected in large part because Equitrans did not provide cost and revenue data for Carnegie Pipeline. Equitrans filed a rehearing request on January 30, 2004, seeking reconsideration of the FERCs December 31, 2003 order, including the FERCs order requiring a certificate filing to replenish certain storage base gas volumes. Equitrans re filed its rate case application on March 1, 2004, complete with cost and revenue data for the former Carnegie Pipeline operations. Consistent with the Companys original December 1, 2003 filing, Equitrans rate case application addresses several issues including establishing an appropriate return on the Companys capital investments, the Companys pension funding levels and accruing for post retirement benefits other than pensions. The Companys filed request for rate relief is for an aggregate annual amount of approximately $17.2 million. On March 31, 2004, in accordance with the Natural Gas Act, the FERC issued an order accepting Equitrans rate application, suspending its tariff sheets until September 1, 2004, and establishing certain procedural parameters for the case. Equitrans began charging the proposed rates for its core services, subject to refund, on September 1, 2004. The proposed rates for Equitrans non core services were moved into effect, subject to refund, on December 1, 2004, pursuant to Commission orders issued on November 23, 2004 and December 30, 2004. Accordingly, Equitrans has set up a reserve believed by management to be prudent, which will be adjusted upon ultimate resolution of the rate case. The Commissions November 23, 2004 order also denied Equitrans January 30, 2004 rehearing request. The Company is seeking judicial review of this order but intends to address the replenishment of the storage base gas volumes in conjunction with the resolution of its pending rate case. Equitrans will continue to explore and evaluate settlement options throughout the pendency of the proceeding. Energy Marketing Equitable Utilities energy marketing includes the non jurisdictional marketing of natural gas at Equitable Gas, marketing and risk management activities at Equitable Energy, LLC (Equitable Energy), and the sale of energy related products and services by Equitable Homeworks. Equitable Energy provides commodity procurement and delivery, risk management and customer services to energy consumers including large industrial, utility, commercial and institutional end users. Equitable Energys primary focus is to provide products and services in those areas where the Company has a strategic marketing advantage, usually due to geographic coverage and ownership of physical or contractual assets. Historically, Equitable Utilities marketing affiliate purchased and resold a portion of Equitable Supplys production. Beginning January 1, 2003, these marketing activities have been recorded directly in Equitable Supply. The change did not have a significant impact on the Company as a whole; however, there was a significant reduction in the marketing revenues and purchased natural gas costs for the unregulated marketing activities recorded in Equitable Utilities. Capital Expenditures Equitable Utilities forecasts 2005 capital expenditures to be approximately $61 million, a 9% increase over actual capital expenditures of approximately $56 million for 2004. The 2005 capital expenditures are expected to include 2004 capital commitments totaling $7 million. The total 2005 capital expenditures include $48 million for infrastructure improvements, $8 million for technology enhancements and $5 million for new business development. The infrastructure improvements include improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines as well as storage enhancements. The technology expenditures are primarily related to the implementation of an automated meter reading system as well as systems enhancements and integration. The new business capital is planned for distribution extension projects. During 2004, Equitable Gas implemented a new customer information and billing system for which it incurred $14.3 million of capital expenditures from project inception through December 31, 2004. The system is being depreciated over a fifteen year period. The new system is expected to help the Company better segment customer information, thereby making it easier for the Company to identify customers eligible for the energy assistance programs and customers for which additional collection efforts are necessary. In 2004, the Company 20 incurred operating costs related to the implementation of the customer information and billing system of $1.9 million and expects to incur additional expense related to ongoing system optimization. Other Equitable Gas collective bargaining agreement with United Steelworkers of America, Local Union 12050 representing 196 employees expired on April 15, 2003. The union has continued to work under the terms and conditions of the expired contract while negotiating a new contract. Equitrans collective bargaining agreement with Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Industrial Union Local 5 0843 representing 26 employees expired April 19, 2004. The union has continued to work under the terms and conditions of the expired contract while negotiating a new contract. Results of Operations Equitable Utilities Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 OPERATIONAL DATA Total operating expenses as a % of net operating revenues 55.44 % 55.17 % 56.33 % Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 56,274 $ 60,414 $ 70,188 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Utility revenues (regulated) $ 431,348 $ 408,110 $ 343,847 Marketing revenues 300,513 205,258 410,426 Total operating revenues 731,861 613,368 754,273 Utility purchased gas costs (regulated) 217,100 189,998 131,079 Marketing purchased gas costs 272,056 178,247 389,787 Net operating revenues 242,705 245,123 233,407 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance expense 52,481 51,208 50,335 Selling, general and administrative expense 56,446 56,453 54,249 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 25,629 27,583 26,894 Total operating expenses 134,556 135,244 131,478 Operating income $ 108,149 $ 109,879 $ 101,929 Equitable Utilities had operating income of $108.1 million for 2004 compared with $109.9 million for 2003. The decreased results for 2004 are primarily due to warmer weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2004. The Distribution operations also experienced increased insurance and legal costs, operating costs related to the implementation of the customer information system and an increase in Pennsylvania franchise tax. In February 2004, a rate moratorium for West Virginia customers expired. The Distribution operations subsequently returned to normal gas recovery rates which led to a decrease in margins for the full year. These decreases were partially offset by increased gathering revenue at the Distribution and Pipeline operations and higher storage related margins at the Pipeline operations. Bad debt expense decreased from the prior year primarily due to a reduction of a regulatory asset in the current year partially offset by increases associated with the implementation of the customer information system in the current year, which resulted in delays in initiating collection activity. Additionally, there was a reduction in the Distribution operations depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses primarily due to an adjustment in the estimated useful life for Equitable Gas main lines and services lines resulting from the PA PUC mandated asset service life study. Capital expenditures decreased $4.1 million to $56.3 million in 2004 from $60.4 million in 2003 due to a decrease in technological enhancement project spending partially offset by increased main line replacement costs and new business development spending. Operating income for 2003 was $109.9 compared with $101.9 million for 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to colder weather in the first quarter of 2003 offset somewhat by warmer weather in the second and 21 fourth quarters of 2003. Additionally, Energy Marketing experienced an increase in wholesale volumes and margins in both the third and fourth quarters of 2003. These items were offset by an increase in bad debt expense and a decrease in storage related revenues in the Pipeline operations. The Distribution operations also experienced increased operating costs in the first quarter 2003 related to the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls incurred due to the cold weather. Capital expenditures decreased $9.8 million to $60.4 million in 2003 from $70.2 million in of 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in new business development spending and mainline replacement. Distribution Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,829) (a) 5,360 5,695 5,258 O&M per customer (b) $ 294.88 $ 290.35 $ 265.98 Volumes (MMcf): Residential sales and transportation 25,520 27,262 25,646 Commercial and industrial 29,597 28,784 29,920 Total throughput 55,117 56,046 55,566 (a) A heating degree day is computed by taking the average temperature on a given day in the operating region and subtracting it from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each degree by which the average daily temperature falls below 65 degrees represents one heating degree day. (b) O&M is defined for this calculation as the sum of operating expenses (total operating expenses excluding depreciation) less other taxes. Other taxes for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $3.3 million, $2.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were approximately 276,300 customers, 274,500 customers and 275,000 customers, respectively. Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Residential net operating revenues $ 104,612 $ 109,821 $ 105,323 Commercial and industrial net operating revenues 48,563 50,660 46,846 Other net operating revenues 5,950 4,705 3,924 Total net operating revenues $ 159,125 $ 165,186 $ 156,093 Operating expenses (total operating expenses excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization) 84,774 82,068 76,139 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 17,474 20,025 19,933 Operating income $ 56,877 $ 63,093 $ 60,021 Net operating revenues for 2004 were $159.1 million compared to $165.2 million in 2003. Heating degree days were 5,360 in 2004, which is 6% warmer than the 5,695 degree days in 2003. The majority of the decrease in net operating revenues is attributable to warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003 that had a negative impact of $4.6 million and a $0.5 million favorable 2003 adjustment as a result of a routine PA PUC audit of Equitables gas cost. Commercial and industrial net operating revenues were down $1.2 million primarily due to the transfer of responsibility for certain commodity margins to Energy Marketing related to the agency program whereby Energy Marketing procures the supply and manages any associated market risk for customers. The transportation responsibility related to these customers remains with the Distribution operations. The related commercial and 22 industrial volumes increased primarily due to low margin industrial usage and, therefore, had minimal impact on net operating revenues. Additionally, in February 2004, a rate moratorium for West Virginia customers expired. The Distribution operations subsequently returned to normal gas recovery rates. This expiration led to a $0.9 million decrease in margins for the full year. These decreases were partially offset by $1.9 million of gathering revenue related to assets transferred from the Pipeline operations during the first quarter of 2004. Of the $1.9 million, $0.5 million related directly to the assets transferred from the Pipeline operations for the full year while the remaining $1.4 million was due to the Distribution operations ability to increase revenue from the transferred assets as a result of improvements to, and further utilization of, existing Distribution gathering facilities during 2004. Operating expenses, excluding DD&A, increased by $2.7 million to $84.8 million in 2004 from $82.1 million in 2003. The increase in operating expenses was due to $1.7 million of higher insurance and legal costs, increased operating costs of $1.1 million related to the implementation of the Distribution operations customer information system (net of decreased mainframe costs of $0.8 million related to the previous customer information system) and an increase in PA franchise tax of $0.9 million. Additionally, as a result of the flooding which occurred in September 2004 due to Hurricane Ivan, $0.7 million of expense was incurred primarily related to increased overtime and contractor costs. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in cold weather related maintenance costs and on going cost reduction initiatives. Bad debt expense decreased by $1.7 million from the prior year due to a reduction of a regulatory asset of $7.5 million in 2004, partially offset by increases of $5.8 million mainly related to delays in initiating collection activity due to the implementation of the customer information system in 2004 as well as increased gas rates in the current year. The reduction in the regulatory asset was due to Equitable Gas having higher than anticipated recoveries for the Delinquency Reduction Opportunity Program through payment and rates. DD&A expense decreased by $2.5 million from 2003 primarily due to an adjustment in the estimated useful life for Equitable Gas main lines and services lines resulting from the PA PUC mandated asset service life study. The adjustment made in the fourth quarter 2004 for the full year resulted in a decrease in DD&A expenses of $3.5 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million related mainly to increased capital in 2004, of which approximately $0.5 million was related to the implementation of the customer information system. Net operating revenues for 2003 were $165.2 million compared to $156.1 million in 2002. Heating degree days were 5,695 in 2003, which was 8% cooler than the 5,258 degree days in 2002. The colder weather had a positive year over year impact on net operating revenues of approximately $6.3 million. The additional increase in commercial and industrial net operating revenues of $1.7 million was primarily due to increased delivery margins during the first, second, and fourth quarters of 2003, despite the 4% decrease in related volumes. The related volumes decreased primarily due to low margin industrial usage and, therefore, had minimal impact on net operating revenues. Operating expenses, excluding DD&A, increased by $5.9 million in 2003 from $76.1 million in 2002. The primary cause for the increase in expenses was an increase of $4.3 million in bad debt expense, which was recorded at approximately 5% of residential revenues, combined with higher cold weather related maintenance costs from the first quarter 2003 for the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls. These increases were offset by on going cost reduction initiatives. Pipeline Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 OPERATIONAL DATA Transportation throughput (Bbtu) 68,929 72,988 70,197 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Net operating revenues $ 55,123 $ 52,926 $ 56,675 Operating expenses (Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, depreciation and amortization) 22,482 23,237 24,744 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 7,985 7,274 6,553 Operating income $ 24,656 $ 22,415 $ 25,378 23 Total transportation throughput decreased 4.1 million MMbtu, or 6% in 2004 from the prior year due primarily to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004. This decrease in volumes was partially offset by increased firm transportation to a third party customer. Because firm transportation contracts, which contain fixed monthly fees regardless of the volumes transported, constitute most of the Pipeline operations business, the decreased throughput did not negatively impact net operating revenues. Net operating revenues from pipeline operations in 2004 increased to $55.1 million from $52.9 million in 2003. The increase in net operating revenues was a result of increased storage margins of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter 2004. Additionally, gathering revenues increased $1.2 million due to increased volumes combined with a rate increase in 2004 compared to 2003. This increase was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease related to the transfer of gathering assets to the Distribution operations in the first quarter 2004. Operating expenses, excluding DD&A, decreased by $0.7 million to $22.5 million in 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in pipeline maintenance charges combined with ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Partially offsetting this decrease, DD&A expense increased by $0.7 million mainly due to increased capital primarily for pipeline replacement and storage enhancement projects. Net operating revenues from pipeline operations in 2003 decreased to $52.9 million from $56.7 million in 2002. The change in net operating revenues was due almost entirely to a decrease in storage related revenue as a result of firm customer delivery demands in the first quarter of 2003 from colder weather and higher gas prices. In addition, the high gas prices and lower demand in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2003 resulted in the inability to take advantage of commercial opportunities that typically exist. Operating expenses, excluding DD&A, decreased by $1.5 million from $24.7 million in 2002 to $23.2 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance charges related to a pipeline maintenance program recognized in the third quarter of 2002 combined with ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Energy Marketing Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 OPERATIONAL DATA Total throughput (Bbtu) 52,366 40,430 169,942 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Net operating revenues $ 28,457 $ 27,011 $ 20,639 Operating expenses (Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization) 1,671 2,356 3,701 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 170 284 408 Operating income $ 26,616 $ 24,371 $ 16,530 Net operating revenues increased approximately $1.5 million in the current year, from $27.0 million in 2003 to $28.5 million in 2004. This increase was primarily the result of higher commercial and industrial margins, which were previously recorded by the Distribution operations. The increase in volumes over the prior year is primarily attributable to higher off system volumes and increased commercial and industrial volumes. Operating expenses, excluding DD&A, decreased $0.7 million, or 29%, from $2.4 million in 2003 to $1.7 million in 2004. This decrease is mainly the result of reduced marketing activities related to home gas products and services, partially offset by higher legal costs. Net operating revenues in 2003 increased to $27.0 million from $20.6 million in 2002, or 31%, as a result of increased sales for resale off the Equitable Utilities systems, increased unit marketing margins, and the continued focus on high margin sales through storage optimization and asset management. The Equitable Supply segment assumed the direct marketing of a substantial portion of its operating volumes at the beginning of 2003, which had 24 previously been marketed by Energy Marketing. These volumes, totaling approximately 138,000 billion British thermal units (Bbtu) in 2003, had been marketed by Energy Marketing at very low margins. Although the assumption of these volumes by Equitable Supply did not have a significant impact on Energy Marketings net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, it was the primary reason for the significant increase in the unit marketing margins during that same period. Operating expenses, excluding DD&A, decreased by $1.3 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the recovery of a bankrupt customers balance in 2003 that was reserved for in 2002 and a reduction in bad debt expense, as well as continued cost reduction initiatives associated with the Companys decision to de emphasize low margin trading oriented activities. Equitable Supply Equitable Supply consists of two activities, production and gathering, with operations in the Appalachian Basin region of the United States. Equitable Production develops, produces and sells natural gas (and minor amounts of associated crude oil and natural gas liquids). Equitable Gathering engages in natural gas gathering and the processing and sale of natural gas liquids. Equitable Supply completed several transactions in 2004, 2003 and 2002, which affect the comparability of the financial data among those years. Prepaid Natural Gas Sales In 2000, the Company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales contracts pursuant to which the Company was required to sell and deliver 52.7 Bcf of natural gas during the term of the contracts. The first contract was for five years with net proceeds of $104.0 million. The second contract was for three years with net proceeds of $104.8 million and was completed at the end of 2003. These contracts were recorded as prepaid forward sales, and the related income was recognized as deliveries occurred. In June 2004, the Company continued to evaluate its capital structure as a result of the anticipated increase in liquidity expected from the Westport/Kerr McGee merger. Based on this evaluation, the Company amended the remaining prepaid natural gas contract, which had been viewed as debt by the rating agencies. The amendment required the Company to repay the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to the undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract. The Companys obligation to deliver a fixed quantity of gas at a fixed price has not changed but the amendment has the effect of increasing the realized sales price for the delivery of gas for the remaining term of the contract. As such, the Company repaid the counterparty $36.8 million, removed the prepaid forward sale from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded a loss in the second quarter of 2004 of $5.5 million in other income, net in the Statements of Consolidated Income reflecting the difference between the net present value of the underlying quantities and the remaining unamortized balance recorded as deferred revenue. Prospectively, through the term of the remaining contract (December 2005), the Company will deliver the required quantity of gas at an effective price of $4.79 per Mcf rather than $3.99 per Mcf as originally stated in the contract. Income will continue to be recognized upon delivery of the gas. Sales of Gas Properties Occasionally, the Company enters into a sale of gas properties in order to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility, to reduce counter party risk, to eliminate production risk, and to raise capital, while providing the Company market based fees associated with the gathering, marketing, and operation of these producing properties. In June 2000, Equitable sold properties with 66.0 Bcfe of reserves qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, Eastern Seven Partners, L.P. (ESP), for proceeds of approximately $122.2 million and a retained interest in the partnership. This sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the partnership that is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the equity method of accounting. Under the terms of the transaction, the Companys equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver the partnerships natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term. 25 In December 2000, Equitable sold properties with 133.3 Bcfe of reserves to a trust, Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT), for proceeds of approximately $255.8 million and a retained interest in the trust. This sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years. The Company retained an interest in the trust, which is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the equity method of accounting. Under the terms of the transaction the Companys equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals. The Company separately negotiated arms length, market based rates for gathering, marketing and operating fees with the trust in order to deliver the trusts natural gas to the market. The underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal. As the operator of the gas properties and as a result of a separate agreement, the Company receives a market based fee for providing a restricted line of credit to the trust that is limited by the fair market value of the trusts remaining reserves. Below is a table that details information associated with the Companys sales of gas properties in 2000 to ESP and ANGT as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Sales of Gas Properties Reserves Sold (Bcfe) Volumes Produced (Bcfe) Revenue Recognized from Fees (Thousands) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 ESP 66.0 8.9 9.0 9.6 $ 9,266 $ 8,619 $ 8,522 ANGT 133.3 13.1 13.6 14.2 $ 15,598 $ 15,053 $ 15,442 In February 2003, the Company sold approximately 500 of its low producing wells, within two of its non strategic districts, in two separate transactions. The sales resulted in a decrease of approximately 13 Bcf of net reserves for proceeds of approximately $6.6 million. The wells produced an aggregate of approximately 1.0 Bcf in 2002. The Company did not recognize a gain or a loss as a result of this disposition. In January 2005, Equitable purchased the 99% limited partnership interest in ESP for cash of $57.5 million and assumed liabilities of $47.3 million. The purchase added approximately 30 Bcfe of reserves. Equitable expects to sell some non core producing properties during the first half of 2005. The net result of the purchase and sale is expected to increase the sales volume at Equitable Supply to 73 Bcfe in 2005. The expected increased revenues will be partially offset by lower other revenues from fees formerly paid by ESP for marketing and operating services. Appalachian Basin Partners, LP In November 1995, the Company monetized Appalachian gas properties qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership, Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP). The Company recorded the proceeds as deferred revenue, which was recognized as production occurred. The Company retained a partnership interest in the properties that increased substantially at the end of 2001 based on the attainment of a performance target. The Company consolidated the partnership starting in 2002, and the remaining portion not owned by the Company was recorded as minority interest. As a result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP in 2002, the Company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to ABP. This resulted in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate during 2002. The nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002 and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future. In February 2003, the Company purchased the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in ABP from the minority interest holders for $44.2 million. The 31% limited partnership interest represented approximately 60.2 Bcf of reserves. As a result, effective February 1, 2003, the Company no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with ABP, which totaled $0.9 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 26 Capital Expenditures Equitable Supply forecasts its 2005 capital expenditures to be approximately $219 million which excludes the $57.5 million purchase of ESP in January 2005. The forecast includes $133 million for the development of Appalachian holdings and $86 million for improvements and extensions to gathering system pipelines. The $133 million targeted to the development of Appalachian holdings represents a $42 million increase in capital expenditures from 2004 to 2005 attributable to an expanded drilling program in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. The evaluation of new development locations, market forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering system investments. Other Equitable Supply implemented a significant change to its business model in late 2004. Previously, Equitable Supply followed an operating cost minimization strategy combined with a moderate drilling program. The Companys new strategy focuses on profit maximization, rather than cost minimization, as an objective. Equitable Supplys previous strategy was based on low price assumptions. To assume low prices, however, in spite of current market conditions, limits opportunities. The margin leverage from realizable gas prices substantially outweighs the modest increase in unit cost structure necessary to utilize this strategy. In the second quarter of 2004, the Company reduced the expected number of wells to be drilled in 2004 from 340 to 320, consistent with the increased focus on infrastructure this year. This change was intended to accelerate sales from existing wells, to reduce the Companys long term requirement for maintenance capital with respect to these wells, and to provide a platform for higher drilling levels prospectively. With the significant and sustained increase in NYMEX natural gas prices during the past several months, the Company re evaluated its growth strategy. By providing for a stable base infrastructure for the current natural gas wells, the Company can benefit from the higher gas prices by obtaining accelerated volumes from the current wells and by increasing the number of wells it intends to drill in 2005 and beyond. At a NYMEX price of $6.00, in addition to the 1,441 net proved undeveloped drilling locations, the Company believes that it has available on acreage it controls, at least 7,000 additional net drilling locations on unproved properties. The execution of this new model will be challenging and will result in higher operating expense, but the Company is committed to improving outcomes through actions such as: (1) significantly increasing the Companys focus on well performance by lowering bottom hole pressure; (2) accelerating implementation and installation of compressor stations and facilities to lower surface pressure; (3) reducing internal and external curtailments of gas sales; (4) reducing lost gas to the minimum level that can be justified economically and not accepting unaccounted for gas; and (5) increasing accountability, ownership and attention to detail in the field and engineering areas. Equitable Supply Operational and Financial Data Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 OPERATIONAL DATA Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 67,731 64,306 61,719 Capital expenditures (thousands) (a) $ 141,661 $ 204,527 $ 147,461 (a) 2003 capital expenditures include the purchase of the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in ABP ($44.2 million) which was separately approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in addition to the total amount originally authorized for the 2003 capital budget program. 27 Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Production revenues $ 315,986 $ 262,607 $ 225,713 Gathering revenues 74,442 69,827 63,279 Total net operating revenues 390,428 332,434 288,992 Operating expenses: Lease operating expenses, excluding severance taxes 26,080 22,278 18,988 Severance tax 17,194 13,409 8,123 Gathering and compression (operation and maintenance) 35,494 25,110 23,095 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 28,455 27,094 26,873 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) 55,836 48,748 40,711 Total operating expenses 163,059 136,639 117,790 Operating income $ 227,369 $ 195,795 $ 171,202 Other income, net $ 576 $ $ Equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments $ 688 $ 431 $ 282 Minority interest $ $ (871 ) $ (7,103 ) Equitable Supplys operating income for 2004 totaled $227.4 million, 16% higher than the $195.8 million earned in 2003. The segments 2004 net operating revenues were $390.4 million, 17% higher than the 2003 net operating revenues of $332.4 million. The increases in Equitable Supplys operating income and net operating revenues were primarily the result of a 14% higher average well head sales price, a 5% increase in sales volumes, and a 7% increase in gathering revenues. Equitable Supplys average well head sales price realized on produced volumes for 2004 was $4.46 per Mcfe compared to $3.91 per Mcfe for 2003. The $0.55 per Mcfe increase in the average well head sales price was attributable to higher gas commodity prices, increased volumes at higher hedged prices and increased basis over the same period in 2003. The 5% increase in sales volumes was primarily the result of new wells drilled in 2003 and 2004 and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells. The 7% increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to a 5% increase in the average gathering rate and higher Equitable Production sales volumes, partially offset by third party customer volume shut ins. Total operating expenses were $163.1 million for 2004 compared to $136.6 million for 2003, an increase of 19%. The increase in gathering and compression costs was primarily attributable to an increase in compressor station operation and repair costs, field labor and related employments costs, field line maintenance costs and compressor electricity charges. The increase in DD&A resulted from a $0.05 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes. The increase in severance taxes (a tax imposed on the value of gas extracted) was primarily attributable to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily the result of a charge for environmental site assessments and increased property taxes and liability insurance premiums. The increase in SG&A was due to increased franchise taxes in 2004. Other income, net was the result of a $6.1 million settlement received from a previously disputed insurance coverage claim, offset by a $5.5 million expense related to the Companys settlement of its prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004. Capital expenditures decreased from $204.5 million in 2003 to $141.7 million in 2004 primarily as a result of a decrease in the level of development drilling in the Appalachian holdings to allow Equitable Supply to concentrate on its core assets and insure a proper level of return on all new projects. The capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003 included $91.5 million and $126.0 million, respectively, for the development of Appalachian holdings and $50.2 million and $34.3 million, respectively, for gathering system improvements and extensions. Equitable Supply had operating income of $195.8 million for 2003, compared with $171.2 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a $0.44 per Mcfe increase in average well head sales price, a 4% increase in sales volumes and a 10% increase in revenues from gathering partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. The net increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in lease operating expenses, severance taxes, higher DD&A resulting from a $0.09 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes, 28 and higher gathering and compression expenses mainly attributable to an increase in gathering fees paid to third parties. The increase in severance taxes was primarily attributable to higher gas commodity prices. The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily the result of an increase in road maintenance and other repair costs due to severe weather and flooding in 2003, and increases in property taxes and liability insurance premiums. SG&A costs remained consistent from 2002 to 2003 as a result of a reduction in legal claims and reserves being offset by a $2.0 million loss incurred during 2003 on the early termination of an uneconomic sales contract. Capital expenditures increased from $147.5 million in 2002 to $204.5 million in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in the level of development drilling in the Appalachian holdings and the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in ABP for $44.2 million. The capital expenditures in 2003 and 2002 included $126.0 million and $114.4 million, respectively, for the development of Appalachian holdings and $34.3 million and $33.1 million, respectively, for gathering system improvements and extensions.

This change results in an additional 0.3 Bcfe natural gas sales volume and a corresponding reduction to reported Company usage and line loss for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in Company usage and line loss for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily due to improved meter calibration on the Companys wells. (b) Natural gas and oil production represents the Companys interest in gas and oil production measured at the well head. It is equal to the sum of total sales volumes, Company usage, line loss, and natural gas inventory. (c) Includes volumes in which interests were sold but which the Company still operates for third parties for a fee. See the ESP and ANGT table in the Sale of Gas Properties section for additional information. 29 Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 FINANCIAL DATA (Thousands) Production revenues $ 302,287 $ 251,658 $ 214,225 Other revenue 13,699 10,949 11,488 Total production revenues 315,986 262,607 225,713 Operating expenses: Lease operating expense, excluding severance taxes 26,080 22,278 18,988 Severance tax 17,194 13,409 8,123 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 18,780 18,562 18,926 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) 41,275 35,974 28,387 Total operating expenses 103,329 90,223 74,424 Operating income $ 212,657 $ 172,384 $ 151,289 Other income, net $ 576 $ $ Equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments $ 688 $ 431 $ 282 Minority interest $ $ (871 ) $ (7,103 ) Equitable Productions total production revenues, which are derived primarily from the sale of produced natural gas, increased $53.4 million from 2003 to 2004. The increase was primarily the result of a 14% increase in the average well head sales price of $4.46 per Mcfe compared to $3.91 per Mcfe in the prior year and increased sales volumes of 3.4 Bcfe. The increase in sales volumes was the result of new wells drilled in 2003 and 2004, reduction in the average line pressure in the gathering system by 13%, and production enhancements, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells. Production operating revenues were also positively impacted in 2004 by the recognition of a gain of $2.7 million that resulted from the renegotiation of a processing agreement. The Company received approximately $3.3 million from a contract buydown fee related to the renegotiation of a pre existing liquids processing agreement from a make whole arrangement to a processing fee arrangement. Under the terms of the new agreement, Equitable will have increased exposure to liquids prices and will pay a fee on volumes processed. This $3.3 million was partially offset by a $0.6 million write down of certain plant assets that no longer have future economic value under the new agreement. Operating expenses increased $13.1 million or 15% over the prior year from $90.2 million to $103.3 million. This increase was primarily due to a $5.3 million increase in DD&A costs, a $3.8 million increase in severance taxes attributable to higher natural gas prices and increased sales volume, and a $3.8 million increase in lease operating expenses. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to a $0.05 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes. The $0.05 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate was the result of the net development capital additions in 2003 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base. The increase in lease operating expenses was due to a charge to earnings for environmental site assessments performed in accordance with the Companys amended Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) compliance plan, and increased property taxes and liability insurance premiums. In general, the higher cost structure reflects the change in the strategy from cost minimization previously addressed. Other income, net was the result of a $6.1 million settlement received from a disputed insurance coverage claim, offset by a $5.5 million expense related to the Companys amendment of its prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004. Total production revenues increased $36.9 million from 2002 to 2003. The increase was primarily the result of a $37.4 million increase in production revenues from 2002 due to a higher average well head sales price of $3.91 per Mcfe compared to $3.47 per Mcfe in the prior year and increased sales volumes of 2.6 Bcfe. 30 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 21% as compared to the same period in 2002. This increase was primarily due to a $7.6 million increase in DD&A costs, $5.3 million in higher severance taxes attributable to higher natural gas prices, and a $3.3 million increase in lease operating expenses.

The 7% increase in total operating revenues was primarily attributable to a 6% rise in the average gathering fee and a 0.7 Bcf increase in gathered volumes. The increase in gathered volumes was the result of higher Equitable Production sales volumes, partially offset by third party customer volume shut ins caused by extended maintenance projects on interstate pipelines. Total operating expenses increased $13.3 million or 29% from $46.4 million in 2003 to $59.7 million in 2004. The increase resulted from a $10.4 million increase in gathering and compression costs, a $1.8 million increase in depreciation relating to capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions, and a $1.1 million increase in SG&A expense. The increase in gathering and compression costs was primarily attributable to an increase in compressor station operation and repair costs, field labor and related employment costs, field line maintenance costs and compressor electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors. The additional compression costs resulted from a 24% increase in horsepower (hp) to approximately 112,000 hp in 2004 from approximately 90,000 hp in 2003. The increase in field labor was due to an increase in headcount related to Equitable Gatherings current strategy to spend more time and resources to aggressively tend to the improvement of the base infrastructure. Actions taken by Equitable Gathering to support this strategy, such as the installation of compressor stations and facilities to reduce surface pressure and efforts related to reducing the internal curtailment 31 of gas sales, have increased compression and field line maintenance costs in 2004. Equitable Gathering will pursue recovery of the increased cost to provide gathering services through the rates it charges to its customers. The increase in SG&A costs was primarily attributable to an increase in franchise taxes due to an increase in the tax base. Equitable Gatherings total operating revenues increased $6.5 million or 10% from $63.3 million in 2002 to $69.8 million in 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to a 8% rise in the average gathering fee billed to equity and third party customers in addition to a 3.1 Bcfe increase in gathered volumes resulting from higher Equitable Production volumes and new third party customers in southern West Virginia. Total operating expenses increased to $46.4 million in 2003 from $43.4 million in 2002, a 7% increase year over year primarily due to higher third party gathering costs, other gathering and compression expense increases and higher depreciation relating to capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions.

This decrease was due primarily to decreased construction activity mainly related to reduced sales during the year. Gross profit margin decreased to $39.3 million compared to $41.0 million in the same period last year. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 27% in 2004 from 24% in 2003 reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year. Revenue backlog decreased to $83.5 million at year end 2004 from $134.2 million at year end 2003. This decrease in backlog was primarily due to the inability to contract with the federal government between September 30, 2003 and October 28, 2004. Total operating expenses increased by $0.3 million from $24.1 million in 2003 to $24.4 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in SG&A expenses which includes expenses related to the litigation regarding EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP (Jamaica). Included in SG&A expenses in 2003 was $0.8 million related to the consolidation of the energy infrastructure and performance contracting groups. Excluding these isolated items, SG&A expenses were flat compared to prior year. During the second quarter of 2004, several negative circumstances caused the Company to evaluate its international investments for additional impairments and to accelerate its plans to exit the international generation business. See Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information regarding the $39.6 million impairment charge recorded in 2004. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $1.2 million in 2004 and $2.5 million in 2003 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets. The decrease in earnings from 2003 was primarily due to the Companys strategy to exit the international generation business. The Company began recording minority interest expense upon the consolidation of Hunterdon Cogeneration LP (Hunterdon) in June 2003. The increase in minority interest expense from $0.5 million in 2003 to $1.0 million in 2004 was due to the consolidation of Hunterdon for six months in 2003 versus a full calendar year in 2004. Revenues decreased to $170.7 million in 2003 from $190.1 million in 2002, a decrease of $19.4 million, or 10%. This decrease was due primarily to decreased construction activity for energy infrastructure projects versus 2002. Gross profit margins increased to 24% in 2003 from 21% in 2002, reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year. Gross profit margin in 2002 included a demand side management program that contributed $2.4 million in 2002 and was terminated at the end of the year. Gross profit margins trended upwards over 2002 due to the focus on more profitable performance contracting contracts as contrasted with less profitable energy infrastructure construction. Revenue backlog increased to $134.2 million at year end 2003 from $118.2 million at year end 2002. The increase in backlog was primarily due to the award of federal government contracts in 2003. Total operating expenses decreased by $6.4 million from $30.5 million in 2002 to $24.1 million in 2003. This decrease was primarily due to the $5.3 million impairment charge for the Jamaica power plant project in 2002. Additionally, SG&A expenses decreased to $22.7 million in 2003 from $23.5 million in 2002. Included in SG&A expenses in 2003 was $0.8 million related to the consolidation of the energy infrastructure and performance contracting groups and included in 2002 was $1.0 million related to office consolidations. The remaining $0.6 million decrease in SG&A was primarily due to a reduction in labor costs. Equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $2.5 million in 2003 and $4.7 million in 2002 reflects NORESCOs share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to decreased earnings from the Petroelectrica de Panama LDC Panamanian power plant because of the expiration of its power purchase agreement. Revenue in 2003 from a replacement agreement was lower than that recognized in 2002. Earnings were also lower due to the consolidation of Hunterdon Cogeneration, LP (Hunterdon) and Plymouth Cogeneration, LP (Plymouth) in 2003. These consolidations, as more fully described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, required NORESCO to recognize minority interest expense of $0.5 million in 2003. 33 The Company reviewed its equity investment related to Petroelectrica de Panama LDC, an independent power plant in Panama, during the fourth quarter of 2003. As a result of the analysis performed, an impairment of $11.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 was recorded which represented the full value of NORESCOs equity investment in the project. Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands) Gain on exchange of Westport for Kerr McGee shares $ 217,212 $ $ Charitable foundation contribution (18,226 ) (9,279 ) Gain on sale of available for sale securities 3,024 13,985 Other income, net 3,692 Equity earnings (loss) of Westport 3,614 (8,476 ) As a result of the April 7, 2004 merger between Westport and Kerr McGee, the Company recognized a gain of $217.2 million on the exchange of its Westport shares for Kerr McGee shares. See Note 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further information on this transaction. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company established Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. to facilitate the Companys charitable giving program. This foundation received additional funding in the second quarter of 2004. See Note 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the charitable foundation contribution expense recorded upon contributions of Kerr McGee and Westport shares made to this foundation during 2004 and 2003. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company sold 800,000 Kerr McGee shares resulting in a gain of $3.0 million. During the fourth quarter 2003, the Company sold approximately 1.48 million shares of Westport, resulting in a gain of $14.0 million. Other income, net includes $3.1 million of pre tax dividend income recorded in 2004 relating to the Companys 7.0 million Kerr McGee shares. See section titled Equitable Supply for discussion of the remaining $0.6 million of other income related to Equitable Production. The Company reported $3.6 million in equity earnings from its minority ownership in Westport during the first quarter 2003. At the end of the first quarter of 2003, the Companys ownership position in Westport decreased below 20%. As a result of the decreased ownership, the Company changed the accounting treatment for its investment from the equity method to the available for sale method effective March 31, 2003. Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands) Interest expense $ 49,247 $ 45,766 $ 38,787 Interest expense increased by $3.4 million from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in short term borrowing activity during 2004 as well as an increase in the average annual short term debt interest rate. Interest expense increased by $7.0 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the issuance of $200 million of Notes in November 2002 and the issuance of $200 million of Notes in February 2003. The stated interest rate for both issuances was 5.15%. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of $125 million of 7.35% trust preferred capital securities on April 23, 2003 as well as lower interest rates on short term debt. Average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 1.7%, 1.2%, and 1.8% for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 34 Other Items Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (Statement No. 143), which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized by the Company at the time the obligation is incurred. The adoption of Statement No. 143 by the Company resulted in an after tax charge to earnings of $3.6 million, which is reflected as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the Companys Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Statement No. 142), the Company tested its goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2002. The Companys goodwill balance as of January 1, 2002 totaled $57.2 million and was entirely related to the NORESCO segment. The fair value of the Companys goodwill was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information. As a result of the impairment test, the Company recognized an impairment of $5.5 million, net of tax, to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value as the level of future cash flows from the NORESCO segment were expected to be less than originally anticipated. In accordance with Statement No. 142, this impairment adjustment was reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the Companys Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required. Income from Discontinued Operations In December 1998, the Company sold its natural gas midstream operations. A capital loss in connection with the sale was treated as a nondeductible item for tax reporting purposes under the then current Treasury regulations embodying the loss disallowance rule, resulting in additional tax recorded on this sale as a reduction to net income from discontinued operations. In May 2002, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued new Treasury regulations interpreting the loss disallowance rule so as to permit this capital loss to be treated as deductible. During June 2002, the Company filed amended 1998 tax return filings. Consequently, in the second quarter 2002, the Company recorded a $9.0 million increase in net income from discontinued operations related to this unexpected tax benefit. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $176.4 million in 2004 as compared to $121.0 million in 2003, a $55.4 million increase between years. The Company had increased collections from customers in 2004 as compared to 2003, driven primarily by increased net operating revenues in the Companys Supply segment. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company made cash contributions totaling $51.8 million to its pension plan, while the Company did not make any such contributions in 2004. These increases in cash flow provided by operating activities were offset by a decrease in cash from operations of $36.8 million in 2004 resulting from the Companys amendment of the prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004. Cash flows from operations were also affected by other working capital changes during 2004. When the Companys two prepaid forward gas sale transactions were originally consummated in January of 2001, the Company reviewed the specific facts and circumstances related to these transactions to determine if the appropriate Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows presentation would be as an operating activity or a financing activity. The Company concluded that the appropriate accounting presentation of the prepaid forward gas sales transactions was as an operating cash flow item. Consistent with the Companys previous presentation, the current presentation includes recognition of prepaid forward production revenues in operating activities. One of the Companys two prepaid forward gas sales contracts expired on December 31, 2003. In June 2004, the remaining prepaid forward contract was amended, which resulted in the Company repaying the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract. As stated previously, this amendment resulted in the Company repaying $36.8 million and recognizing a loss of $5.5 million on the settlement 35 of the prepaid contract. As a result of the expiration of one prepaid contract and the amendment of the other, there was $45.3 million less prepaid forward production revenue recognized in 2004 compared to the prior year. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $121.0 million in 2003 as compared to $214.5 million in 2002. The $93.5 million decrease in operating cash flows from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of the decrease in cash provided from working capital due to a large increase in inventory during 2003 as compared to a slight decrease in inventory during 2002. The increase in inventory was mainly due to increased natural gas prices and volumes stored in 2003 compared to the prior year. In addition, the Company made $51.8 million in pension contributions during 2003. Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $157.9 million in 2004 as compared to $214.3 million in 2003 and $169.2 million in 2002. The Company expended approximately $202.4 million in 2004 for capital expenditures as compared to $265.7 million in 2003 and $218.5 million in 2002. Equitable Supply spent $141.7 million in 2004, of which $91.5 million was spent on developmental drilling and $50.2 million was spent on infrastructure projects. Equitable Utilities spent $56.3 million in 2004, of which $48.5 million was spent on infrastructure projects, $3.2 million was spent on technology projects, and $4.6 million was spent on business development. Capital expenditures for Equitable Supply in 2003 included $44.2 million used for the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in ABP in February 2003. The Company also received proceeds of $42.9 million in 2004 from the sale of 800,000 shares of the Companys investment in Kerr McGee. In 2003, the sale of approximately 1.48 million shares of Westport stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 provided $38.4 million of proceeds. In addition, proceeds of $4.4 million were provided by the sale of the Companys 50% interest in an equity investment in October 2003 and proceeds of $6.6 million were provided by the sale of wells in Ohio in February 2003. Cash used in 2002 investing activities included $17.6 million invested in available for sale securities intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the Company self insures. Cash provided by investing activities in 2002 included $63.0 million of proceeds from the sale of oil dominated fields within Equitable Supply. In December 2001, the Company sold its oil dominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities. The sale resulted in a decrease of 63 Bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. These proceeds were held in a restricted cash account at December 31, 2001 for use in a potential like kind exchange for certain identified assets. During 2002, the restrictions lapsed and the cash was made available for operations. A total of $293 million was authorized for the 2005 capital budget program, as previously described in the business segment results. The Company expects to finance this program with cash generated from operations and with short term debt. See discussion in the Short term Borrowings section below regarding the financing capacity of the Company. Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $55.8 million in 2004 as compared to $112.9 million of cash flows provided by financing activities in 2003 and $57.2 million of cash flows used in financing activities in 2002. The increase in cash flows used in financing activities from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to the following items. During 2004 and 2003, the Company repurchased 2.4 million and 1.4 million shares of its outstanding common stock for $118.5 million and $55.2 million, respectively, resulting in a $63.3 million increase in cash flows used. Cash flows used in financing activities also increased due to a $29.0 million increase in 36 dividends paid in 2004 and a $75.0 million increase in long term debt during 2003 due to the issuance of $200 million of notes and the redemption of $125 million of Trust Preferred Securities. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of increased borrowing in 2003 as compared to 2002. Short term borrowing activity resulted in a net cash inflow of $93.6 million in 2003 compared to a net cash outflow of $169.4 million in the prior year. The increase in cash flows from short term borrowing activity in 2003 was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by long term debt as compared to the prior year. The Company issued $200 million of notes in February 2003 with a stated interest rate of 5.15% and a maturity date of March 2018. The proceeds from this issuance were used to retire the Companys $125 million of 7.35% Trust Preferred Securities on April 23, 2003. This provided a net cash increase from the long term debt issuance of $75 million in 2003 compared to a $200 million increase in 2002 relating to the November 2002 issuance of 5.15% notes. The $200 million long term debt issuance in November 2002 was used to repay a significant portion of commercial paper and short term loans. Other repayments and retirements of long term debt were $24.7 million in 2003 compared to $0.6 million in 2002. Additionally, loan proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the sale of contract receivables were $45.5 million in 2003 compared to $23.2 million in 2002. Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. Short term loans are used mainly to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season. The Company believes that it has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing requirements. Bank loans and commercial paper, supported by available credit, are used to meet short term financing requirements. Interest rates on these short term loans averaged 1.7% during 2004. The Company maintains, with a group of banks, a three year revolving credit agreement providing $500 million of available credit that expires in 2006. The credit agreement may be used for, among other things, credit support for the Companys commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has the authority to arrange for a commercial paper program up to $650 million. The amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004 is $295.5 million. Due to continued increases in natural gas prices during 2004 and resulting increases in the Companys net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements, the Company has borrowed additional amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its margin deposits under its exchange traded natural gas agreements. See further discussion below under Inflation and the Effect of Changing Energy Prices. In July of 2004, the Company entered into three 7.5 year secured variable share forward transactions to hedge cash flow exposure associated with the forecasted future disposal of Kerr McGee shares (see Note 3 to the Companys consolidated financial statements). Each transaction permits receipt of an amount up to the net present value of the floor price prior to maturity. The economic characteristics of any receipt would be considered that of a borrowing. The Companys credit ratings, as determined by either Standard & Poors or Moodys on its non credit enhanced, senior unsecured long term debt, determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit; the lower the Companys credit rating, the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had not borrowed any amounts against these lines of credit. Facility fees, averaging one eleventh of one percent in both 2004 and 2003, were paid to maintain credit availability. The Company believes that cash generated from operations, amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the Company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position, are more than adequate to meet the Companys reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements. 37 Financing Triggers The indentures and other agreements governing the Companys indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict the Companys ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, complete acquisitions, sell assets, and certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, in the event that the Companys debt rating changes, this event would not trigger a default under the indentures and other agreements governing the Companys indebtedness. Inflation and the Effect of Changing Energy Prices Due to the nature of the Companys operations, fluctuations in natural gas prices can significantly impact its operating cash flows, and consequently, the availability of funds for use in both investing and financing activities. As a result of the increase in natural gas prices during the past several months, the Companys liquidity position could be negatively affected by further increases. The increase in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs, as the demand for well drilling operations continues to increase; increased deferral of purchased gas costs for the Distribution operations (however, purchased gas costs are subsequently recoverable from utility customers in future months through gas cost adjustment clauses included in the Distribution operations filed rate tariffs); increased severance taxes, as the Company is subject to higher severance taxes due to increased volumes of gas extracted from the wells combined with increased value of the gas extracted from the wells; increased lease operating expenses due to increased demand for lease operating services; and increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from the Distribution operations customers. The Companys risk management program and available borrowing capacity currently in place provide means for the Company to manage these risks. Furthermore, the inventory owned by the Company as reserves or in storage increases in value, thus increasing the creditworthiness of the Company and facilitating its ability to access the credit markets for additional liquidity if needed. Due to continued increases in natural gas prices and resulting increases in the Companys net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements, the Company has borrowed additional amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its margin deposits under its exchange traded natural gas agreements. When the net fair value of any of the swap agreements represents a liability to the Company which is in excess of the agreed upon threshold between the Company and the financial institution acting as counterparty, the counterparty requires the Company to remit funds to the counterparty as a margin deposit for the derivative liability which is in excess of the threshold amount. The margin deposits are remitted back to the Company in part or in full when the excess of the derivative liability over the agreed upon threshold is reduced below the amount deposited. The Company has recorded such deposits in the amount of $36.0 million as accounts receivable in its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2004. Commodity Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Company hedges natural gas through financial instruments including forward contracts, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. The fair value of these derivative commodity instruments was a $26.8 million asset and a $350.4 million liability as of December 31, 2004, and a $34.5 million asset and a $137.6 million liability as of December 31, 2003. These amounts are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as derivative commodity instruments, at fair value. The net amount of derivative commodity instruments, at fair value, increased from a net liability of $103.1 million at December 31, 2003 to a net liability of $323.6 million at December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of the increase in natural gas prices. The absolute quantities of the Companys derivative commodity instruments that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges total 432.6 Bcf and 347.2 Bcf as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, and primarily relate to natural gas swaps. The open swaps at December 31, 2004 have maturities extending through 2011. 38 Equitable has taken advantage of favorable gas prices to significantly hedge production. As of December 31, 2004, the approximate volumes and prices of Equitables hedges and fixed price contracts for 2005 2007 are: 2005 2006 2007 Volume (Bcf) 63 62 59 Average Price (NYMEX)* $ 4.80 $ 4.73 $ 4.75 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMbtu/Mcf. With respect to hedging the Companys exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices, managements objective is to provide price protection for the majority of expected production for the years 2005 through 2008, and for over 25% of expected equity production for the years 2009 through 2011. The Companys exposure to a $0.10 change in average NYMEX natural gas price is approximately $0.01 per diluted share in 2005 and $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share for 2006 and 2007. Although the Company uses derivative instruments that create a price floor in order to provide downside protection while allowing the Company to participate in upward price movements through the use of collars and straight floors, the preponderance of instruments tend to be fixed price swaps or NYMEX traded forwards. This approach avoids the higher cost of option instruments but limits the upside potential. The current high NYMEX gas prices may cause the Company to rely less heavily on natural gas swap agreements and futures contracts. The Company also engages in basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices. Investment Securities On April 7, 2004, Westport announced a merger with Kerr McGee. On June 25, 2004, Westport and Kerr McGee announced that the two companies had completed their merger upon approval by the stockholders of each company. As a result of the transaction, the Company received 0.71 shares of Kerr McGee for each Westport share owned. Prior to the merger, the Company owned 11.53 million shares, or 17%, of Westport, resulting in the Company receiving 8.2 million shares of Kerr McGee. The Company accounted for the merger transaction in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 91 5, Nonmonetary Exchange of Cost Method Investments (EITF 91 5). EITF 91 5 states that an investor in an acquired company that accounts for the investment under the cost method shall record the transaction at fair value, resulting in a new basis and recognition of gains or losses in the income statement. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain of $217.2 million on the exchange of the Westport shares for Kerr McGee shares in the second quarter of 2004. The Company recorded its book basis in the Kerr McGee shares at $49.82 per share, which included a discount to the market price for trading restrictions on the securities. The discount was accreted into other comprehensive income during the third quarter of 2004. Subsequent to the Kerr McGee/Westport merger, the Company sold 800,000 Kerr McGee shares for $42.8 million, thus resulting in a realized gain of $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2004. Additionally, on June 30, 2004, the Company irrevocably committed to contribute 357,000 Kerr McGee shares to Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc.. This resulted in the Company recording a community giving foundation contribution expense of $18.2 million during the second quarter 2004. The shares were transferred to this foundation in the third quarter of 2004. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company entered into three variable share forward contracts to hedge cash flow exposure associated with the forecasted future disposal of Kerr McGee shares (See Note 3 to the Companys consolidated financial statements). The variable share forward contracts, which contain collars, meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue G20, Assessing and Measuring the Effectiveness of an Option used in a Cash Flow Hedge and have been designated cash flow hedges. Under this guidance, complete hedging effectiveness is assumed and the entire fair value of the collar is recorded in other comprehensive income. These variable share forward contracts provide for limited downside in the underlying Kerr McGee shares while continuing to maintain considerable exposure to potential upside in the value of Kerr McGee. The collars effectively limit the Companys cash flow exposure upon the forecasted disposal of 6.0 million Kerr McGee shares between a blended average floor price per share of $53.06 and a blended average cap price per share of $100.79. The three tranches of contracts were allocated among three different counterparties in a bidding process designed to maximize the pricing of the collars while providing an opportunity to minimize any counterparty credit exposure. A variable portion of the dividends received on the underlying Kerr McGee shares must be paid to each counterparty depending upon the hedged position of such counterparty. Based on the current hedged position of the counterparties, the 39 Company expects to pay to each counterparty approximately 67% of the next Kerr McGee dividend. In the second half of 2004, the Company recorded pre tax dividend income, net of payments to the counterparties, of $3.1 million, which is recorded in other income, net on the Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the Company owns approximately 7.0 million Kerr McGee shares, of which approximately 1.0 million shares remain unhedged. The Company is currently evaluating whether it can utilize the value of the unhedged shares effectively in a similar variable forward contract structure, or whether a sale or other course of action would constitute the best use of this asset. Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments Certain NORESCO projects are conducted through nonconsolidated entities that consist of private power generation facilities located in select international locations. During the second quarter of 2004, several negative circumstances caused the Company to reassess its international investments for additional impairments and to accelerate its plans to exit the international generation business. Changes in pricing in the electricity power market in Panama during the second quarter of 2004 negatively impacted the outlook for operations of IGC/ERI Pan Am Thermal Generating Limited (Pan Am), a Panamanian electric generation project. As a result, the Company performed an impairment analysis of its equity interest in this project. This involved preparing a probability weighted cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and comparing this amount to the book value of the equity investment. The probability weighted cash flows resulted in a lower fair value than the carrying value, and an impairment was deemed necessary. An impairment of $22.1 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2004 and represents the full value of NORESCOs equity investment in the project. During 2004, the Company also reviewed its investment in Compania Hidroelectrica Dona Julia, S.D.R. Ltd. (Dona Julia), a Costa Rican electric generation project, as the investment was being actively marketed for sale. Based on the analysis performed on the sales value of the investment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2004 to write down the investment to its fair value less costs to sell. Following the impairment, the investment in Dona Julia was considered held for sale. The investment was included in equity in nonconsolidated investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2004. In January 2005, the Company sold its interest in Dona Julia to a third party purchaser and recorded a slight gain on the sale in 2005. Additional impairment charges of $15.3 million were also recorded in the second quarter of 2004 for total impairment charges of $40.2 million. The additional charges related to various costs and obligations related to exiting NORESCOs investments in international power plant projects. Included in these charges was a liability for loan guarantees in the amount of $5.8 million in support of the 50% owned non recourse financed energy project known as Pan Am (described above). The impairment charges were reviewed in the fourth quarter of 2004 and reduced by $0.6 million. The entire impairment charge has been included in international investments, primarily impairment on the Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company is actively evaluating alternatives for the sale and disposal of its international assets. The Company reviewed its equity investment related to Petroelectrica de Panama LDC, an independent power plant in Panama, during the fourth quarter of 2003. As a result of the analysis performed, an impairment of $11.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 was recorded which represented the full value of NORESCOs equity investment in the project. The plant has been dismantled and the proceeds from the sale of the plants engines will be used to cover the costs of remediation and final closure in 2005. In June 2003, the Company reevaluated its interest in Hunterdon Cogeneration LP (Hunterdon) and concluded that the Company effectively controlled Hunterdon for consolidation purposes. As a result, the Company began consolidating Hunterdons financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of June 30, 2003 in the NORESCO segment. In 2000, Equitable Supply sold an interest in oil and gas properties to a trust, Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT). The Company retained a 1% interest in profits of ANGT and has separately negotiated arms length, market based rates with ANGT for gathering, marketing, and operating fees to deliver its natural gas to market. At December 31, 2004, the Company has a receivable recorded from ANGT totaling $1.4 million. This receivable resulted from inadvertent overpayments to ANGT for more than the amount due under the Net Profits Interest 40 Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will deduct the overpayment from future payments to ANGT over an extended period of time. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN No. 46). FIN No. 46 required certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity did not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or did not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Prior to FIN No. 46, an entity was generally consolidated by an enterprise when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. FIN No. 46 was effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. The Company adopted FIN No. 46 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003 as of July 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN No. 46 required the consolidation of Plymouth Cogeneration Limited Partnership (Plymouth), a joint venture entered into by NORESCO, and the deconsolidation of EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP (Jamaica), which is the partnership that holds the Jamaican power plant. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN No. 46 (FIN No. 46R) that modified some of the provisions of FIN No. 46 and provided exemptions to certain entities from the original guidance. The Company adopted FIN No. 46R in the first quarter of 2004. The adoption of FIN No. 46R required the Company to deconsolidate Plymouth as of January 1, 2004, due to certain modifications of the original FIN No. 46 provisions. This deconsolidation returned Plymouth to the equity method of accounting for investments. The Company restored the equity investment in Plymouth of $0.1 million and decreased minority interest by $0.6 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of January 1, 2004, $4.9 million of assets and $4.9 million of liabilities, including nonrecourse debt of $4.0 million, were removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also has a non equity interest in a variable interest entity, Appalachian NPI, LLC (ANPI), in which Equitable was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2004, ANPI had $255.5 million of total assets and $312.6 million of total liabilities (including $172.9 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. The Companys maximum exposure to a loss as a result of its involvement with ANPI is estimated to be approximately $29 million. On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (Statement No. 123R). This guidance replaced previously existing requirements under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (Statement No. 123), and APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). Statement No. 123R eliminates the ability for an entity to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method of APB No. 25. Under Statement No. 123R, an entity must recognize the compensation cost related to employee services received in exchange for all forms of share based payments to employees, including employee stock options, as an expense in its income statement. The compensation cost of the award would generally be measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Statement No. 123R will be effective for public entities in the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. While the impact of adoption of Statement No. 123R cannot be determined at this time, the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Had the Company adopted Statement No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. On June 17, 2004, the FASB issued an exposure draft, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. The proposed interpretation would clarify that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity that is conditional on a future event is within the scope of FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. A recording of the liability at fair value would be recognized for a conditional asset retirement obligation when the liability is incurred. Certain factors regarding the timing and method of the settlement, which are conditional upon the future events occurring, would be factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the recognition of the liability. The final rules are expected to be 41 issued in early 2005 and are anticipated to be effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. The Company will evaluate the impact of any change in accounting standard on the Companys financial position and results of operations when the final rules are issued. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company issued a liquidity reserve guarantee to ANPI, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations, and is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by ANGT. The Company received a market based fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2004, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be $29 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN No. 45), and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. The Company has certain minority investments representing ownership interests in transactions by which natural gas producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin region of the United States were sold. The Company has entered into agreements with these entities to provide gathering and operating services to deliver their gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The total revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue from these fees will be affected by the purchase of the 99% limited partnership interest in ESP, which occurred in January 2005 and is more fully discussed under the section Equitable Supply. In order to accelerate cash collections, the NORESCO segment executes transactions to sell certain contract receivables to a financial institution and a variable interest entity. The variable interest entity is a multi seller conduit that purchases contract receivables from several energy companies. The Company has no ownership interest in or control of the variable interest entity. As further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company does not retain any interest in the contract receivables once the sale is complete. For the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately $53.8 million of the contract receivables met the criteria for sales treatment. Pension Plans The Company made cash contributions totaling $49.6 million to its pension plan during the first three quarters of 2003. In accordance with current funding guidelines, these contributions were designated as 2002 plan year contributions and, in the aggregate, represent the maximum allowable contribution that the Company could make to its pension plan for that plan year. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company made an additional cash contribution totaling $2.2 million to its pension plan. In accordance with current funding guidelines, this contribution was designated as a 2003 plan year contribution. As a result of the cash contributions, the Companys minimum funding requirement was zero for the 2004 plan year. The Company was not required to, and consequently did not make any contribution to its pension plans during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2002. The Company expects to make a cash contribution of $10.3 million to its pension plan during 2005 to fully fund the cash balance participants portion of the pension plan which was settled effective December 31, 2004. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service and the final settlement of the cash balance portion of the pension plan in 2005, are expected to be paid during each of the next five years and the five years thereafter: $28.2 million in 2005; $8.2 million in 2006; $8.1 million in 2007; $7.7 million in 2008; $8.3 million in 2009; and $37.5 million in the five years thereafter. The reduction in the fair market value of the Companys pension plan assets over the period of 2000 to 2002, coupled with decreases in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and increases in the amount of unrecognized actuarial losses, has also contributed to increases in the amount of pension expense recognized by the Company. Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2004, 2003, and 2002, excluding special termination benefits, one time settlement expenses and curtailment losses, totaled $0.8 million, $5.1 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company froze the pension benefit provided through a 42 defined benefit plan to approximately 340 non represented employees. The Company now provides benefits to these employees under a defined contribution plan that covers all other non represented employees of the Company. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company irrevocably committed to settle the pension obligation of those non represented employees whose benefits were frozen in 2003. As a result of this settlement, which was accounted for under SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, the Company recognized a one time settlement expense of $13.4 million as of December 31, 2004. The settlement expense that was recognized for these non represented employees was primarily the result of accelerated recognition of approximately $11.0 million in previously deferred unrecognized losses. The accelerated recognition of the previously deferred unrecognized losses, along with a reduced number of retirees obtaining benefits in the future, will decrease the expected amount of pension expense to be recognized by the Company in future years. As a result of this settlement, the projected benefit obligation of the pension plan is expected to be reduced by approximately $19.6 million. Additionally, the pension settlement expense is an unallocated expense in deriving total operating income for segment reporting purposes. See Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the projected future pension expense is expected to decrease as a result of the settlement of the cash balance portion of the pension plan. Incentive Compensation The Company continues to shift its compensation focus from stock options to performance based stock units and time restricted stock awards. Management and the Board of Directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach more closely aligns managements incentives with shareholder rewards than is the case with traditional stock options. The Company has long utilized time restricted stock in its compensation plans, but only began issuing performance restricted units in 2002 and has now fully transitioned to a long term incentive approach that is limited to performance restricted stock or units and time restricted stock. No stock options were awarded in 2004. The Company recorded the following incentive compensation expense for the periods indicated below: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Millions) Short term incentive compensation expense $ 15.8 $ 10.5 $ 12.1 Long term incentive compensation expense 30.0 17.6 9.1 Total incentive compensation expense $ 45.8 $ 28.1 $ 21.2 Much of the $17.7 million increase from 2003 to 2004 was due, directly and indirectly, to the culmination of the Kerr McGee/Westport merger. The long term incentive compensation expenses are primarily associated with executive performance incentive programs that were instituted starting in 2002. The Company currently estimates 2005 total incentive compensation expense of approximately $34 million. On February 23, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2005 Program) under the 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Program was established to provide additional incentive benefits to retain executive officers and certain other employees of the Company to further align the interests of the persons primarily responsible for the success of the Company with the interests of the shareholders. Under the program a maximum of 600,000 stock units may be granted among a maximum of forty participants. The vesting of these stock units will occur on December 31, 2008, contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to 29 peer companies and the Companys average absolute return on total capital during the four year performance period. As a result, zero to 1,500,000 units (250% of the units available for grant) may be distributed in cash or stock. The 29 peer companies are identical to the peer group identified for the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements except for the exclusion of NUI Corp. The 2005 program will be accounted for as a variable plan and expensed over the four year performance period based on anticipated stock price and expected level of performance. Federal Legislation As a result of the Companys increased partnership interest in ABP in 2002, the Company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to ABP. This resulted in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate during 2002. The nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002, and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future. On November 18, 2003, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 (H.R. 6) was passed by the House of Representatives. This comprehensive energy policy legislation, as reported by conferees from the House of Representatives and the Senate, included an extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit for existing qualifying wells and for newly drilled qualifying wells. The Senate was unable to pass H.R. 6 before adjourning for 2003 due to a lack of votes needed to avoid a threatened filibuster. Energy tax legislation continues to be discussed by the Senate and House of Representatives from time to time, but any extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit continues to remain uncertain. On September 30, 2003, the enabling legislation for the performance contracting work that NORESCO performs for the federal government under the Department of Energy contracts lapsed. On October 28, 2004, the 43 President signed legislation extending the contracting period for performance contracting at federal government facilities through October 2006. During October 2004, Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act), which the President signed into law on October 22, 2004. The Jobs Creation Act is the first major corporate tax act in a number of years. Some of the key provisions of the Jobs Creation Act include a new domestic manufacturing deduction, a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings, oil and gas producer incentives (not an extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit), new tax shelter penalties, restrictions on deferred compensation and numerous other issue specific provisions aimed at specific transactions. The only item in this legislation impacting the Companys consolidated financial statements during 2004 was the temporary incentive to repatriate foreign earnings (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Rate Regulation The Companys Distribution operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the PA PUC and the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, and to rate regulation by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The Companys interstate pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the FERC. Accounting for the Companys regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. Schedule of Contractual Obligations The following table details the future projected payments associated with the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010+ (Thousands) Interest expense $ 507,676 $ 38,219 $ 74,981 $ 73,526 $ 320,950 Long term debt 628,351 10,582 14,335 4,300 599,134 Operating leases 66,939 6,663 13,525 9,198 37,553 Purchase obligations 174,060 29,896 52,659 37,757 53,748 Other long term liabilities 42,870 42,870 Total contractual obligations $ 1,419,896 $ 85,360 $ 198,370 $ 124,781 $ 1,011,385 Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as a limited amount of equipment. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company entered into a long term lease with Continental Real Estate Companies (Continental) to occupy office space in a building at the North Shore in Pittsburgh. This action will help consolidate the Companys administrative operations. Continental is constructing and will own the office building, which is expected to be completed in 2005. The term of the lease is 20 years and nine months and the base rent is approximately $2 million per year. Relocation of operations from locations that utilize space under long term leases will likely cause additional expense in 2005. The base rent payments of approximately $2 million per year have been included in the table above with payments commencing in 2006. Included within the purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately $29.7 million relating to the Companys natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing long term contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to eleven years at December 31, 2004. Approximately $20.3 million of these costs are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. The other long term liabilities line represents the total estimated payout for the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program payable in the first quarter of 2006. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of payout under this program. 44 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the ordinary course of business, various legal claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company has established reserves for pending litigation, which it believes are adequate, and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. After an extended period of troubled operations, ERI JAM, LLC, a subsidiary that holds the Companys interest in EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP, an international infrastructure project located in Jamaica, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court (Delaware) in April 2003. In the third quarter 2003, ERI JAM, LLC transferred control of the international infrastructure project under the partnership agreement to the other non affiliate general partner. The international infrastructure project was deconsolidated in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. In September 2003, project level counterparties, Jamaica Broilers Group Limited (JBG) and Energy Associated Limited (EAL), filed a claim against ERI JAM LLC as Debtor in Possession in the Chapter 11 case. EAL, an affiliate of JBG, is a limited partner in EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP. In October 2003, JBG and EAL also filed a multi count complaint seeking damages against Equitable and certain of its affiliates in U.S. District Court (Western District of Pennsylvania) alleging breach of contract, tortious interference with contractual relations, negligence and a variety of related claims with respect to the operation and management of EAL/ERI Cogeneration Partners LP. Equitable filed a Motion to Dismiss in September 2004, and subsequently agreed in principle with JBG and EAL to settle the litigation. The parties are currently negotiating the terms of a settlement agreement. The various regulatory authorities that oversee Equitables operations will, from time to time, make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the Company. It is the Companys policy to comply with applicable laws and cooperate when regulatory bodies make requests. The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental and environmentally related laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which are constantly changing, can require expenditures for remediation and may in certain instances result in assessment of fines. The Company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures. The estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued. However, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets when recoverable through regulated rates. Ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements, have not been material. Management believes that any such required expenditures will not be significantly different in either their nature or amount in the future and does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company has identified situations that require remedial action for which approximately $2.8 million is included in other long term liabilities at December 31, 2004. At the end of the useful life of a well the Company is required to remediate the site by plugging and abandoning the well. Costs associated with this obligation totaled $0.7 million, $1.3 million, and $0.7 million during the years ended 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. In the second quarter of 2004, the Company established a liability for a guarantee in the amount of $5.8 million in support of a 50% owned non recourse financed energy project in Panama. The guarantee covers a project loan debt service reserve requirement. The guarantee was included as part of the entire impairment charge of $39.6 million, which has been included as international investments, primarily impairment, on the Statements of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2004. Audit Committee The Audit Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, meets periodically with Equitables independent auditors and management to review the Companys financial statements and the results of audit activities. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to the Board of Directors on the results of its review and selects the independent auditors. 45 Transactions with Directors Affiliated Companies In the course of ordinary business, the Company may have engaged in transactions with companies and organizations for which an Equitable Resources director serves as an officer. Those directors did not have a material interest in any such transactions and none of those transactions exceeded 5% of the gross revenues of either Equitable Resources or the other organization. Moreover, any such transactions were entered into on arms length terms believed to be fair. Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon Equitables consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Asset Impairment: The Company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable. The Company applies SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (Statement No. 144), in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. This Statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying value, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, because it requires management to make assumptions about cash flows over future years. These assumptions affect the amount of an impairment, which would have an impact on the income statement. Managements assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company holds several investments in nonconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method. Accounting Principles Board No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18), requires a company to recognize a loss in the value of an equity method investment which is other than a temporary decline. The Company analyzes its equity method investments based on its share of estimated future cash flows from the investment to determine whether the carrying amount will be recoverable. This is a critical accounting estimate for reasons similar to those described above regarding assumptions about future cash flows. During the second quarter of 2004, several negative circumstances caused the Company to evaluate its international investments for additional impairments and to accelerate its plans to exit the international generation business. See Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment analysis performed in the second quarter of 2004. Goodwill: Beginning in fiscal year 2002, goodwill was required to be evaluated annually for impairment, in accordance with Statement No. 142. This Statement requires that a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired. Step one is to test for potential impairment, which requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value. If the fair value is higher than the book value, no impairment occurs. If the fair value is lower than the book value, step two must be performed. Step two requires measurement of the amount of impairment loss, if any, and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. The resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment must be recorded. 46 The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and these changes could cause a material impact to the income statement. Managements assumptions about discount rates, inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions, such as expected growth rate, require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and anticipated future revenues. Additionally, Statement No. 142 requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated. As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill recorded was analyzed for impairment with the implementation of Statement No. 142. In 2002, the fair value of the Companys goodwill (all of which related to NORESCO) was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information. Based on the analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value recorded for the goodwill. Therefore, the Company recognized an impairment. During the first quarter of 2002, the implied fair value of the goodwill, using the discounted cash flows methodology, was $51.7 million. The carrying value of the goodwill was $57.2 million, resulting in an after tax impairment charge of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarters of 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Companys Utility division, Equitable Gas Company, encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable. As such, Equitable Gas Company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision, Equitable Gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable write offs as a percentage of total revenue. This historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis. For 2004, the monthly provision was established at 4% of residential sales. Periodically, the reserve is reviewed for reasonableness. The historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather. Both of these items ultimately impact the customers ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the pass through of purchased gas costs to the customers. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the changes in the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital. The actual weather, commodity prices, and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from managements assumptions and may impact expected operating income. The regulatory environment allows certain customers to enter into long term payment arrangements, the ultimate collectibility of which is difficult to determine. Additionally, management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. Performance Plan: The Company accounts for stock based compensation awards under APB No. 25. The Company treats its 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2003 Plan) under which grants were awarded in 2003 as a variable plan. The actual cost to be recorded for the plan is not known until the measurement date, which is in December 2005 for the 2003 Plan, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized. The number of shares to be awarded in the plan is dependent upon attainment of certain total shareholder return performance goals relative to the performance of a peer group. In the current period, the Company estimated that the performance measures would be met at 167% of the full value of the shares for the 2003 Plan and that the estimated end of 2005 share price would be $62.50. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the performance plan is a critical accounting estimate because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the shares and the performance of the peer group. Additionally, the impact on the Statement of Consolidated Income of these changes could be material. Managements assumptions about future stock price and the amount of the payment to ultimately be made requires significant judgment due to the volatility of the stock market. Pension Plans: The calculation of the Companys net periodic benefit cost (pension expense) and benefit obligation (pension liability) associated with its defined benefit pension plan (pension plan) requires the use of a number of assumptions that the Company deems to be critical accounting estimates. Changes in these 47 assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from these assumptions. The Company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. The expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. The Company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the Company at that time, including the pension plans investment mix and the historical and forecasted rates of return on these types of securities. The pension plans investment mix as of January 1, 2004 and 2005 approximated 60% equity securities and 40% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (Statement No. 87). Although the long term rate is intended to be fairly consistent, the Company has reevaluated and reduced the rate at the beginning of both 2003 and 2004. The expected long term rate of return determined by the Company was 8.25% at both January 1, 2004 and 2005. Pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases. Lowering the expected long term rate of return by 0.5% (from 8.25% to 7.75%) as of January 1, 2005 would increase the Companys projected net periodic pension expense by approximately $0.6 million. The assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled. In estimating that rate, Statement No. 87 requires, and the Company looks to, rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. The Company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of 6.00% and 6.25% as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.00% to 5.50%) would increase the Companys projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 by approximately $4.3 million. Additionally, had the Companys discount rate decreased to 5.50% as of December 31, 2004, the Companys net periodic pension expense for 2005 would be projected to increase by approximately $0.2 million, as a significant portion of the pension plans participants are retirees. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (Statement No. 109). Statement No. 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Please read Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements requires the Company to estimate the income tax expense in each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities and reserves together with assessing the tax effect of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as intangible drilling costs, other comprehensive income and depreciation of other fixed assets, for tax and accounting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Evidence used includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the statements of consolidated income. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from alternative minimum tax credits, deferred revenues and expenses, and state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has established a 48 valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. No other valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. 49 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas, which can affect the operating results of Equitable through the Equitable Supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the Equitable Utilities segment. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company uses simple, nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit the exposure to shifts in market prices. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. For commodity price derivatives used to hedge forecasted Company production, Equitable sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels, which are exposed to price risk. These financial instruments include forward contracts, swap agreements (which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity), options and other contractual agreements. The level of price exposure is limited by the value at risk limits allowed by this policy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. In general, Equitables strategy is to become more highly hedged for production over the next several years at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels. The Company believes that prices between $3.00 and $3.50 per Mcf are sustainable in the long term. Above this range, non traditional supplies become economically feasible. Furthermore, the Company expects price volatility to result in prices significantly higher and lower than this range. The Company attempts to take advantage of these price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when prices are much higher than the range and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below the range. However, the Company has typically not hedged material volumes unless the natural gas prices exceed $4.00 per Mcf. The goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility. For commodity price derivatives held for trading purposes, the marketing group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits. These financial instruments include forward contracts, swap agreements, which may require payments to (or receipt of payments from) counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity, options and other contractual agreements. With respect to the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2004, the Company continued to execute its hedging strategy by utilizing price swaps of approximately 314.9 Bcf of natural gas. These derivatives have hedged varying levels of expected equity production through 2011. A decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2004 levels would increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately $185.8 million. An increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas would decrease the fair market value by the same amount. With respect to derivative contracts held by the Company for trading purposes as of December 31, 2004, a decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2004 level would decrease the fair market value by approximately $0.1 million. An increase of 10% in market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2004 level would increase the fair market value the same amount. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the natural gas instruments using a method similar to its normal change in fair value as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at December 31, 2004. The price change was then applied to the natural gas instruments recorded on the Companys balance sheet, resulting in the change in fair value. The above analysis of the energy derivatives held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with 50 commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk, and as applicable, anticipated transactions occur as expected. The disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. If the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the energy derivatives, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company entered into three variable share forward contracts to hedge cash flow exposure associated with the forecasted future disposal of Kerr McGee shares. The variable share forward contracts, which contain collars, meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue G20, Assessing and Measuring the Effectiveness of an Option used in a Cash Flow Hedge and have been designated as cash flow hedges. Under this guidance, complete hedging effectiveness is assumed and the entire fair value of the collar is recorded in other comprehensive income. These variable share forward contracts provide tax efficient monetization alternatives for the now limited downside in the underlying Kerr McGee shares while continuing to maintain considerable exposure to potential upside in the value of Kerr McGee. The three tranches of contracts represent the hedging of 6.0 million of the Kerr McGee shares received as merger consideration and were allocated among three different counterparties in a bidding process designed to maximize the pricing of the collars while providing an opportunity to minimize any counterparty credit exposure. The remaining unhedged Kerr McGee shares owned by the Company and not committed to the foundation after entering into these contracts is approximately 1.0 million shares. The Company is currently evaluating whether it can utilize the value of the unhedged shares effectively in a similar variable forward contract structure, or whether a sale or other course of action would constitute the best use of this asset. The Company has variable rate short term debt. As such, there is some limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the Company under its current capital structure. The Company maintains fixed rate long term debt that is not subject to fluctuating interest rates. The Company may enter into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to future changes in interest rates, but as of December 31, 2004 the Company had no such instruments outstanding. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value. NYMEX traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties. The Company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the Companys criteria for credit and liquidity strength.

See Inflation and the Effect of Changing Energy Prices in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion regarding the effect of fluctuations in natural gas prices on the Companys operations. 51
