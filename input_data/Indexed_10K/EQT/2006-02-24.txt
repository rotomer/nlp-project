Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Equitables consolidated income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2005 was $258.6 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared with $298.8 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, for 2004, and $165.8 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, for 2003. The $40.2 million decrease in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change from 2004 to 2005 was primarily the result of several non operational factors. The Company recorded a gain in 2004 as a result of the Westport Resources Corporation (Westport)/Kerr McGee Corporation (Kerr McGee) merger in the second quarter of 2004 as well as a gain on the sale of 0.8 million Kerr McGee shares subsequent to the merger. These gains were partially offset by an expense related to the Companys charitable contribution of 0.4 million Kerr McGee shares to the Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc., a community giving foundation, in 2004. Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2005 included a significant gain from the sale of all of the Companys remaining Kerr McGee shares, which partially offset the impact of the 2004 items. The net impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change of these four items was a $91.7 million decrease from 2004 to 2005. Operating income increased $54.1 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher realized selling prices, an increase in sales volumes from production and increased revenues from storage asset optimization opportunities. These increases were offset in some part by increased operating costs resulting primarily from higher natural gas prices and sales volumes, increased incentive expenses and impairment charges related to the Companys office consolidation. The Companys effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, was 37.2% compared to 34.2% for both the year ended December 31, 2004, and the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily the result of tax benefit disallowances under Section 162(m) of the IRC. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2004 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased from 2003 primarily due to the gain related to the Westport/Kerr McGee merger. Higher realized selling prices, an increase in sales volumes from production and the proceeds received from an insurance settlement also helped to improve 2004 earnings. The improved 2004 earnings were partially offset by an increase in incentive expenses, the costs to settle the cash balance portion of a defined benefit pension plan in 2004, decreased gains from the sale of available for sale securities in 2004 as compared to 2003, an increase over the prior year in charitable foundation contribution expense, the loss on a 2004 amendment of the Companys prepaid forward contract and warmer weather in 2004. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, minority interest and other income, net. Interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive costs, pension costs and administrative costs totaling $48.0 million, $45.8 million and $20.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were not allocated to business segments. The increase in unallocated expenses from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to increased long term incentive expenses. The Company has reconciled each segments operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, excluding Westport, minority interest and other income, net to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, excluding Westport, minority interest and other income, net totals in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments 19 operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. Equitables management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitables segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. Equitable Utilities Overview Equitable Gas continues to work with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performance based rate making. Performance based incentives provide an opportunity for Equitable Gas to make short term releases of unutilized pipeline capacity, or capacity releases, for a fee or to participate in the bundling of gas supply and pipeline capacity for off system sales. An off system sale involves the purchase and delivery of gas to a customer at mutually agreed upon points on facilities not owned by the Company. Equitable Gas performance based purchased gas cost credit incentive and a second PA PUC approved performance based initiative related to balancing services were available through September 2005. Effective September 30, 2005, an Opinion and Order issued by the PA PUC modified the performance based purchased gas cost credit design on a prospective basis, providing Equitable Gas with a 25% sharing level of capacity releases and off system sales, and terminating the Companys balancing service performance based incentive. Equitable Gas has filed a petition for reconsideration and clarification with the PA PUC and is awaiting a final Order. The gas cost rates effective for Equitable Gass residential and commercial customers beginning October 1, 2005, include then current high natural gas commodity prices, resulting in residential rates as much as 40% higher than those in place in 2004. These increases can present a significant challenge to the Companys low income customers, especially during the winter months. The Company is working with federal and state government officials, industry associations and local foundations to identify sources of funds to assist low income customers in paying their heating bills. In December 2005, Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. made a grant of $1 million to the local Dollar Energy Fund, a non profit organization which assists low income consumers in paying their heating bills. In addition, the Company announced the creation of a new $1 million HELP Grant program, which it manages internally, to provide additional assistance to low income consumers for the December 2005 through March 2006 winter heating season. Approximately $0.3 million of this amount was credited to eligible customers accounts during December 2005. In December 2005, the PA PUC approved Equitable Gass petition requesting approval to use up to $7 million of pipeline supplier refunds to benefit low income customers in its service territory. Under programs designed and managed by Equitable Gas, the funds are being used to assist low income customers in re establishing and maintaining their service during the 2005 2006 winter heating season. Additionally, Pennsylvania Governor Rendell proposed and the state legislature approved $19 million in state funding for Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) grants to be administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare. The Company will closely monitor its collections rates and adjust its reserve for uncollectible accounts as necessary. The Responsible Utility Customer Protection Act, which became effective on December 14, 2004, established new procedures for Pennsylvania utilities regarding collection activities with respect to deposits, payment plans and terminations for residential customers and is intended to help utility companies collect amounts due from customers. As a result, beginning in 2005, the Company was permitted to begin sending winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250% of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the PA PUC. In 2005, the Company sent termination notices to a number of eligible customers and will continue to utilize this mechanism in order to reduce delinquent accounts receivable from customers who have the ability to pay. 20 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % 2003 % OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,829) 5,543 5,360 3.4 5,695 (5.9 ) Residential sales and transportation volume (MMcf) 24,680 25,520 (3.3 ) 27,262 (6.4 ) Commercial and industrial volume (MMcf) 25,368 29,597 (14.3 ) 28,784 2.8 Total throughput (MMcf) Distribution Operations 50,048 55,117 (9.2 ) 56,046 (1.7 ) Net operating revenues (thousands): Distribution Operations (regulated): Residential $ 102,457 $ 104,612 (2.1 ) $ 109,821 (4.7 ) Commercial & industrial 46,857 48,563 (3.5 ) 50,660 (4.1 ) Other 7,544 5,950 26.8 4,705 26.5 Total Distribution Operations 156,858 159,125 (1.4 ) 165,186 (3.7 ) Pipeline Operations (regulated) 53,767 55,123 (2.5 ) 52,926 4.2 Energy Marketing 42,739 28,457 50.2 27,011 5.4 Total net operating revenues $ 253,364 $ 242,705 4.4 $ 245,123 (1.0 ) Total operating expenses as a % of net operating revenues 61.22 % 55.44 % 55.17 % Operating income (thousands): Distribution Operations (regulated) $ 40,322 $ 56,877 (29.1 ) $ 63,093 (9.9 ) Pipeline Operations (regulated) 17,345 24,656 (29.7 ) 22,415 10.0 Energy Marketing 40,587 26,616 52.5 24,371 9.2 Total operating income $ 98,254 $ 108,149 (9.1 ) $ 109,879 (1.6 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (thousands): Distribution Operations $ 19,483 $ 17,474 11.5 $ 20,025 (12.7 ) Pipeline Operations 8,317 7,985 4.2 7,274 9.8 Energy Marketing 74 170 (56.5 ) 284 (40.1 ) Total DD&A $ 27,874 $ 25,629 8.8 $ 27,583 (7.1 ) Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 61,349 $ 56,274 9.0 $ 60,414 (6.9 ) 21 Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % 2003 % FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Distribution revenues (regulated) $ 469,102 $ 422,438 11.0 $ 396,203 6.6 Pipeline revenues (regulated) 57,534 55,123 4.4 52,926 4.2 Marketing revenues 382,479 300,513 27.3 205,258 46.4 Less: intrasegment revenues (45,804 ) (46,213 ) (0.9 ) (41,019 ) 12.7 Total operating revenues 863,311 731,861 18.0 613,368 19.3 Purchased gas costs 609,947 489,156 24.7 368,245 32.8 Net operating revenues 253,364 242,705 4.4 245,123 (1.0 ) Operating expenses: Operating and maintenance (O & M) 57,315 52,481 9.2 51,208 2.5 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 66,080 56,446 17.1 56,453 Impairment charges 3,841 100.0 DD&A 27,874 25,629 8.8 27,583 (7.1 ) Total operating expenses 155,110 134,556 15.3 135,244 (0.5 ) Operating income $ 98,254 $ 108,149 (9.1 ) $ 109,879 (1.6 ) Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. December 31, 2004 Equitable Utilities operating income totaled $98.3 million for 2005 compared to $108.1 million for 2004. Net operating income for 2005 included $16.0 million in charges for the termination and settlement of defined benefit pension plans and a $3.8 million impairment charge in connection with the Companys office consolidation. Net operating revenues were $253.4 million for 2005 compared to $242.7 million for 2004. The $10.7 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased marketing net operating revenues of $14.2 million, resulting primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in a high and increasingly volatile natural gas commodity price environment. Distribution Operations net operating revenues decreased $2.2 million due to decreased volumes. Distribution Operations residential sales and transportation volumes decreased 840 MMcf from 2004 to 2005 due to decreased base load and lower customer use per degree day. These reductions resulted from increased customer conservation, more timely termination of non paying customers in 2005 and other factors. Increased volumes as a result of colder weather partially offset these decreases in residential volumes, as heating degree days were 5,543 in 2005, which was 3% colder than the 5,360 heating degree days in 2004 although still warmer than normal. Distribution Operations commercial and industrial volumes decreased 4,229 MMcf from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a reduction in industrial throughput to two major steel making customers. These high volume industrial sales have very low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. Pipeline Operations net operating revenues decreased $1.3 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a $3.8 million loss on fuel and retention in excess of the current rates. This loss was partially offset by increased revenues earned in loaning and parking services. These services are contracted on an as available basis, as opposed to long term firm storage contracts. This flexibility allows customers, including the Companys marketing affiliate, to take advantage of the pipelines available storage to secure future supply at favorable prices. These services were heavily subscribed in 2005, as higher volatility in natural gas prices provided substantial value for storage options. Operating expenses totaled $155.1 million for 2005 compared to $134.6 million for 2004. Operating expenses for 2005 included $16.0 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a $3.8 million loss related to the impairment of certain leased offices, furniture and equipment in connection with the Companys relocation into its new, consolidated office space. Excluding these 22 items, operating expenses increased $0.7 million, which resulted from increases of $2.3 million in depreciation expense, $2.2 million in incentive compensation, $1.4 million in customer operations expenses and $1.1 million in employee benefit costs, largely offset by decreases of $4.7 million in bad debt expense and $1.4 million in insurance costs. The increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in Equitable Utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software, distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices. The improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of non paying customers, a full year impact of a $0.30 per Mcf regulatory surcharge instituted in April 2004, improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process. These improvements were offset somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2005 by high commodity rates and cold weather, which resulted in increased provisions for bad debt in that period compared to the prior year. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs. December 31, 2003 Equitable Utilities operating income totaled $108.1 million for 2004 compared to $109.9 million for 2003. The $1.8 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in net operating revenues resulting from warmer weather in 2004. Net operating revenues were $242.7 million for 2004 compared to $245.1 million for 2003. The $2.4 million decrease in net operating revenues was primarily due to warmer weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2004. Heating degree days were 5,360 in 2004, which was 6% warmer than the 5,695 heating degree days in 2003. Additionally in February 2004, a rate moratorium for West Virginia customers expired. As a result, the Distribution Operations subsequently returned to normal gas recovery rates, which led to a decrease in net operating revenues of $0.9 million for the full year 2004. Such decreases for the Distribution Operations were partially offset by increased gathering revenue at the Distribution and Pipeline operations and higher storage related margins at the Pipeline Operations. Distributions Operations residential sales and transportation volumes decreased 1,742 MMcf from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the warmer weather. Distributions Operations commercial and industrial volumes increased 813 MMcf from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in sales to steel industry customers, partially offset by reductions in volumes sold to institutional and manufacturing customers and the effects of warmer weather. The increased high volume steel industry sales have low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. Operating expenses totaled $134.6 million for 2004 compared to $135.2 million for 2003. This $0.6 million decrease was the result of several factors. DD&A decreased $2.0 million primarily due to a $3.5 million adjustment related to increases in the estimated useful life for Equitable Gas main lines and services lines resulting from a PA PUC mandated asset service life study. This decrease was partially offset by increases in DD&A related mainly to increased capital in 2004, of which approximately $0.5 million was related to the implementation of a customer information system. SG&A was relatively consistent between years, with several offsetting fluctuations. Bad debt expense decreased by $1.7 million from 2003 to 2004 due to a reduction of a regulatory asset reserve of $7.5 million in 2004, partially offset by an increase of $5.8 million mainly related to delays in initiating collection activity due to the implementation of a customer information system in 2004 as well as increased gas rates in that year. The reduction in the regulatory asset reserve was due to Equitable Gas having higher than anticipated recoveries for the Delinquency Reduction Opportunity Program through payment and rates. Offsetting this and other reductions in SG&A, the Distribution Operations experienced increased insurance and legal costs of $1.7 million, a $0.9 million increase in Pennsylvania franchise tax, $0.7 million of expense incurred primarily related to increased overtime and contractor costs as a result of the flooding which occurred in September 2004 due to Hurricane Ivan and other slight increases in administrative expense accruals. O & M costs increased primarily as a result of $1.1 million related to the implementation of the customer information system. See Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of Equitable Utilities capital expenditures during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Outlook Equitable Utilities business strategy is focused on effectively managing its gas distribution assets, optimizing its return on assets, selectively growing its gas distribution business through acquisition and developing a portfolio 23 of closely related, unregulated businesses with an emphasis on risk management and earnings viability. Key elements of Equitable Utilities strategy include: Enhancing the value and growth potential of the regulated utility operations. Equitable Utilities will seek to enhance the value and growth of its existing utility assets by managing its capital spending effectively; establishing a reputation for excellent customer service; continuing to leverage technology; working to achieve authorized returns in each jurisdiction and, in those jurisdictions where it has performance based rates, sharing the benefits with its customers; and maintaining earnings and rate stability through regulatory arrangements that fairly balance the interests of customers and shareholders. Selectively evaluating acquisitions. The Company will selectively examine and evaluate the acquisition of natural gas distribution, gas pipeline or other gas related assets. The Companys acquisition criteria include the ability to generate operational synergies, strategic fit relative to the Companys core competencies, value from near term earnings contributions and adequate returns on invested capital. Selectively expanding Equitable Utilities natural gas storage and gathering operations. The Company intends to continue to expand its natural gas storage and gathering businesses to provide disciplined incremental earnings growth for shareholders. In its asset management business, Equitable Utilities intends to grow its business by providing its customers with gas supply, storage and asset management options; capturing value from increased natural gas gathering margins; providing producers with access to markets for their increased production; and arbitraging pipeline and storage assets across various gas markets and time horizons. In its underground storage business, Equitable Utilities will continue to invest capital to expand its operational capabilities by increasing storage deliverability, thereby providing an opportunity to capture increased value from the volatility in natural gas prices. Capturing this value from Equitable Utilities storage assets may increase the volatility of reported earnings from this business. Equitable Utilities will continue to focus on marketing energy to customers from its own assets; controlling costs; and managing its portfolio with smart business decisions while looking for additional opportunities to provide economical storage services in the regions in which the Companys utilities operate. Equitable Supply Overview Sale of Gas Properties In May 2005, the Company sold certain non core gas properties and associated gathering assets for proceeds of approximately $142 million after purchase price adjustments. The unit of production depletion rate (or DD&A rate) decreased by $0.04 per Mcfe prospectively as a result of this transaction. In accordance with SFAS No. 19, this sale of only a portion of the gas properties was treated as a normal retirement with no gain or loss recognized, as doing so did not significantly affect the DD&A rate. Purchase of Interest in Eastern Seven Partners, L.P. (ESP) In January 2005, the Company purchased the limited partnership interest in ESP for cash of $57.5 million and assumed liabilities of $47.3 million. Production related to this interest during 2005 totaled approximately 8.2 Bcf. The DD&A rate increased by $0.04 per Mcfe prospectively as a result of this transaction. 24 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % 2003 % OPERATIONAL DATA Capital expenditures (thousands) (a) $ 264,095 $ 141,661 86.4 $ 204,527 (30.7 ) Production: Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 73,909 67,731 9.1 64,306 5.3 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 5.17 $ 4.46 15.9 $ 3.91 14.1 Company usage, line loss (MMcfe) 4,897 5,090 (3.8 ) 5,501 (7.5 ) Natural gas inventory usage, net (MMcfe) (51 ) (61 ) (16.4 ) 112 (154.5 ) Natural gas and oil production (MMcfe) (b) 78,755 72,760 8.2 69,919 4.1 Lease operating expenses (LOE), excluding production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.29 $ 0.26 11.5 $ 0.23 13.0 Production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.49 $ 0.34 44.1 $ 0.28 21.4 Production depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 0.59 $ 0.54 9.3 $ 0.49 10.2 Gathering: Gathered volumes (MMcfe) 121,044 127,339 (4.9 ) 126,674 0.5 Average gathering fee ($/Mcfe) $ 0.82 $ 0.58 41.4 $ 0.55 5.5 Gathering and compression expense ($/Mcfe) $ 0.31 $ 0.28 10.7 $ 0.20 40.0 Gathering and compression depreciation ($/Mcfe) $ 0.12 $ 0.11 9.1 $ 0.09 22.2 (in thousands) Production operating income $ 260,931 $ 212,657 22.7 $ 172,384 23.4 Gathering operating income 32,650 14,712 121.9 23,411 (37.2 ) Total operating income $ 293,581 $ 227,369 29.1 $ 195,795 16.1 Production depletion $ 46,750 $ 39,100 19.6 $ 33,911 15.3 Gathering and compression depreciation 14,312 13,441 6.5 11,711 14.8 Other DD&A 3,835 3,295 16.4 3,126 5.4 Total DD&A $ 64,897 $ 55,836 16.2 $ 48,748 14.5 25 Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % 2003 % FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Production revenues $ 390,290 $ 315,986 23.5 $ 262,607 20.3 Gathering revenues (c) 98,901 74,442 32.9 69,827 6.6 Total operating revenues 489,191 390,428 25.3 332,434 17.4 Operating expenses: LOE, excluding production taxes 23,195 18,685 24.1 15,867 17.8 Production taxes (d) 38,288 24,589 55.7 19,820 24.1 Gathering and compression (O&M) 38,101 35,494 7.3 25,110 41.4 SG&A 30,610 28,455 7.6 27,094 5.0 Impairment charges 519 100.0 DD&A 64,897 55,836 16.2 48,748 14.5 Total operating expenses 195,610 163,059 20.0 136,639 19.3 Operating income $ 293,581 $ 227,369 29.1 $ 195,795 16.1 Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ 493 $ 688 (28.3 ) $ 431 59.6 Other income, net $ $ 576 (100.0 ) $ 100.0 Minority interest $ $ $ (871 ) (100.0 ) (a) 2005 capital expenditures include $57.5 million for the acquisition of the limited partnership interest in ESP. 2003 capital expenditures include $44.2 million for the purchase of the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in Appalachian Basin Partners, L.P.

Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. December 31, 2004 Equitable Supplys operating income totaled $293.6 million for 2005 compared to $227.4 million for 2004, an increase of $66.2 million between years. Production operating income increased $48.2 million primarily due to an increase in well head sales price and an increase in sales volumes, partially offset by increased production operating expenses. Gathering operating income increased $18.0 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses. Total operating revenues were $489.2 million for 2005 compared to $390.4 million for 2004. The $98.8 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to a 16% increase in the average well head sales price, a 9% increase in production total sales volumes and a 33% increase in gathering revenues. The $0.71 per Mcfe increase in the average well head sales price was mainly attributable to increased market prices on unhedged volumes partially offset by an adjustment of $10.6 million. The adjustment was principally due to the Companys conclusion that the well head sales price allocated to a third partys working interest gas in previous periods may have been lower than the Company was obligated to pay. The 9% increase in production total sales volumes was 26 primarily the result of the purchase of ESP, partially offset by the sale of certain non core gas properties. The 33% increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to a 41% increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by a 5% decline in gathered volumes. The increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program, along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases. The decrease in gathered volumes in 2005 was primarily due to the sale of certain non core gathering assets and third party customer volume shut ins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines. These factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for Company production in 2005. These increases in production and gathering revenues were partially offset by the recognition of a gain of $2.7 million in 2004 that resulted from the renegotiation of a processing agreement. Operating expenses totaled $195.6 million for 2005 compared to $163.1 million for 2004. A significant reason for this $32.5 million increase was due to additional costs of $15.0 million resulting from the purchase of ESP. The $15.0 million of costs were primarily related to DD&A ($4.7 million), production taxes ($4.6 million), lease operating expenses ($3.7 million) and gathering expenses ($2.0 million). Excluding the ESP costs, the $17.5 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $9.1 million in production taxes, $4.4 million in DD&A, $2.1 million in SG&A, $0.8 million in LOE, $0.6 million in gathering expenses and $0.5 million in impairment charges. The increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes ($5.4 million) and severance taxes ($3.7 million). The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years, as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the Companys wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The increase in severance taxes (a production tax directly imposed on the value of gas extracted) was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes. The increase in DD&A excluding ESP was due to a $0.05 per Mcf increase in the unit depletion rate ($4.3 million) and increased depreciation on a higher asset base ($1.4 million), partially offset by lower depletion as a result of decreased volumes from the sale of certain non core gas properties ($1.3 million). The increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 and 2004 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base. The increase in SG&A was the result of increased legal and professional fees and bad debt expenses. The increase in LOE was the result of the Companys strategy to focus on current infrastructure as well as increased costs from vendors due to higher gas prices. The increase in gathering expenses was primarily attributable to increased electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors, field labor and related employment costs and compressor station operation and repair costs. The gathering and compression increases are consistent with the Companys strategic decision to focus on improving gathering and compression and metering effectiveness. Such increases were partially offset by reductions in gathering expenses due to reduced gathered volumes. The impairment charges in 2005 were related to the Companys relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations to its new consolidated office space. Other income, net for 2004 was the result of a $6.1 million settlement received from a previously disputed insurance coverage claim, offset by a $5.5 million expense related to the Companys settlement of a prepaid forward contract in 2004. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs. December 31, 2003 Equitable Supplys operating income totaled $227.4 million for 2004 compared to $195.8 million for 2003. Total operating revenues were $390.4 million for 2004 compared to $332.4 million for 2003. The $58.0 million increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to a 14% increase in the average well head sales price, a 5% increase in production total sales volumes and a 7% increase in gathering revenues. The $0.55 per Mcfe increase in the average well head sales price was attributable to higher gas commodity prices, increased volumes at higher hedged prices and increased basis over the same period in 2003. The 5% increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of new wells drilled and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells. The increase in gathering revenues was attributable to a 6% increase in the average gathering fee and higher Equitable Production sales volumes (resulting in increased gathered volumes), partially offset by third party customer volume shut ins. Operating expenses were $163.1 million for 2004 compared to $136.6 million for 2003. This $26.5 million increase was due to increases of $10.4 million in gathering and compression expenses, $7.1 million in DD&A, $4.8 27 million in production taxes, $2.8 million in LOE, and $1.4 million in SG&A. The increase in gathering and compression expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compressor station operation and repair costs, field labor and related employment costs, field line maintenance costs and compressor electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors. The additional compression costs resulted from a 24% increase in horse power to approximately 112,000 horse power in 2004 from approximately 90,000 horse power in 2003. The increase in field labor was due to an increase in headcount related to Equitable Gatherings strategy to spend more time and resources to aggressively tend to the improvement of the base infrastructure. Actions taken by Equitable Gathering to support this strategy, such as the installation of compressor stations and facilities to reduce surface pressure and efforts related to reducing the internal curtailment of gas sales, increased compression and field line maintenance costs in 2004. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to a $0.05 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate, increased production volumes and capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions. The $0.05 per Mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate was due to the net development capital additions in 2003 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base. The increase in production taxes was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The increase in LOE was primarily due to a charge to earnings for environmental site assessments performed in accordance with the Companys amended Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) compliance plan and increased liability insurance premiums. The increase in SG&A was due to increased franchise taxes in 2004. See Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of Equitable Supplys capital expenditures during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Outlook Equitable Supplys business strategy is focused on achieving profit maximization by primarily focusing on developing new opportunities, through increased drilling and other development in the Appalachian Basin, as well as improvements to and expansion of its gathering systems, and secondarily focusing on cost control. The Company believes that the margin leverage from realizable gas prices outweighs the increase in unit cost structure necessary to implement this strategy. Key elements of Equitable Supplys strategy include: Expanding production through the drilling program. Equitable Supply has a multi year drilling program which will enable the Company to continue the growth of its production business. Equitable Supply intends to increase its drilling rate by over 20% to 550 wells in 2006. The Companys forecasted capital expenditures for 2006 include a 48% increase in expenditures related to Appalachian development. The Company believes that it has available on acreage it controls at least 4,600 net drilling locations on unproved properties, in addition to 2,292 net proved undeveloped drilling locations. Equitable Supply believes that its 692 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within a reasonable time period (currently estimated to be five years) because (1) Equitable Supply has completed substantially all of the wells it has drilled in the last three years, (2) Equitable Supply developed proved undeveloped reserves of 70 Bcfe and 62 Bcfe during 2005 and 2004, respectively, and (3) Equitable Supplys plans include developing similar levels of proved undeveloped reserves going forward. Maintaining and enhancing base well production. Equitable Supply will seek to maximize production of existing base wells by increased focus on maintenance, technology improvements and recompletions (deepening a well to another horizon or attempting to secure production from a shallower horizon). Through these activities, Equitable Supply can benefit from higher gas prices by obtaining accelerated volumes from its existing wells. Expanding the gathering system to support drilling and third party gathering revenues. The Company will continue to expand its pipeline and compression infrastructure in order to manage increased gathered volumes from both Company drilling programs and third party shippers. The Company plans to expand its gathering systems by approximately 190 miles of pipeline and approximately 20,000 horsepower of compression in 2006. Many of the existing pipelines will be increased in size to handle these additional volumes and new pipelines will be constructed to expanded drilling areas. The Company plans to build new compression stations as well as expand existing stations in order to transport these volumes to sales points on major interstate pipelines. 28 Investing in midstream gathering and processing in the Appalachian Basin. In a high price natural gas market, infrastructure needed to support increased drilling and to move gas from wellhead to market presents an acute need but also a significant opportunity for the Company. The Company has begun a significant new pipeline infrastructure project, the Big Sandy Pipeline. The 60 mile, 20 inch pipeline is expected to have a capacity of 70,000 dekatherms per day and will connect the Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant in Langley, Kentucky with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline interconnect in Carter County, Kentucky. The Big Sandy Pipeline is projected to cost a total of $83 million. The Company is also planning an upgrade to its Langley plant. These projects are scheduled for operation in 2007 and will enable the Company to further support its drilling growth, mitigate pipeline curtailments, increase flexibility and reliability of its midstream gathering systems and capitalize on third party producer demand in the Appalachian Basin. Natural gas processing expansion will continue to be required in order to meet the interstate pipeline gas quality standards and will represent an opportunity for the Company. The Company is looking at several processing, pipeline and compression expansion opportunities in Appalachia and expects to invest in additional projects in 2006 and beyond. Optimizing throughput of the existing gathering system. The Company will optimize its existing gathering assets by making technological improvements, upgrading existing compressors and eliminating bottlenecks in its gathering systems. While these initiatives will result in increased costs, the Company will continue to focus on ensuring that costs incurred in its gathering activities, both operating and capital, plus a reasonable rate of return on its gathering assets, are recovered in rates for transporting gas on its gathering systems. A part of this strategy includes increasing the rates that the Company charges to parties who transport gas on these systems. In certain instances, such rate increases require regulatory action. The Company expects the process of increasing gathering rates to extend beyond 2006. Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands) Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1,481 $ (18,936 ) $ 7,807 Gain on sale of available for sale securities, net 110,280 3,024 13,985 Other income, net 1,195 3,692 Gain on exchange of Westport for Kerr McGee shares 217,212 Charitable foundation contribution (18,226 ) (9,279 ) Equity earnings of Westport 3,614 As noted in Item 1, the Companys NORESCO business is classified as discontinued operations due to the sale of the NORESCO domestic business and pending sale of the Companys remaining international investment. Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2004 included approximately $23.9 million of after tax impairments on international investments and charges for related reserves, while income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2005 included the reversal of approximately $7.8 million of these reserves (after tax) due to improved business conditions in the related international markets, as well as a $6.4 million tax benefit from the reorganization of the Companys international assets in 2005. These increases in 2005 as compared to 2004 were partially offset by $18.7 million in after tax charges recorded in 2005, related to the recording of $13.7 million of income taxes on the sale and other costs incurred as a result of the sale transaction. During 2005, the Company sold its remaining 7.0 million Kerr McGee shares resulting in pre tax gains net of collar termination costs totaling $110.3 million. During 2004, the Company sold 0.8 million Kerr McGee shares, resulting in a pre tax gain of $3.0 million. During 2003, the Company sold approximately 1.5 million Westport shares, resulting in a pre tax gain of $14.0 million. 29 Other income, net includes pre tax dividend income relating to the Kerr McGee shares held by the Company of $1.2 million and $3.1 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. As a result of the 2004 merger between Westport and Kerr McGee, the Company recognized a gain of $217.2 million on the exchange of its Westport shares for Kerr McGee shares. See Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this transaction. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company established Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. to facilitate the Companys charitable giving program. This foundation received additional funding in the second quarter of 2004. See Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the charitable foundation contribution expense recorded upon contributions of Kerr McGee shares made to Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. during 2004. The Company reported $3.6 million in equity earnings from its minority ownership in Westport during the first quarter 2003. At the end of the first quarter of 2003, the Companys ownership position in Westport decreased below 20%. As a result of the decreased ownership, the Company changed the accounting treatment for its investment from the equity method to the available for sale method effective March 31, 2003. Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands) Interest expense $ 44,437 $ 42,520 $ 41,530 Interest expense increased by $1.9 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5% on September 30, 2005 and an increase in the average annual short term debt interest rate. These increases were partially offset by the maturity of $10 million of medium term notes during 2005. Interest expense increased by $1.0 million from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in short term borrowing activity during 2004 as well as an increase in the average annual short term debt interest rate. Average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 3.5%, 1.7% and 1.2% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating Activities Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $312.0 million for 2005 as compared to $180.0 million of cash flows provided by operating activities for 2004, a net increase of $492.0 in cash flows used in operating activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in operating activities was attributable to the following: an increase in margin deposit requirements on the Companys natural gas hedge agreements to $317.8 million as of December 31, 2005, from $36.9 million as of December 31, 2004. As further detailed under the captions Financing Activities and Short term Borrowings to follow, the Company has taken steps to ensure it has adequate liquidity for working capital and margin requirement needs; an increase in tax payments to $251.5 million in 2005 compared to $23.0 million in 2004, primarily due to the sale of the Companys Kerr McGee shares, the sale of the NORESCO discontinued operations and the sale of non core gas properties for significant taxable gains in 2005; an increase in inventory to $289.9 million as of December 31, 2005, from $204.6 million as of December 31, 2004, primarily due to increased natural gas prices on volumes stored in 2005 compared to 2004; 30 cash contributions of approximately $20.4 million to its pension plan during 2005 as compared to no contributions in 2004. partially offset by: an increase in accounts payable to $242.6 million as of December 31, 2005, from $171.2 million as of December 31, 2004, largely due to increased operating costs resulting from increased drilling activity and higher natural gas prices. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $180.0 million for 2004 as compared to $128.6 million for 2003, a $51.4 million increase between years. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following: increased collections from customers in 2004 as compared to 2003, driven primarily by increased net operating revenues in the Companys Supply segment; no cash contributions to the Companys pension plan in 2004, as compared to a cash contribution of $51.8 million in 2003; partially offset by: a $36.8 million payment in 2004 resulting from the Companys amendment of a prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004. This amendment resulted in the Company repaying the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract; Cash flows from operations were also affected by other working capital changes during 2004. Investing Activities Cash flows provided by investing activities totaled $347.7 million for 2005 as compared to $158.5 million of cash flows used in investing activities for 2004, a net increase of $506.2 million in cash flows provided by investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by investing activities was attributable to the following: proceeds of $460.5 million from the sale of the Companys remaining 7.0 million shares of Kerr McGee in 2005, as compared to proceeds of $42.9 million from the sale of 0.8 million shares of Kerr McGee in 2004; proceeds of $142.0 million from the sale of certain non core gas properties and associated gathering assets in 2005; proceeds of $80.0 million from the sale of the domestic operations of the Companys NORESCO business segment in 2005; partially offset by: an increase in capital expenditures to $333 million in 2005 from $202 million in 2004. See discussion of capital expenditures below. Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $158.5 million for 2004 as compared to $215.3 million for 2003, a net decrease of $56.8 in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures (see discussion of capital expenditures below) to $202 million in 2004 from $265 million in 2003. 31 Capital Expenditures 2006 Forecast 2005 Actual 2004 Actual 2003 Actual Development of Appalachian holdings (primarily drilling) $ 194 million $ 131 million $ 92 million $ 126 million plus $58 million for the purchase of ESP plus $44 million for the purchase of 31% of ABP Gathering system improvements and extensions $ 222 million $ 75 million $ 50 million $ 34 million Equitable Utilities $ 78 million $ 61 million $ 56 million $ 60 million Headquarters $ 3 million $ 8 million $ 4 million $ 1 million Total $ 497 million * $ 333 million $ 202 million $ 265 million * The 2006 capital expenditures include 2005 capital commitments totaling $105 million. Capital expenditures for Appalachian holdings development and gathering system improvements and extensions increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to an increased drilling and development plan in 2005. Such expenditures were lower in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in the level of development drilling in the Appalachian holdings to allow Equitable Supply to concentrate on its core assets and ensure a proper level of return on all new projects. Capital expenditures for Equitable Utilities increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to the installation of electronic meter reading technology on approximately 113,000 of the 265,000 meters in the Distribution Operations. The $17 million project to install electronic meter reading technology on all 265,000 meters is expected to be completed in 2006. The Company anticipates that the benefits from this project will result in approximately $2.0 million in annual cost savings. Capital expenditures for Equitable Utilities decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a decrease in technological enhancement project spending, partially offset by increased main line replacement costs and new business development spending. The Companys capital expenditures forecasted for 2006 represent a significant increase over capital expenditures in 2005. The $194 million targeted for the development of Appalachian holdings in 2006 represents a $63 million increase over 2005 which is attributable to an expanded drilling program in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. The $222 million forecasted for 2006 gathering system improvements and extensions includes a further expansion in infrastructure to support the Companys current and future drilling plans and expenditures for the Big Sandy Pipeline project. The pipeline, which is projected to cost a total of $83 million, including $53 million in the 2006 forecast, is scheduled for operation in 2007. The $78 million forecasted for Equitable Utilities includes $73 million for infrastructure improvements and $5 million for new business development. The infrastructure improvements include improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines, the continued installation of automated metering devices in the Distribution business and storage enhancements. The new business capital is planned for extensions of existing infrastructure into adjacent geographic areas. The Company expects to finance its capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and with short term debt. See discussion in the Short term Borrowings section below regarding the financing capacity of the Company. 32 Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $39.2 million for 2005 as compared to $55.8 million of cash flows used in financing activities for 2004, a net increase of $95.0 in cash flows provided by financing activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2004 to 2005 was attributable largely to the following: proceeds from the issuance in 2005 of $150 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5% and a maturity date of October 1, 2015; a decrease in current maturities of the Companys medium term notes of $10.5 million in 2005; partially offset by: less of an increase in amounts borrowed under short term loans in 2005 as compared to 2004; an increase in dividends paid to shareholders to $99.7 million in 2005 from $89.4 million in 2004; an increase in the cost to repurchase shares of the Companys outstanding common stock to $122.3 million for 3.6 million shares for 2005 from $118.5 million for 4.7 million shares for 2004. Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $55.8 million for 2004 as compared to $112.9 million of cash flows provided by financing activities for 2003, a net increase of $168.7 million in cash flows used in financing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used by financing activities from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to the following: a net increase of $75.0 million in long term debt during 2003 due to the issuance of $200 million of notes offset by the redemption of $125 million of Trust Preferred Securities, with no such items in 2004; an increase in the cost to repurchase shares of the Companys outstanding common stock to $118.5 million for 4.7 million shares in 2004 from $55.2 million for 2.9 million shares in 2003; an increase in dividends paid to shareholders to $89.4 million in 2004 from $60.4 million in 2003; The Company believes that cash generated from operations, amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the Company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position, are more than adequate to meet the Companys reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements. Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. The Companys $1 billion, five year revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other lawful purposes including support of the Companys commercial paper program. Historically, short term borrowings under the commercial paper program have been used mainly to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season. Due to continued higher than average natural gas prices and resulting increases in the Companys net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements, the Company also borrowed increased amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its interest bearing margin deposits under its exchange traded natural gas agreements. The amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005 was $365.3 million. Interest rates on these short term loans averaged 3.5% during 2005. 33 Security Ratings and Financing Triggers The table below reflects the current credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the Company. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Companys cost of short term and long term debt and its access to the credit markets. Rating Service Unsecured Medium Term Notes Commercial Paper Moodys Investors Service A 2 P 1 Standard & Poors Ratings Services A A 2 The Companys credit ratings on its non credit enhanced, senior unsecured long term debt, determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit; the lower the Companys credit rating, the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had no outstanding borrowings against these lines of credit. The Company pays facility fees to maintain credit availability. The Companys credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the credit rating agencies downgrade the Companys ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit the Companys access to the commercial paper market and borrowing costs would increase. In addition, the Company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, incur increased margin deposit requirements, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease. The Companys debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. The most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Companys current credit facilitys financial covenants require a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. This calculation excludes unrealized gains or losses from hedging transactions recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2005, the Company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. Commodity Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Companys risk management program includes the use of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts and options and OTC natural gas swap agreements and options (collectively, derivative commodity instruments) to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes. The preponderance of derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are fixed price swaps or NYMEX traded forwards. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company increased its hedge position for 2006 through 2012. The new hedges are collars, which protect revenues from decreases in natural gas prices below a floor but also limit the upside exposure to increases in prices to a cap. 34 The approximate volumes and prices of the Companys hedges for 2006 through 2008 are: 2006 2007 2008 Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 59 56 54 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 4.77 $ 4.74 $ 4.64 Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 7 7 7 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 7.35 $ 7.35 $ 7.35 Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 10.84 $ 10.84 $ 10.84 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf The Companys current hedged position provides price protection for a substantial portion of expected equity production for the years 2006 through 2008 and a significant portion of expected equity production for the years 2009 through 2012. The Companys exposure to a $0.10 change in average NYMEX natural gas price is less than $0.01 per diluted share for 2006 and ranges from $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share per year for 2007 and 2008. The Company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Investment Securities The Companys available for sale investments as of December 31, 2005 consist of approximately $25.2 million of equity securities that are intended to fund certain liabilities for which the Company is self insured. These investments are recorded at fair market value. During 2005, the Company sold all of its remaining 7.0 million shares of Kerr McGee in various transactions for total net pre tax proceeds of $460.5 million and a total pre tax gain of $110.3 million, net of $95.8 million in costs associated with the termination of the three related variable share forward transactions entered into in June 2004 subsequent to the Westport/Kerr McGee merger. The sale of these shares was determined by the Company to constitute the best use of this asset due to the significant appreciation in the value of the Kerr McGee shares during 2005. Other Items Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has a non equity interest in a variable interest entity, Appalachian NPI, LLC (ANPI), in which Equitable was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2005, ANPI had $243 million of total assets and $498 million of total liabilities (including $155 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. The Company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to ANPI, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations, and is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT). The Company received a market based fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2005, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately $43 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. The Company has entered into an agreement with ANGT to provide gathering and operating services to deliver ANGTs gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $15.5 million for 2005. 35 In connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic business, the Company through indirect subsidiaries has agreed to maintain certain guarantees which benefit NORESCO. These guarantees, the majority of which predate the sale of NORESCO, became off balance sheet arrangements upon the closing of the sale of NORESCO on December 30, 2005. These arrangements include guarantees of NORESCOs obligations to the purchasers of certain of NORESCOs contract receivables and agreements to maintain guarantees supporting NORESCOs obligations under certain customer contracts. In addition, NORESCO and the purchaser agreed that NORESCO would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and that the purchaser or NORESCO would reimburse the Company for losses under the guarantees. The purchasers obligations to reimburse the Company are capped at $6 million. The Company has performed an extensive review of these guarantees and of the underlying obligations and has determined that the likelihood the Company will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote. As such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees. The total maximum potential obligation under these arrangements is estimated to be approximately $512 million and will decrease over time as the guarantees expire or the underlying obligations are fulfilled by NORESCO. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys guarantees. Pension Plans Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003, excluding special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses, totaled $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The Company recognized special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003 of $18.4 million, $16.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively. As a result of these one time costs, the Companys projected benefit obligation decreased by approximately $34.6 million. During 2005, the Company settled its pension obligation with the United Steelworkers of America, Local Union 12050 representing 182 employees. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized a settlement expense of $12.1 million during 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company settled its pension obligation with certain non represented employees. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized a settlement expense of approximately $2.4 million in 2005. Effective December 31, 2004, the Company settled the pension obligation of those non represented employees (cash balance participants) whose benefits were frozen as of December 31, 2003. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized a one time settlement expense of $13.4 million in 2004. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $20.4 million to its pension plan during 2005 as a result of the previously described settlements. The Company expects to make a cash contribution of approximately $2.3 million to its pension plan during 2006. The Company was not required to, and consequently did not make any contribution to its pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company made cash contributions totaling $51.8 million to its pension plan during the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the Companys benefit obligation being significantly under funded. Incentive Compensation The Company has now fully transitioned to a long term incentive approach that is focused on performance restricted stock or units and time restricted stock. Management and the Board of Directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach more closely aligns managements incentives with shareholder rewards than is the case with traditional stock options. The Company has long utilized time restricted stock in its compensation plans and began issuing performance restricted units in 2002. No new stock options have been awarded since 2003. 36 The Company recorded the following incentive compensation expense in continuing operations for the periods indicated below: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (millions) Short term incentive compensation expense $ 12.9 $ 13.7 $ 9.5 Long term incentive compensation expense 46.4 28.3 16.6 Total incentive compensation expense $ 59.3 $ 42.0 $ 26.1 The long term incentive compensation expenses are primarily associated with Executive Performance Incentive Programs (the Programs). The long term incentive compensation expenses during 2005 were higher than during 2004 primarily due to a higher estimated share price for the Programs being expensed, as a result of the Companys share price appreciation, and a greater number of units granted under the current Programs as compared to the Programs in place during 2004. The long term incentive compensation expenses during 2004 were higher than during 2003 primarily as a result of the Companys share price appreciation as well. The Company currently estimates 2006 total incentive compensation expense of approximately $35 million, less than that incurred during 2005 due primarily to the payout of one of the Programs in December 2005. Federal Legislation The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act), which the President signed into law on October 22, 2004, was the first major corporate tax act in a number of years. Some of the key provisions of the Jobs Act include a new domestic manufacturing deduction, oil and gas producer incentives (not an extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit), new tax shelter penalties, restrictions on deferred compensation and numerous other issue specific provisions aimed at specific transactions. On September 29, 2005, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued proposed regulations providing deferred compensation guidance under the new legislation. During 2005, the Company completed its review of the legislations impact on its executive compensation plans and the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors decided to end the Companys deferred compensation programs for employees. As a result, the Company recorded $15.3 million in tax benefit disallowances under Section 162(m) of the IRC, primarily as the result of impairment of previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the employee deferred compensation programs and the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program. Rate Regulation The Companys Distribution Operations and Pipeline Operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed. Accounting for the Companys regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 71. As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. 37 Schedule of Contractual Obligations The following table details the future projected payments associated with the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011+ (Thousands) Long term debt $ 766,434 $ 3,000 $ 10,000 $ 4,300 $ 749,134 Interest expense 543,241 45,178 88,980 88,567 320,516 Purchase obligations 187,154 32,393 56,104 48,927 49,730 Operating leases 62,848 7,337 12,326 7,910 35,275 Other long term liabilities 89,860 89,860 Total contractual obligations $ 1,649,537 $ 87,908 $ 257,270 $ 149,704 $ 1,154,655 Included within the purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately $31.4 million relating to the Companys natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing long term contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to ten years. Approximately $20.0 million of these costs are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as a limited amount of equipment. In May 2005, the Company completed the relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations to a newly constructed office building located at the North Shore in Pittsburgh. The base rent payments under the new North Shore lease of approximately $2.3 million per year have been included in the table above. The relocation resulted in the early termination of several operating leases for facilities deemed to have no economic benefit to the Company. These obligations, which totaled $10.1 million as of December 31, 2005, are also included in operating lease obligations detailed above. The other long term liabilities line represents the total estimated payout for the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of this obligation. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments At the end of the useful life of a well, the Company is required to remediate the site by plugging and abandoning the well. Costs incurred during 2005, 2004 and 2003 for such activities were not material to the Company and are not expected to be material to operating results in future periods. The various regulatory authorities that oversee Equitables operations will, from time to time, make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the Company. It is the Companys policy to comply with applicable laws and cooperate when regulatory bodies make requests. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingent liabilities and commitments. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized by the Company at the time the obligation is incurred. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 by the Company resulted in an after tax charge to earnings of $3.6 million, which was reflected as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the Companys Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. 38 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon Equitables Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed and approved by the Companys Audit Committee, relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Equitable Gas encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable. As such, Equitable Gas records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision, Equitable Gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable write offs as a percentage of total revenue. This historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis and is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate, such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather. Both of these items ultimately impact the customers ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the pass through of purchased gas costs to the customers. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. For 2005, the monthly provision for uncollectible accounts was established at approximately 2% of residential sales, a decrease from the 4% rate utilized for 2004. Beginning in April 2004, the Company began collecting a regulatory surcharge in the amount of $0.30 per Mcfe of gas sold to residential customers to help recover the costs associated with providing gas service to low income customers. This surcharge is credited to the reserve for uncollectible accounts and reduces the amount which would otherwise be recognized as bad debt expense. This surcharge totaled $6.5 million in 2005 and $3.3 million in 2004. In addition, during 2004, Equitable Gas implemented a new customer information and billing system that has enabled the Company to better segment customer information in order to identify customers who may have difficulty paying. Also, under the Responsible Utility Customer Protection Act which became effective in Pennsylvania in December 2004, Equitable Gas is permitted to send winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250% of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the PA PUC. The Company took advantage of these winter terminations during 2005 in an effort to reduce its uncollectible accounts receivable. Despite the continued increases in natural gas prices throughout 2005, the Company expects to realize a decrease in accounts written off as a result of these initiatives and has consequently reduced its provision for doubtful accounts. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts are critical accounting estimates because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the changes in the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital. The actual weather, commodity prices and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from managements assumptions and may impact the ultimate collectibility of customer accounts. Additionally, the regulatory environment allows certain customers to enter into long term payment arrangements, the ultimate collectibility of which is difficult to determine. Executive Performance Incentive Programs: The Company treats its Executive Performance Incentive Programs as variable plans. The awards under the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program vested in December 2005. The actual cost to be recorded for the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2005 Program) will not be known until the measurement date, which is in December 2008, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized. The number of units to be paid out under the 2005 Program is dependent upon a combination of a level of total shareholder return relative to the performance of a peer group and the Companys average absolute return on capital during the four year performance period. The Company reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual for the 2005 Program when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the value of the ultimate payout. In the current period, the Company 39 estimated that the performance measures would be met at 175% of the full value of the units for the 2005 Program and that the estimated end of 2008 share price would be $45.00. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the 2005 Program is a critical accounting estimate because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the Companys shares and the performance of the peer group. Additionally, the impact on net income of these changes could be material. Managements assumptions about future stock price and Company performance relative to the peer group requires significant judgment. Each companys inherent volatility combined with the volatility in commodity prices impact the ultimate amount of the payout and make it difficult to provide sensitivity metrics to demonstrate what impact a change in the Companys stock price will have on the estimate. However, assuming no change in the attainment of performance measures, a 10% increase in the Companys stock price assumptions for December 31, 2008 would result in an increase in 2006 compensation expense under the 2005 Program of approximately $4 million. A 10% decrease in the Companys stock price assumptions would result in a decrease in 2006 compensation expense of the same amount. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Please read Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from mark to market hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss, deferred revenues and expenses and state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. The Company also recorded a $15.3 million charge in 2005 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain executive compensation plans, as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the IRC. No other valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Evidence used includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Commodity Instruments The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily through the Equitable Supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the Equitable Utilities segment. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption Commodity Risk Management in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K. The Company uses simple, non leveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed 40 with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Companys forecasted production, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels, which are exposed to price risk. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company include futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements, which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity. The Company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. In general, the Companys strategy is to hedge production at prices considered to be favorable to the Company. The Company attempts to take advantage of price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when market prices move above historical averages and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below these levels. The goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility. To the extent that the Company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price, the Company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas. For derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes, the marketing group engages in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company for trading purposes include forward contracts and swap agreements. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2005, the Company had hedged portions of expected equity production through 2012 by utilizing futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 311.0 Bcf of natural gas. See the Commodity Risk Management and Capital Resources and Liquidity sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10 K for further discussion. A decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2005 levels would increase the fair value of natural gas instruments by approximately $268.3 million. An increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas would decrease the fair value by approximately $282.1 million. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for trading purposes as of December 31, 2005, an increase or decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2005 levels would not have a significant impact on the fair value. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal change in fair value as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at December 31, 2005. The price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Companys balance sheet, resulting in the change in fair value. The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected. 41 If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. Other Market Risks The Company has variable rate short term debt. As such, there is some exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the Company under its current capital structure. The Company maintains fixed rate long term debt that is not subject to risk exposure from fluctuating interest rates. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value. NYMEX traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties. The Company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the Companys criteria for credit and liquidity strength. 42
