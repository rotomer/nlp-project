Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Equitables consolidated income from continuing operations for 2006 was $216.0 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, compared with $258.6 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, for 2005, and $298.8 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, for 2004. The $42.6 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2006 included the impact of several factors. In 2005, the Company recognized a pre tax gain of $110.3 million on the sale of Kerr McGee Corporation (Kerr McGee) shares. In 2006, the Company incurred $12.3 million of transition planning expenses relating to the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. The Company also established a reserve for West Virginia royalty disputes. The impact of lower realized selling prices ($25.8 million) and warmer weather ($9.3 million) also contributed to the decrease between years. Decreases in income from continuing operations between years were partially offset by 2005 charges of $16.0 million for the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and of $7.8 million for the Companys office consolidation, as well as the 2006 favorable impact of the Equitrans rate case settlement. Additionally, income from continuing operations for 2006 was positively impacted by reduced expenses related to the executive performance incentive programs ($22.7 million), favorable storage asset optimization ($16.4 million), and higher production sales volumes ($11.6 million). The $40.2 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2004 to 2005 was primarily the result of several factors. The Company recorded a gain in 2004 as a result of the Westport Resources Corporation (Westport)/Kerr McGee merger in the second quarter of 2004 as well as a gain on the sale of 0.8 million Kerr McGee shares subsequent to the merger. These gains were partially offset by an expense related to the Companys charitable contribution of 0.4 million Kerr McGee shares to the Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. in 2004. The 2005 gain from the sale of the Companys remaining Kerr McGee shares partially offset the impact of the 2004 items. Income from continuing operations was favorably impacted in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher realized selling prices, an increase in sales volumes from production and increased revenues from storage asset optimization. These increases were offset in some part by increased operating costs resulting primarily from higher natural gas prices and sales volumes, increased incentive expenses and impairment charges related to the Companys office consolidation. The Companys effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, was 33.7% compared to 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005, and 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The higher effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily the result of tax benefit disallowances under Section 162(m) of the IRC. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, and other income, net. Interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive costs, pension costs and administrative costs totaling $21.9 million, $48.0 million and $45.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were not allocated to business segments. The decrease in unallocated expenses from 2005 to 2006 was primarily related to decreased long term incentive expenses. The Company has reconciled each segments operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income, net to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income, net totals in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. Equitables management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitables segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. Equitable Utilities Overview Equitable Utilities net operating revenues increased 8.5% from 2005 to 2006. This increase was primarily due to increased pipeline revenues from the settlement of the Equitrans rate case effective June 1, 2006, as well as favorable marketing revenues resulting from volatile natural gas prices, as the marketing operations were able to take advantage of their asset position and achieve record margins from that business in 2006. The marketing business is primarily driven by Equitable Utilities physical and contractual gas storage assets which allow the segment to purchase gas and store it in lower price markets and simultaneously enter into contracts to sell it later at higher prices, taking advantage of near term seasonal gas price spreads. Those spreads are unpredictable and at times were considerably wider in 2006 than they were in 2005. The positive results from the pipeline and marketing operations were partially offset by reduced revenues in Equitable Utilities distribution operations, as the weather in Equitable Gas service territory in 2006 was 15% warmer than the 30 year average and 10% warmer than 2005. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that the 2006 average annual temperature for the contiguous U.S. was the warmest on record. NOAA also reported that, based on the unusually warm temperatures during much of the first half of the winter season (October to December 2006), the nations residential energy demand was approximately 13.5 percent lower than what would have occurred under average climate conditions for the season. Operating expenses at Equitable Utilities decreased 3%, driven primarily by the absence of charges related to pension plans and the Companys office consolidation that occurred in 2005, offset somewhat by transition planning expenses incurred in 2006 related to the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. and the recognition of costs previously deferred as a result of the Equitrans rate case settlement. Expenses were also positively impacted by a reduction in bad debt expense. In 2006, Equitable continued its consistent and aggressive collections strategy as permitted by The Responsible Utility Customer Protection Act, which became effective on December 14, 2004. In December 2005, the PA PUC approved Equitable Gass petition requesting approval to use up to $7 million of pipeline supplier refunds to benefit low income customers in its service territory, primarily during the winter heating season. Approximately $4.9 million and $0.3 million of this amount was credited to eligible customers accounts during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The execution of the collections strategy and provision of additional customer energy assistance enabled Equitable Utilities to reduce its delinquent customer base by 20% as of December 2006 compared to December 2005. These efforts were significant in enabling Equitable Utilities to reduce its bad debt expense in 2006, despite unusually high gas cost rates in effect during 2006 and 2005. On March 1, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Dominion Resources, Inc.s natural gas distribution assets in Pennsylvania and in West Virginia for approximately $970 million, subject to adjustments, in a cash transaction for the stock of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. The transaction requires approvals from the PA PUC and the WV PSC and is also under review by the Pennsylvania Attorney General and by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). On February 9, 2007 an administrative law judge for the PA PUC issued an initial decision approving the stock acquisition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Joint Petition for Settlement filed by the Company and a number of the intervening parties. The Joint Petition for Settlement includes, among other things, an agreement by the Company that Equitable Gas Company and The Peoples Natural Gas Company will not make base rate case filings prior to January 1, 2009. Under the Commissions rules a period for filing exceptions and reply exceptions has begun to run. Based upon the thorough 23 manner in which the administrative law judge addressed the testimony of opposing parties, the Company believes it likely that the PA PUC will approve the stock acquisition when it reviews the application in March or April of 2007. The WV PSC procedural schedule calls for hearings in mid May 2007. The WV PSC staff and consumer advocate, the Independent Oil and Gas Association of West Virginia and the Utility Workers Union of America Local 69 Division 1 have intervened in the West Virginia regulatory case. The Company continues to engage in settlement negotiations with these interveners. The Company is complying with the information requests of the Pennsylvania Attorney General and the FTC and is targeting an approval timeframe not long after receiving approval from the PA PUC. No assurance is given that the targeted timeframes will be achieved. The Companys acquisition agreement expires on March 31, 2007 unless a closing has not occurred due to a failure to obtain a required governmental consent or authorization and such is being diligently pursued, in which case the expiration date is automatically extended to June 30, 2007. The agreement will then terminate if no closing occurs by June 30, 2007, unless the parties agree to an extension. With the relatively recent repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Company has filed applications with the PA PUC and WV PSC to reorganize as a holding company. Currently, Equitable Gas is a division of Equitable Resources, Inc., which requires the Company to obtain regulatory approval for many actions that are not directly related to the distribution operations, such as acquisitions and financings. This requirement restricts the Companys ability to take advantage of opportunities and market conditions. The Company successfully completed a request for direction to holders of notes under the indentures governing its long term debt. Upon receipt of the other required approvals, the Company expects to complete the reorganization. In 2006, the Company expensed $1.6 million of costs related to the holding company implementation. 24 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % change 2006 2005 2004 % change 2005 2004 OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,829) 4,976 5,543 (10.2 ) 5,360 3.4 Residential sales and transportation volume (MMcf) 21,014 24,680 (14.9 ) 25,520 (3.3 ) Commercial and industrial volume (MMcf) 23,841 25,368 (6.0 ) 29,597 (14.3 ) Total throughput (MMcf) Distribution Operations 44,855 50,048 (10.4 ) 55,117 (9.2 ) Net operating revenues (thousands): Distribution Operations (regulated): Residential $ 92,497 $ 102,457 (9.7 ) $ 104,612 (2.1 ) Commercial & industrial 42,519 46,857 (9.3 ) 48,563 (3.5 ) Other 8,319 7,544 10.3 5,950 26.8 Total Distribution Operations 143,335 156,858 (8.6 ) 159,125 (1.4 ) Pipeline Operations (regulated) 72,586 53,767 35.0 55,123 (2.5 ) Energy Marketing 59,089 42,739 38.3 28,457 50.2 Total net operating revenues $ 275,010 $ 253,364 8.5 $ 242,705 4.4 Total operating expenses as a % of net operating revenues 54.47 % 61.22 % 55.44 % Operating income (thousands): Distribution Operations (regulated) $ 34,807 $ 40,322 (13.7 ) $ 56,877 (29.1 ) Pipeline Operations (regulated) 33,240 17,345 91.6 24,656 (29.7 ) Energy Marketing 57,162 40,587 40.8 26,616 52.5 Total operating income $ 125,209 $ 98,254 27.4 $ 108,149 (9.1 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (thousands): Distribution Operations $ 19,938 $ 19,483 2.3 $ 17,474 11.5 Pipeline Operations 8,737 8,317 5.0 7,985 4.2 Energy Marketing 56 74 (24.3 ) 170 (56.5 ) Total DD&A $ 28,731 $ 27,874 3.1 $ 25,629 8.8 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 64,974 $ 61,349 5.9 $ 56,274 9.0 25 Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % change 2006 2005 2004 % change 2005 2004 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Distribution revenues (regulated) $ 445,168 $ 469,102 (5.1 ) $ 422,438 11.0 Pipeline revenues (regulated) 74,010 57,534 28.6 55,123 4.4 Marketing revenues 380,149 365,625 4.0 300,513 21.7 Less: intrasegment revenues (56,163 ) (45,804 ) 22.6 (46,213 ) (0.9 ) Total operating revenues 843,164 846,457 (0.4 ) 731,861 15.7 Purchased gas costs 568,154 593,093 (4.2 ) 489,156 21.2 Net operating revenues 275,010 253,364 8.5 242,705 4.4 Operating expenses: Operating and maintenance (O & M) 58,186 57,315 1.5 52,481 9.2 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 65,280 66,080 (1.2 ) 56,446 17.1 Impairment charges (2,396 ) 3,841 (162.4 ) 100.0 DD&A 28,731 27,874 3.1 25,629 8.8 Total operating expenses 149,801 155,110 (3.4 ) 134,556 15.3 Operating income $ 125,209 $ 98,254 27.4 $ 108,149 (9.1 ) Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. December 31, 2005 Equitable Utilities operating income totaled $125.2 million for 2006 compared to $98.3 million for 2005. Equitable Utilities operating income increased $26.9 million primarily due to increased net marketing revenues, lower expenses related to defined benefit pension plans, increased pipeline operating income, reduction in bad debt expense, an impairment charge in 2005 in connection with the Companys office consolidation and a gain in 2006 as a result of the partial reversal of the office impairment charge recorded in 2005. These improvements are partially offset by the impact of costs incurred in planning for the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas Inc. and a reduction in distribution gas sales margins due to weather 15% warmer than the 30 year average. Net operating revenues were $275.0 million for 2006 compared to $253.4 million for 2005. The $21.6 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased pipeline and marketing net operating revenues, partially offset by lower distribution net operating revenues. Pipeline operations net operating revenues increased $18.8 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the settlement of Equitrans 2003 FERC rate case and the implementation of new rates and contracts in connection with that settlement. The settlements approval, which occurred in April 2006, improved net operating revenues by $7.0 million related to years 2005 and prior and an additional $5.7 million related to the transfer of certain gathering assets from Equitable Supply. New contract rates and billing determinants in the settlement result in the remaining $6.1 increase in pipeline net operating revenues. The increase in marketing net operating revenues of $16.4 million resulted primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in the volatile natural gas commodity price environment. Distribution operations net operating revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to decreased residential sales and transportation volumes, which decreased 3,666 MMcf from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to warmer weather. Operating expenses totaled $149.8 million for 2006 compared to $155.1 million for 2005. Operating expenses for 2005 included $16.0 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a $3.8 million loss related to the impairment of certain leased offices, furniture and equipment in connection with the Companys relocation into its new, consolidated office space. Operating expenses for 2006 include $12.3 million of costs incurred in planning for the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas 26 Company and Hope Gas, Inc.; a $2.9 million increase in gathering expenses as a result of the transfer of certain assets from Equitable Supply; the recognition of $4.6 million of previously deferred post retirement benefit obligation expenses in the pipeline business, both in connection with the FERC rate case settlement; and the reversal of $2.4 million of the 2005 office impairment charge, as the space previously abandoned was put back into use for the transition planning activities relating to the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. Excluding these items, operating expenses decreased $2.9 million, which was primarily a result of decreases in distribution and marketing bad debt expense totaling $5.2 million, offset by increases of $0.9 million in depreciation expense and $0.8 million in general liability insurance expenses. The improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of non paying customers, improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process. The increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in Equitable Utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software, distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. December 31, 2004 Equitable Utilities operating income totaled $98.3 million for 2005 compared to $108.1 million for 2004. Net operating income for 2005 included charges for the termination and settlement of defined benefit pension plans and an impairment charge in connection with the Companys office consolidation. Net operating revenues were $253.4 million for 2005 compared to $242.7 million for 2004. The $10.7 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased marketing net operating revenues of $14.2 million, resulting primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in a high and increasingly volatile natural gas commodity price environment. Distribution operations net operating revenues decreased $2.2 million due to decreased volumes. Distribution operations residential sales and transportation volumes decreased 840 MMcf from 2004 to 2005 due to decreased base load and lower customer use per degree day. These reductions resulted from increased customer conservation, more timely termination of non paying customers in 2005 and other factors. Increased volumes as a result of colder weather partially offset these decreases in residential volumes, as heating degree days were 5,543 in 2005, which was 3% colder than the 5,360 heating degree days in 2004 although still warmer than normal. Distribution operations commercial and industrial volumes decreased 4,229 MMcf from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a reduction in industrial throughput to two major steel making customers. These high volume industrial sales have very low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. Pipeline operations net operating revenues decreased $1.3 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a $3.8 million loss on fuel and retention in excess of the current rates. This loss was partially offset by increased revenues earned in loaning and parking services. These services are contracted on an as available basis, as opposed to long term firm storage contracts. This flexibility allows customers, including the Companys marketing affiliate, to take advantage of the pipelines available storage to secure future supply at favorable prices. These services were heavily subscribed in 2005, as higher volatility in natural gas prices provided substantial value for storage options. Operating expenses totaled $155.1 million for 2005 compared to $134.6 million for 2004. Operating expenses for 2005 included $16.0 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a $3.8 million loss related to the impairment of certain leased offices, furniture and equipment in connection with the Companys relocation into its new, consolidated office space. Excluding these items, operating expenses increased $0.7 million, which resulted from increases of $2.3 million in depreciation expense, $2.2 million in incentive compensation, $1.4 million in customer operations expenses and $1.1 million in employee benefit costs, largely offset by decreases of $4.7 million in bad debt expense and $1.4 million in insurance costs. The increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in Equitable Utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software, distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices. The improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of non paying customers, a full year impact of a $0.30 per Mcf regulatory surcharge instituted in April 2004, improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process. These improvements were offset somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2005 by high commodity rates and cold weather, which resulted in increased provisions for bad debt in that period compared to the prior year. 27 See Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of Equitable Utilities capital expenditures during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Outlook Equitable Utilities business strategy is focused on operational excellence. Success in this strategy depends upon efficiently and effectively operating its gas distribution assets to optimize a return on assets. Going forward, Equitable Utilities expects to grow its gas distribution business selectively by acquisition. It also expects to continue to develop a portfolio of closely related unregulated businesses. Key elements of Equitable Utilities strategy include: Enhancing the value and growth potential of the regulated utility operations. Equitable Utilities will seek to enhance the value and growth of its existing utility assets by managing its capital spending effectively; establishing a reputation for excellent customer service; continuing to leverage technology; working to achieve authorized returns in each jurisdiction and, in those jurisdictions where it has performance based rates, sharing the benefits with its customers; and maintaining earnings and rate stability through regulatory arrangements that fairly balance the interests of customers and shareholders. Closing and integrating the acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. Equitable Utilities is focused on obtaining the required regulatory approvals to close the acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. Transition planning activities have commenced at Equitable Utilities to plan for the integration of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. into Equitable Resources, with $12.3 million of expenses incurred through December 31, 2006. The assets to be acquired will increase: customers in the distribution operations by 475,000 or 173%; total storage capacity by 33 Bcf or 60%, miles of gathering pipelines by 936 miles; gathered volumes by 40%; and miles of high pressure transmission by 466 miles or 42%. Based on the work completed to date, the Company expects that the conversion activities will continue at a similar monthly rate through June 2007 and increase Equitable Utilities operating expenses in the first and second quarter of 2007 in anticipation of closing the transaction. Selectively expanding Equitable Utilities natural gas storage and gathering operations. Equitable Utilities will endeavor to continue to expand its natural gas storage and gathering businesses to provide disciplined incremental earnings growth for shareholders. Equitable Utilities also intends to continue to invest capital in its underground storage business to expand its operational capabilities by increasing storage deliverability, thereby providing an opportunity to capture increased value from the volatility in natural gas prices. Equitable Utilities intends to grow its asset management business by providing its customers with gas supply, storage and asset management options; capturing value from increased natural gas gathering margins; providing producers with access to markets for their increased production; and arbitraging pipeline and storage assets across various gas markets and time horizons. Capturing this value from Equitable Utilities storage assets may increase the volatility of reported earnings from this business. Equitable Utilities will continue to focus on marketing energy to customers from its own assets; controlling costs; and managing its portfolio with smart business decisions while looking for additional opportunities to provide economical storage services in the regions in which the Company operates. 28 Equitable Supply Overview Equitable Supplys sales revenues for 2006 were essentially flat in comparison with 2005 revenues. Sales volumes increased more than 5% from 2005 excluding volumes from properties sold during 2005, primarily as a result of increased production from the 2006 and 2005 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys existing wells. Equitable Supply drilled 560 gross operated wells in 2006 compared to 420 gross operated wells in 2005, a 33% increase. The 560 operated wells included 5 horizontal wells and 16 wells drilled as part of a coal bed methane infill pilot. The positive results experienced from the increased sales volumes were more than offset by a 7% decline in the average well head sales price, due primarily to decreased market prices. The average NYMEX price decreased 16% in 2006 from the abnormally high price levels in 2005, negatively impacting revenues from sales of unhedged volumes. Operating expenses at Equitable Supply increased 12% primarily due to certain non recurring charges for royalty disputes, bad debt expenses and pension and other postretirement plans, as well as higher DD&A and gathering and compression expenses resulting from increased drilling and infrastructure investments, as the Company continues to expand its development and midstream activities in the Appalachian Basin. 29 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % change 2006 2005 2004 % change 2005 2004 OPERATIONAL DATA Capital expenditures (thousands) (a) $ 336,748 $ 264,095 27.5 $ 141,661 86.4 Production: Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 76,156 73,909 3.0 67,731 9.1 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 4.83 $ 5.17 (6.6 ) $ 4.46 15.9 Company usage, line loss (MMcfe) 5,215 4,897 6.5 5,090 (3.8 ) Natural gas inventory usage, net (MMcfe) (51 ) 100.0 (61 ) (16.4 ) Natural gas and oil production (MMcfe) (b) 81,371 78,755 3.3 72,760 8.2 Lease operating expenses (LOE), excluding production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.30 $ 0.29 3.4 $ 0.26 11.5 Production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.48 $ 0.49 (2.0 ) $ 0.34 44.1 Production depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 0.62 $ 0.59 5.1 $ 0.54 9.3 Gathering: Gathered volumes (MMcfe) 108,592 121,044 (10.3 ) 127,339 (4.9 ) Average gathering fee ($/Mcfe) $ 1.02 $ 0.82 24.4 $ 0.58 41.4 Gathering and compression expense ($/Mcfe) $ 0.42 $ 0.31 35.5 $ 0.28 10.7 Gathering and compression depreciation ($/Mcfe) $ 0.14 $ 0.12 16.7 $ 0.11 9.1 (in thousands) Production operating income $ 231,849 $ 260,931 (11.1 ) $ 212,657 22.7 Gathering operating income 37,315 32,650 14.3 14,712 121.9 Total operating income $ 269,164 $ 293,581 (8.3 ) $ 227,369 29.1 Production depletion $ 50,330 $ 46,750 7.7 $ 39,100 19.6 Gathering and compression depreciation 15,411 14,312 7.7 13,441 6.5 Other DD&A 4,759 3,835 24.1 3,295 16.4 Total DD&A $ 70,500 $ 64,897 8.6 $ 55,836 16.2 30 Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % change 2006 2005 2004 % change 2005 2004 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Production revenues $ 377,626 $ 390,290 (3.2 ) $ 315,986 23.5 Gathering revenues (c) 110,945 98,901 12.2 74,442 32.9 Total operating revenues 488,571 489,191 (0.1 ) 390,428 25.3 Operating expenses: LOE, excluding production taxes 24,620 23,195 6.1 18,685 24.1 Production taxes (d) 38,653 38,288 1.0 24,589 55.7 Gathering and compression (O&M) 45,860 38,101 20.4 35,494 7.3 SG&A 39,774 30,610 29.9 28,455 7.6 Impairment charges 519 (100.0 ) 100.0 DD&A 70,500 64,897 8.6 55,836 16.2 Total operating expenses 219,407 195,610 12.2 163,059 20.0 Operating income $ 269,164 $ 293,581 (8.3 ) $ 227,369 29.1 Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ 129 $ 493 (73.8 ) $ 688 (28.3 ) Other income, net $ $ $ 576 (100.0 ) (a) 2005 capital expenditures include $57.5 million for the acquisition of the limited partnership interest in Eastern Seven Partners, L.P.

Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. December 31, 2005 Equitable Supplys operating income totaled $269.2 million for 2006 compared to $293.6 million for 2005, a decrease of $24.4 million between years. Production operating income decreased $29.1 million primarily due to a decrease in well head sales price and an increase in production operating expenses, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Gathering operating income increased $4.7 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses. Total operating revenues were $488.6 million for 2006 compared to $489.2 million for 2005. The $0.6 million decrease in net operating revenues was primarily due to a 7% per Mcfe decrease in the average well head sales price, partially offset by a 3% increase in production total sales volumes and a 12% increase in gathering revenues. The $0.34 per Mcfe decrease in the average well head sales price was mainly attributable to decreased market prices on unhedged volumes and increased gathering charges, partially offset by the absence of a 2005 31 negative price adjustment. The 2005 adjustment was principally due to the Companys conclusion that the well head sales price allocated to a third partys working interest gas in previous periods may have been lower than the Company was obligated to pay. The 3% increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the 2006 and 2005 drilling programs, partially offset by the sale of certain non core gas properties in 2005 and the normal production decline in the Companys wells. The 12% increase in gathering revenues was attributable to a 24% increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by a 10% decline in gathered volumes. The increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program, along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases. The average gathering fee was also positively impacted by the transfer of certain regulated gathering facilities to Equitable Utilities. The decrease in gathered volumes in 2006 was primarily due to the transfer of gathering facilities to Equitable Utilities, the sale of gathering assets in 2005 and third party customer volume shut ins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines. These factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for Company production in 2006. Operating expenses totaled $219.4 million for 2006 compared to $195.6 million for 2005. The $23.8 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $9.2 million in SG&A, $7.8 million in gathering and compression, $5.6 million in DD&A, $1.4 million in LOE, and $0.4 million in production taxes, partially offset by a $0.5 million impairment charge in 2005 related to the Companys office consolidation. The increase in SG&A was the result of reserves established in connection with West Virginia royalty disputes and bad debt expenses. The increase in gathering and compression was primarily due to pension and other postretirement benefits charges for an early retirement program totaling $3.3 million, increased compressor station operation and repair costs, including electricity on newly installed compressors, increased property taxes and increased field labor and related employment costs. These factors were partially offset by the transfer of gathering facilities to Equitable Utilities and the sale of gathering assets in 2005. The increase in DD&A was due to a $0.03 per Mcf increase in the unit depletion rate ($2.0 million), increased depreciation on a higher asset base ($2.0 million) and increased produced volumes ($1.6 million). The increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base. The increase in LOE was primarily due to increased direct well expenses and well and location repairs and maintenance, partially offset by the sale of gas properties in 2005. The increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes ($2.4 million), partially offset by decreased severance taxes ($2.0 million). The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years, as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the Companys wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The decrease in severance taxes (a production tax directly imposed on the value of gas extracted) was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes. The impairment charges in 2005 were related to the Companys relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations of its new consolidated office space. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. December 31, 2004 Equitable Supplys operating income totaled $293.6 million for 2005 compared to $227.4 million for 2004, an increase of $66.2 million between years. Production operating income increased $48.2 million primarily due to an increase in well head sales price and an increase in sales volumes, partially offset by increased production operating expenses. Gathering operating income increased $18.0 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses. Total operating revenues were $489.2 million for 2005 compared to $390.4 million for 2004. The $98.8 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to a 16% increase in the average well head sales price, a 9% increase in production total sales volumes and a 33% increase in gathering revenues. The $0.71 per Mcfe increase in the average well head sales price was mainly attributable to increased market prices on unhedged volumes partially offset by the adjustment related to a third partys working interest gas as previously discussed. The 9% increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the purchase of ESP, partially offset by the sale of gas properties. The 33% increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to a 41% increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by a 5% decline in gathered volumes. The increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program, along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases. The decrease in gathered volumes in 2005 was primarily due to the sale of gathering assets and third party customer volume shut ins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines. These factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for Company production in 2005. These increases 32 in production and gathering revenues were partially offset by the recognition of a gain of $2.7 million in 2004 that resulted from the renegotiation of a processing agreement. Operating expenses totaled $195.6 million for 2005 compared to $163.1 million for 2004. A significant reason for this $32.5 million increase was due to additional costs of $15.0 million resulting from the purchase of ESP. The $15.0 million of costs were primarily related to DD&A ($4.7 million), production taxes ($4.6 million), lease operating expenses ($3.7 million) and gathering expenses ($2.0 million). Excluding the ESP costs, the $17.5 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $9.1 million in production taxes, $4.4 million in DD&A, $2.1 million in SG&A, $0.8 million in LOE, $0.6 million in gathering expenses and $0.5 million in impairment charges related to the Companys office consolidation. The increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes ($5.4 million) and severance taxes ($3.7 million). The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years. The increase in severance taxes was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes in 2005 as compared to prior years. The increase in DD&A excluding ESP was due to a $0.05 per Mcf increase in the unit depletion rate ($4.3 million) and increased depreciation on a higher asset base ($1.4 million), partially offset by lower depletion as a result of decreased volumes from the sale of gas properties ($1.3 million). The increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 and 2004. The increase in SG&A was the result of increased legal and professional fees and bad debt expenses. The increase in LOE was the result of the Companys strategy to focus on current infrastructure as well as increased costs from vendors due to higher gas prices. The increase in gathering expenses was primarily attributable to increased electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors, field labor and related employment costs and compressor station operation and repair costs. The gathering and compression increases are consistent with the Companys strategic decision to focus on improving gathering and compression and metering effectiveness. Such increases were partially offset by reductions in gathering expenses due to reduced gathered volumes. Other income, net for 2004 was the result of a $6.1 million settlement received from a previously disputed insurance coverage claim, offset by a $5.5 million expense related to the Companys settlement of a prepaid forward contract in 2004. See Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of Equitable Supplys capital expenditures during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Outlook Equitable Supplys Appalachian Basin business strategy is focused on growing through expansion of its drilling program and gathering systems. The Company will continue to emphasize operational excellence, including cost control in all areas of its operations. Key elements of Equitable Supplys strategy include: Expanding production through the drilling program. Equitable Supply has a multi year drilling program which includes increased drilling of conventional wells, down spacing coal bed methane wells, continuing its horizontal drilling efforts and selectively participating in non operated wells developed on acreage held by the Company. These efforts will enable the Company to continue the growth of its production business. Equitable Supply intends to drill 650 gross operated wells in 2007, including at least 25 horizontal wells, a 16% increase over the 560 gross operated wells drilled in 2006. Through testing a variety of horizontal drilling techniques, the Company expects to better understand reservoir response and the economic viability of reserve development through horizontal drilling. Similarly, through the ongoing infill pilot, the Company will evaluate the economic viability of accelerating production by down spacing coal bed methane wells. Equitable Supply believes that its 772 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within a reasonable time period (currently estimated to be five years) because Equitable Supply (i) completed substantially all of the wells it drilled in the last three years and (ii) developed proved undeveloped reserves of 60 Bcfe and 70 Bcfe during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Equitable Supplys plans include developing similar levels of proved undeveloped reserves going forward. 33 Investing in midstream gathering and processing in the Appalachian Basin. Infrastructure to support the Companys increased drilling, to mitigate curtailments on and increase flexibility and reliability of gathering systems and to move gas from wellhead to market presents an acute need but also a significant opportunity for the Company. Through its Equitrans affiliate, the Company is constructing the Big Sandy Pipeline, which will provide for a significant increase in midstream throughput capacity. The Company is also planning an upgrade to the Company operated hydrocarbon processing plant in Langley, Kentucky for completion in early 2008. The projects are projected to cost an aggregate of $191 million. The Company plans to expand its gathering systems by approximately 200 miles of gathering line and approximately 25,000 horsepower of compression in 2007. Many of the existing gathering lines will be increased in size to handle these additional volumes and new gathering lines will be constructed to expanded drilling areas. The Company plans to build new compression stations as well as expand existing stations in order to transport gas to sales points on interstate pipelines. The Company is also evaluating several other processing, gathering line and compression expansion opportunities in Appalachia and expects to invest in additional projects in 2007 and beyond. These efforts will assist the Company to move not only its gas, but also third party producer gas, from wellhead to market. Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Thousands) Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 4,261 $ 1,481 $ (18,936 ) Gain on sale of available for sale securities, net 110,280 3,024 Other income, net 1,195 3,692 Gain on exchange of Westport for Kerr McGee shares 217,212 Charitable foundation contribution (18,226 ) As noted in Item 1, the Companys NORESCO business is classified as discontinued operations due to the sale of the NORESCO domestic business in 2005 and sale of the Companys remaining international investment in early 2006. Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2006 included a tax benefit of $3.2 million due to a reduced tax liability on the sale and after tax income of $1.1 million resulting from the Companys reassessment of its remaining obligations for costs incurred related to the sale. Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2004 included approximately $23.9 million of after tax impairments on international investments and charges for related reserves, while income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2005 included the reversal of approximately $7.8 million of these reserves (after tax) due to improved business conditions in the related international markets, as well as a $6.4 million tax benefit from the reorganization of the Companys international assets in 2005. These increases in 2005 as compared to 2004 were partially offset by $18.7 million in after tax charges recorded in 2005, related to the recording of $13.7 million of income taxes on the sale and other costs incurred as a result of the sale transaction. During 2005, the Company sold its remaining 7.0 million Kerr McGee shares resulting in pre tax gains net of collar termination costs totaling $110.3 million. During 2004, the Company sold 0.8 million Kerr McGee shares, resulting in a pre tax gain of $3.0 million. Other income, net includes pre tax dividend income relating to the Kerr McGee shares held by the Company of $1.2 million and $3.1 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. 34 As a result of the 2004 merger between Westport and Kerr McGee, the Company recognized a gain of $217.2 million on the exchange of its Westport shares for Kerr McGee shares. See Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this transaction. In 2004, the Company contributed approximately 0.4 million Kerr McGee shares to Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc., resulting in the Company recording a charitable foundation contribution expense of $18.2 million during 2004. See Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this transaction. Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Thousands) Interest expense $ 47,052 $ 44,437 $ 42,520 Interest expense increased by $2.7 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to a full year of interest expense in 2006 from the issuance of $150 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5% on September 30, 2005 and an increase in the average annual short term debt interest rate, partially offset by lower average short term debt during 2006. Interest expense increased by $1.9 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5% on September 30, 2005 and an increase in the average annual short term debt interest rate. These increases were partially offset by the maturity of $10 million of medium term notes during 2005. Average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 4.6%, 3.5%, and 1.7% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $619.3 million for 2006 as compared to $312.0 million of cash flows used in operating activities for 2005, a net increase of $931.3 million in cash flows provided by operating activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following: a $598.7 million net reduction in cash required for margin deposit requirements on the Companys natural gas hedge agreements, primarily due to significantly higher than normal gas prices in 2005 which resulted in increased deposit remittances in that year; a decrease in tax payments to $58.6 million in 2006 from $251.5 million in 2005, primarily due to taxes paid in 2005 related to the sale of the Companys Kerr McGee shares, the sale of the NORESCO discontinued operations and the sale of non core gas properties for significant taxable gains, all in 2005; a decrease in accounts receivable of $63.5 million in 2006 compared to an increase of $78.0 million in 2005, primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005; a decrease in inventory of $20.8 million during 2006 as compared to an increase of $85.3 million in 2005, primarily due to increased natural gas prices on volumes stored in 2005 as well as decreased prices in 2006; 35 partially offset by: a decrease in accounts payable of $29.3 million in 2006 compared to an increase of $71.5 million in 2005, primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005; a large reduction in other current liabilities during 2006, as significant amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2005 for which payment was remitted shortly after the 2005 year end. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $312.0 million for 2005 as compared to $180.0 million of cash flows provided by operating activities for 2004, a net increase of $492.0 in cash flows used in operating activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in operating activities was attributable to the following: an increase in margin deposit requirements to $317.8 million as of December 31, 2005, from $36.9 million as of December 31, 2004, primarily resulting from increased natural gas prices during 2005; an increase in tax payments to $251.5 million in 2005 compared to $23.0 million in 2004 as described above; an increase in inventory to $289.9 million as of December 31, 2005, from $204.6 million as of December 31, 2004, primarily due to increased natural gas prices on volumes stored in 2005 compared to 2004; partially offset by: an increase in accounts payable to $242.6 million as of December 31, 2005, from $171.2 million as of December 31, 2004, largely due to increased operating costs resulting from increased drilling activity and higher natural gas prices. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $407.7 million for 2006 as compared to $347.7 million of cash flows provided by investing activities for 2005, a net increase of $755.4 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following: net proceeds of $460.5 million received from the sale of approximately 7.0 million shares of Kerr McGee Corporation common stock in 2005; proceeds of $142.0 million from the sale of certain non core gas properties and associated gathering assets in 2005; an increase in capital expenditures to $404.5 million in 2006 from $275.8 million in 2005. See discussion of capital expenditures below; proceeds of $80.0 million from the sale of the domestic operations of the Companys NORESCO business segment in 2005; partially offset by: the Companys acquisition of the 99% limited partnership interest in ESP for $57.5 million in 2005. 36 Cash flows provided by investing activities totaled $347.7 million for 2005 as compared to $158.5 million of cash flows used in investing activities for 2004, a net increase of $506.2 million in cash flows provided by investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by investing activities was attributable to the following: a $417.6 million year over year increase in net proceeds received from the sale of shares of Kerr McGee; proceeds of $142.0 million from the sale of properties in 2005; proceeds of $80.0 million from the sale of NORESCO in 2005; partially offset by: an increase in capital expenditures to $333.3 million in 2005 from $201.8 million in 2004. See discussion of capital expenditures below. Capital Commitments and Expenditures The Company forecasts $588 million of capital commitments for 2007. This forecast includes $237 million for well development, $256 million for Supply infrastructure, $92 million for Equitable Utilities and $3 million for Headquarters. A portion of these capital commitments is not expected to impact cash flow until 2008 and beyond. Capital Expenditures 2007 Forecast 2006 Actual 2005 Actual 2004 Actual Well development (primarily drilling) $ 231 million $ 200 million $131 million plus $58 million for the purchase of ESP $ 92 million Supply infrastructure $ 396 million $ 137 million $ 75 million $ 50 million Equitable Utilities $ 82 million $ 65 million $ 61 million $ 56 million Headquarters $ 3 million $ 3 million $ 8 million $ 4 million Total* $ 712 million * $ 405 million $ 333 million $ 202 million * The 2007 capital expenditures do not include amounts related to the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. The 2007 capital expenditures include 2006 capital commitments totaling $361 million, including $257 million for Supply infrastructure, $92 million for well development, and $12 million for Equitable Utilities. Capital expenditures for well development and Supply infrastructure increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increased drilling and development plan in 2006, capital expended for construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline and other throughput optimization projects. Capital expenditures for well development and Supply infrastructure increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to an increased drilling and development plan in 2005. Capital expenditures for Equitable Utilities increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased transmission pipeline replacement associated with pipeline integrity under The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and increased gathering infrastructure expenditures. Capital expenditures for Equitable Utilities increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to the installation of electronic meter reading technology on meters in the distribution operations, a project that was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2006. 37 The Companys capital expenditures forecasted for 2007 represent a significant increase over capital expenditures in 2006. The $231 million targeted for well development in 2007 represents a $31 million increase over 2006 which is attributable to an expanded drilling program. The $396 million forecasted for 2007 Supply infrastructure includes further expansions in infrastructure to support the Companys current and future drilling plans as well as expenditures for the Big Sandy Pipeline and Langley plant projects. The $82 million forecasted for Equitable Utilities includes $77 million for infrastructure improvements and $5 million for new business development. The infrastructure improvements include improvements to existing distribution lines, an increase in transmission pipeline replacement and additional investment in gathering system improvements and extensions. The new business capital is planned for extensions of existing infrastructure into adjacent geographic areas. The Company expects to finance its capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and with short term debt. See discussion in the Short term Borrowings section below regarding the financing capacity of the Company. Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $286.5 million for 2006 as compared to $39.2 million of cash flows provided by financing activities for 2005, a net increase of $325.7 million in cash flows used in financing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in financing activities was attributable largely to the following: a $229.3 million decrease in amounts borrowed under short term loans in 2006 compared to a $69.8 million increase in short term borrowings in 2005. The decrease in short term borrowings in 2006 was primarily the result of decreased requirements for funding margin deposits as previously discussed; proceeds in 2005 from the September 2005 issuance of $150.0 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5% and a maturity date of October 1, 2015; partially offset by: no repurchases of shares of the Companys outstanding common stock under the Companys share repurchase program during 2006 in anticipation of the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc., compared to repurchases of $122.3 million of common stock in 2005. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $39.2 million for 2005 as compared to $55.8 million of cash flows used in financing activities for 2004, a net increase of $95.0 million in cash flows provided by financing activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2004 to 2005 was attributable largely to the following: proceeds of $150.0 million from the issuance of notes in September 2005; partially offset by: less of an increase in amounts borrowed under short term loans in 2005 as compared to 2004. The Company believes that cash generated from operations, amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the Company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position, are more than adequate to meet the Companys reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements. The Company anticipates financing its capital expenditures and the pending acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. through a combination of debt, equity, and asset sales. 38 Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. The Companys $1.5 billion, five year revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other purposes including support of the Companys commercial paper program. Historically, short term borrowings under the commercial paper program have been used mainly to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season. Due to decreased natural gas prices and increased margin deposit thresholds with financial institutions during 2006 and resulting decreases in the Companys net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements, the Company borrowed decreased amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its interest bearing margin deposits under its natural gas hedge agreements. The amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006 was $136.0 million. Interest rates on these short term loans averaged 4.6% during 2006. Security Ratings and Financing Triggers The table below reflects the current credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the Company. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Companys cost of short term and long term debt and its access to the credit markets. Rating Service Unsecured Medium Term Notes Commercial Paper Moodys Investors Service A 2 P 1 Standard & Poors Ratings Services A A 2 On March 2, 2006, Standard & Poors Ratings Services placed the Companys short and long term credit ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications and Moodys Investors Service placed the ratings under review for possible downgrade. These actions resulted from the Companys announcement that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc., subject to anti trust and regulatory approvals. The final ratings outcomes are expected to be determined after the acquisition financing plan has been reviewed by the ratings agencies and the regulatory approval process is near completion. The Companys credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the credit rating agencies downgrade the Companys ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit the Companys access to the commercial paper market and borrowing costs would increase. In addition, the Company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, incur increased margin deposit requirements with respect to its hedging instruments, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease. The Companys credit ratings on its non credit enhanced, senior unsecured long term debt determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit; the lower the Companys credit rating, the higher the level of fees and interest rate. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no outstanding borrowings against these lines of credit. The Company pays facility fees to maintain credit availability. The Companys debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. The most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations, and change of control provisions. The Companys current credit facilitys financial covenants require a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes accumulated other comprehensive income 39 (loss). During an acquisition period, which is defined as the period beginning with the funding of the purchase price for the stock of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. and ending on the first fiscal quarter end at least 365 days after the funding of such purchase price, the covenant is relaxed from 65% to 70%. As of December 31, 2006, the Company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. Commodity Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Companys risk management program includes the use of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts and options and OTC natural gas swap agreements and options (collectively, derivative commodity instruments) to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes. The preponderance of derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are fixed price swaps or collars. During 2006, the Company increased its hedge position for 2007 through 2013. As a result, the approximate volumes and prices of the Companys total hedge position for 2007 through 2009 are: 2007 2008 2009 Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 56 54 38 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 4.74 $ 4.64 $ 5.90 Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 10 10 10 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 7.61 $ 7.61 $ 7.61 Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 11.27 $ 11.27 $ 11.27 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf The Companys current hedged position provides price protection for a substantial portion of expected equity production for the years 2007 through 2009 and a significant portion of expected equity production for the years 2010 through 2013. The Companys exposure to a $0.10 change in average NYMEX natural gas price is approximately $0.01 per diluted share for 2007 and ranges from $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share per year for 2008 and 2009. The Company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Investment Securities The Companys available for sale investments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 consist of approximately $31.3 million and $25.2 million, respectively, of equity securities that are intended to fund certain liabilities for which the Company is self insured. These investments are recorded at fair market value. During 2005, the Company sold all of its remaining 7.0 million shares of Kerr McGee in various transactions for total net pre tax proceeds of $460.5 million and a total pre tax gain of $110.3 million, net of $95.8 million in costs associated with the termination of the three related variable share forward transactions entered into in June 2004 subsequent to the Westport/Kerr McGee merger. Other Items Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has a non equity interest in a variable interest entity, Appalachian NPI, LLC (ANPI), in which Equitable was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2006, ANPI had $214 million of total assets and $336 million of total liabilities (including $137 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. 40 The Company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to ANPI, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations, and is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT). The Company received a market based fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately $50 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. The Company has entered into an agreement with ANGT to provide gathering and operating services to deliver ANGTs gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $16.8 million for 2006. In connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic business in 2005, the Company agreed to maintain certain guarantees which benefit NORESCO. These guarantees, the majority of which predate the sale of NORESCO, became off balance sheet arrangements upon the closing of the sale of NORESCO. These arrangements include guarantees of NORESCOs obligations to the purchasers of certain of NORESCOs contract receivables and agreements to maintain guarantees supporting NORESCOs obligations under certain customer contracts. In addition, NORESCO and the purchaser agreed that NORESCO would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and that the purchaser or NORESCO would reimburse the Company for losses under the guarantees. The purchasers obligations to reimburse the Company are capped at $6 million. The Company determined that the likelihood the Company will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote, and as such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees. The total maximum potential obligation under these arrangements is estimated to be approximately $484 million as of December 31, 2006, and decreases over time as the guarantees expire or the underlying obligations are fulfilled by NORESCO. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys guarantees. Pension Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which requires an employer to recognize a benefit plans funded status in its statement of financial position, measure a benefit plans assets and obligations as of the end of the employers fiscal year and recognize the changes in the benefit plans funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 158s requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the new disclosure requirements were effective for the year ended December 31, 2006. See Footnote 13 for information regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2006, 2005 and 2004, excluding special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses, totaled $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The Company recognized special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2006, 2005 and 2004 of $3.0 million, $18.4 million and $16.2 million, respectively. As a result of these costs, the Companys projected benefit obligation decreased by approximately $36.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a settlement expense of approximately $2.7 million for an early retirement program. During 2005, the Company settled its pension obligation with the United Steelworkers of America, Local Union 12050 representing 182 employees. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized a settlement expense of $12.1 million during 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company settled its pension obligation with certain non represented employees. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized a settlement expense of approximately $2.4 million in 2005. Effective December 31, 2004, the Company settled the pension obligation of those non represented employees (cash balance participants) whose benefits were frozen as of December 31, 2003. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized settlement expense of $13.4 million in 2004. 41 The Company made cash contributions of approximately $1.8 million and $20.4 million to its pension plan during 2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of the previously described settlements. The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $1.0 million to its pension plan during 2007. The Company was not required to, and consequently did not make any contribution to its pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2004. Incentive Compensation The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, which results in the Company recognizing compensation cost for all forms of share based payments to employees, including employee stock options, as an expense in its income statement. The Company previously applied APB No. 25 in accounting for its share based compensation and consequently did not recognize any compensation cost for its stock option awards. The Companys estimate of compensation cost for stock options is based on the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes model is considered a theoretical or probability model used to estimate the price an option would sell for in the market today. The Company does not represent that this method yields an exact value of what an unrelated third party (i.e., the market) would be willing to pay to acquire such options. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method, under which the Company recorded compensation expense for its unvested stock options beginning January 1, 2006. As such, the Company did not restate any prior period income statement amounts. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R did not result in any significant changes to the Companys method for valuing its stock options from that previously used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R did not have a significant impact on the Companys operating results for 2006, as the Company has shifted its compensation focus to the issuance of performance based units and time restricted stock awards for which it already recognized compensation expense under generally accepted accounting principles. Management and the Board of Directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach more closely aligns managements incentives with shareholder rewards than is the case with traditional stock options. No new stock options have been awarded since 2003; all stock options granted subsequent to 2003 have comprised options granted for reload rights associated with previously awarded options. The Company recorded approximately $1.0 million of compensation expense related to stock options in 2006, the majority of which related to stock option reloads which immediately vested under the terms of the related stock option award agreements. The majority of the Companys previously issued stock options were already vested at the time of adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and associated compensation expense yet to be recognized was insignificant. All stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2006 are fully vested, and as such, the Company does not anticipate incurring any additional compensation expense related to currently outstanding stock options. Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for prior periods stock option grants consistent with the methodology prescribed in SFAS No. 123R, net income would have been reduced by an estimated $1.5 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, for 2005, and an estimated $4.2 million, or approximately $0.04 per diluted share, for 2004. The Company recorded the following incentive compensation expense in continuing operations for the periods indicated below: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (millions) Short term incentive compensation expense $ 16.7 $ 12.9 $ 13.7 Long term incentive compensation expense 26.6 46.4 28.3 Total incentive compensation expense $ 43.3 $ 59.3 $ 42.0 42 The long term incentive compensation expenses are primarily associated with Executive Performance Incentive Programs (the Programs) that were instituted starting in 2002. The long term incentive compensation expenses during 2006 were lower than during 2005 due to a greater number of unvested units outstanding during 2005 than during 2006, as there were two Programs in effect during 2005 and only one in 2006. The long term incentive compensation expenses during 2005 were higher than during 2004 primarily due to a higher estimated share price for the Programs being expensed, as a result of the Companys share price appreciation, and a greater number of unvested units outstanding during 2005 than during 2004. The Company currently estimates 2007 total incentive compensation expense of approximately $38 million. Federal Legislation During 2005, the Company completed its review of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004s impact on the Companys executive compensation plans, and the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors decided to end the Companys deferred compensation programs for employees. As a result, in 2005 the Company recorded $15.3 million in tax benefit disallowances under Section 162(m) of the IRC, primarily due to the impairment of previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the employee deferred compensation programs and the 2003 Executive Performance Incentive Program. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations and pipeline operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed. Accounting for the Companys regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 71. As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. Schedule of Contractual Obligations The following table details the future projected payments associated with the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012+ (Thousands) Long term debt $ 763,500 $ 10,000 $ 4,300 $ 6,000 $ 743,200 Interest expense 497,705 44,663 88,526 87,860 276,656 Purchase obligations 211,716 41,126 68,670 57,203 44,717 Operating leases 55,964 6,767 10,273 6,108 32,816 Other long term liabilities 87,152 87,152 Total contractual obligations $ 1,616,037 $ 102,556 $ 258,921 $ 157,171 $ 1,097,389 Included within the purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately $37.8 million relating to the Companys natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing long term contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to ten years. Approximately $26.4 million of these costs are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as a limited amount of equipment. The relocation of the Company to a new corporate headquarters in 2005 resulted in the early termination of several operating leases for facilities deemed to have no economic benefit to the Company. These obligations, which totaled $6.6 million as of December 31, 2006, are included in operating lease obligations detailed above. 43 The other long term liabilities line represents the total estimated payout for the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of this obligation. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments The various regulatory authorities that oversee Equitables operations will, from time to time, make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the Company. It is the Companys policy to comply with applicable laws and cooperate when regulatory bodies make requests. In June 2006, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals issued a decision involving interpretation of certain types of oil and gas leases of an unrelated party, in which a class of royalty owners in the state of West Virginia filed a lawsuit claiming that the defendant in the case underpaid royalties by deducting certain post production costs not permitted by such types of leases and not paying a fair value for the gas produced from the royalty owners leases. In January 2007, the jury in the aforementioned case returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff royalty owners, awarding the plaintiffs significant compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged underpayment of royalties. While the defendant plans to appeal the verdict, this decision may ultimately impact other royalty interest rights in West Virginia. Claims have been brought against others in the oil and gas industry, including the Company. The actions against the Company are in the early stages of proceedings. The Company believes that the claims and facts decided in the unrelated lawsuit can be differentiated from those asserted against the Company. Nevertheless, the Company has reviewed its West Virginia royalty agreements and established a reserve it believes to be appropriate. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingent liabilities and commitments. 44 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon Equitables Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed and approved by the Companys Audit Committee, relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Provision for Doubtful Accounts: The Company encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable. Equitable Gass state regulated relationship with its customers is particularly complex. Equitable Gas records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision, Equitable Gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable write offs as a percentage of total revenue. This historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis and is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate, such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather. Both of these items ultimately impact the customers ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the pass through of purchased gas costs to the customers. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. The monthly provision for uncollectible accounts amounted to approximately 1% and 2% of residential sales for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Beginning in April 2004, the Company began collecting a regulatory surcharge in the amount of $0.30 per Mcfe of gas sold to residential customers to help recover the costs associated with providing gas service to low income customers. This surcharge is credited to the reserve for uncollectible accounts and reduces the amount which would otherwise be recognized as bad debt expense. This surcharge totaled $5.5 million in 2006, $6.5 million in 2005, and $3.3 million in 2004. In addition, during 2004, Equitable Gas implemented a new customer information and billing system that has enabled the Company to better segment customer information in order to identify customers who may have difficulty paying. Also, under the Responsible Utility Customer Protection Act, Equitable Gas is permitted to send winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250% of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the PA PUC. The Company took advantage of these winter terminations in an effort to reduce its uncollectible accounts receivable. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts are critical accounting estimates because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the changes in the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital. The actual weather, commodity prices and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from managements assumptions and may impact the ultimate collectibility of customer accounts. Additionally, the regulatory environment allows certain customers to enter into long term payment arrangements, the ultimate collectibility of which is difficult to determine. Executive Performance Incentive Programs: The Company treats its Executive Performance Incentive Programs as variable plans. The actual cost to be recorded for the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2005 Program) will not be known until the measurement date, which is December 31, 2008, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized. The number of units to be paid out under the 2005 Program is dependent upon a combination of a level of total shareholder return relative to the performance of a peer group and the Companys average absolute return on capital during the four year performance period. The Company reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual for the 2005 Program when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the value of the ultimate payout. In the current period, the Company estimated that the performance measures would be met at 175% of the full value of the units for the 2005 Program and that the estimated end of 2008 share price would be $45.00. 45 The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the 2005 Program is a critical accounting estimate because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the Companys shares and the performance of the peer group. Additionally, the impact on net income of these changes could be material. Managements assumptions about future stock price and Company performance relative to the peer group requires significant judgment. Each companys inherent volatility combined with the volatility in commodity prices impact the ultimate amount of the payout and make it difficult to provide sensitivity metrics to demonstrate what impact a change in the Companys stock price will have on the estimate. However, assuming no change in the attainment of performance measures, a 10% increase in the Companys stock price assumptions for December 31, 2008 would result in an increase in 2007 compensation expense under the 2005 Program of approximately $6 million. A 10% decrease in the Companys stock price assumptions would result in a decrease in 2007 compensation expense of the same amount. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from mark to market hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss, deferred revenues and expenses and state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. The Company also recorded a $0.1 million charge in 2006 and a $15.3 million charge in 2005 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain executive compensation plans, as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the IRC. No other valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Evidence used includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Contingencies: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The recording of contingencies is guided by the principles of SFAS No. 5. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to contingencies is a critical accounting estimate because future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. 46 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Commodity Instruments The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily through the Equitable Supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the Equitable Utilities segment. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption Commodity Risk Management in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K. The Company uses non leveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. Commodity Price Risk The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in commodity prices. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Companys forecasted production, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels, which are exposed to price risk. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company include futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements, which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity. The Company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. In general, the Companys strategy is to hedge production at prices considered to be favorable to the Company. The Company attempts to take advantage of price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when market prices move above historical averages and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below these levels. The goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility. To the extent that the Company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price, the Company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2006, the Company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2013 by utilizing futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 310.1 Bcf of natural gas. See the Commodity Risk Management and Capital Resources and Liquidity sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10 K for further discussion. For the sensitivity analysis set forth below, the Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal change in fair value as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at December 31, 2006. The price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Companys balance sheet, resulting in the change in fair value. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2006 levels would increase the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $222.3 million. A hypothetical increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2006 levels would decrease the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $221.8 million. The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks 47 within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected. If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. For derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes, the Company engages in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company for trading purposes include forward contracts and swap agreements. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2006 levels would not have a significant impact on the fair value of derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for trading purposes as of December 31, 2006. Other Market Risks The Company has variable rate short term debt. As such, there is some exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the Company under its current capital structure. The Company maintains fixed rate long term debt that is not subject to risk exposure from fluctuating interest rates. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value. The Company believes that NYMEX traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties. The Company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the Companys criteria for credit and liquidity strength. 48
