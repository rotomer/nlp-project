Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Equitables consolidated income from continuing operations for 2007 was $257.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared with $216.0 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, for 2006, and $258.6 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, for 2005. The $41.5 million increase in income from continuing operations from 2006 to 2007 resulted from several factors including the 2007 pre tax gain of $126.1 million on the sale of assets in the Nora area and a $17.0 million increase in production revenues at Equitable Supply. At Equitable Utilities, increases in marketing revenues due to favorable storage asset optimization opportunities that were captured at a time of unusually high commodity price volatility which settled in the first quarter of 2007, and increases in distribution revenues due to colder weather in Equitable Gass service territory contributed to the increase in income from continuing operations over 2006. The increases in revenue between years were partially offset by a $46.2 million increase in incentive compensation expense, the $10.1 million write off of deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the proposed acquisition of Peoples and Hope, and $9.7 million in higher depletion, depreciation and amortization, primarily at Equitable Supply. In addition, higher labor costs and charges for certain legal reserves, settlements and related expenses partially offset the increases in income from continuing operations. The $42.6 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2006 included the impact of several factors. In 2005, the Company recognized a pre tax gain of $110.3 million on the sale of Kerr McGee Corporation (Kerr McGee) shares. In 2006, the Company incurred $12.3 million of transition planning expenses relating to the now terminated acquisition of Peoples and Hope. The Company also recorded a reserve for certain legal disputes. The impact of lower realized selling prices ($25.8 million) and warmer weather ($9.3 million) also contributed to the decrease between years. These unfavorable effects on income from continuing operations between 2005 and 2006 were partially offset by 2005 charges of $16.0 million for the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and of $7.8 million for the Companys office consolidation, as well as the 2006 favorable impact of the Equitrans rate case settlement. Additionally, income from continuing operations for 2006 was positively impacted by reduced expenses related to the executive performance incentive programs ($22.7 million), favorable storage asset optimization ($16.4 million), and higher production sales volumes ($11.6 million). The Companys effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007, was 35.9% compared to 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006, and 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The higher effective tax rate in 2007 is the result of several factors including a change in the West Virginia state tax law and a reduced 2006 rate resulting from the release of state valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryovers. The higher effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily the result of tax benefit disallowances under Section 162(m) of the IRC. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, and other income. Interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive costs, pension costs and administrative costs totaling $65.3 million, $21.9 million and $48.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were not allocated to business segments. The higher unallocated expenses in 2007 and 2005 compared to 2006 primarily relate to lower long term incentive expenses in 2006. The Company has reconciled each segments operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity in earnings of 24 nonconsolidated investments and other income totals in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. Equitables management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitables segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. As discussed in Item 1 above, the Company realigned its business segments in January 2008. Equitable Supply Overview Equitable Supply is focused on organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program. The Company drilled 634 gross wells (456 net) wells in 2007, including 88 horizontal shale wells. Proved reserves increased 165 Bcfe (7%) to 2,682 Bcfe during the year. Equitable Supplys revenues for 2007 increased 3% compared to 2006 revenues. Despite a $0.37 decrease in the average NYMEX price in 2007, the average well head sales price increased 3% as a result of a less unfavorable hedge impact compared to 2006 and favorable liquids prices. Sales volumes increased more than 5% from 2006, excluding volumes from properties sold during 2007, primarily as a result of increased production from the 2007 and 2006 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys producing wells. Operating expenses at Equitable Supply increased 9% primarily due to charges for legal reserves, settlements and related expenses, as well as higher depletion resulting from increased drilling investments as the Company continues to expand its development in the Appalachian Basin. During 2007, the Equitable Supply segment sold to Pine Mountain Oil and Gas, Inc. (PMOG), a subsidiary of Range Resources Corporation (Range), a portion of the Companys interests in certain gas properties in the Nora area totaling approximately 74 Bcf of proved reserves. Also during 2007, the Equitable Supply segment contributed certain Nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to Nora Gathering, LLC, a newly formed entity that is equally owned by the Company and PMOG, in exchange for a 50% equity interest in the LLC and cash. These transactions resulted in a net gain of $126.1 million. See Note 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. As a result of the gathering asset contribution, gathered volumes, gathering revenues and gathering related expenses related to the Nora area gathering activities are no longer included in Equitable Supplys operating results. However, Equitable Supply records its 50% equity interest in the earnings of Nora Gathering, LLC in equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments. The Company is working to obtain the third party consents required to complete the transaction on a portion of the property not included in the 2007 closing. A final closing covering the remainder of the gas properties and related remaining gathering assets included in the above transactions would reduce the Companys proved reserves by a maximum of approximately 9 Bcf. During the third quarter of 2007, the Equitable Supply segment purchased an additional working interest of approximately 13.5% in certain gas properties in the Roaring Fork area totaling approximately 12.3 Bcf of proved reserves and certain gathering assets from the minority interest holders. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction. 25 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % change 2007 2006 2005 % change 2006 2005 OPERATIONAL DATA Production: Natural gas and oil production (MMcfe) (a) 83,114 81,371 2.1 78,755 3.3 Company usage, line loss (MMcfe) (6,035 ) (5,215 ) 15.7 (4,897 ) 6.5 Natural gas inventory usage, net (MMcfe) 51 (100.0 ) Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 77,079 76,156 1.2 73,909 3.0 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 4.98 $ 4.83 3.1 $ 5.17 (6.6 ) Lease operating expenses (LOE), excluding production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.31 $ 0.29 6.9 $ 0.28 3.6 Production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.44 $ 0.48 (8.3 ) $ 0.49 (2.0 ) Production depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 0.70 $ 0.62 12.9 $ 0.59 5.1 Gathering: Gathered volumes (MMcfe) 94,210 108,592 (13.2 ) 121,044 (10.3 ) Average gathering fee ($/Mcfe) $ 1.14 $ 1.02 11.8 $ 0.82 24.4 Gathering and compression expense ($/Mcfe) $ 0.49 $ 0.42 16.7 $ 0.31 35.5 Gathering and compression depreciation ($/Mcfe) $ 0.17 $ 0.14 21.4 $ 0.12 16.7 (in thousands) Production operating income $ 231,417 $ 231,849 (0.2 ) $ 260,931 (11.1 ) Gathering operating income 32,128 37,315 (13.9 ) 32,650 14.3 Total operating income $ 263,545 $ 269,164 (2.1 ) $ 293,581 (8.3 ) Production depletion $ 58,264 $ 50,330 15.8 $ 46,750 7.7 Gathering and compression depreciation 15,693 15,411 1.8 14,312 7.7 Other DD&A 5,903 4,759 24.0 3,835 24.1 Total DD&A $ 79,860 $ 70,500 13.3 $ 64,897 8.6 Capital expenditures (thousands) (b) $ 715,722 $ 335,948 113.0 $ 264,095 27.2 26 Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % change 2007 2006 2005 % change 2006 2005 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Production revenues $ 394,583 $ 377,626 4.5 $ 390,290 (3.2 ) Gathering revenues (c) 107,092 110,945 (3.5 ) 98,901 12.2 Total operating revenues 501,675 488,571 2.7 489,191 (0.1 ) Operating expenses: LOE, excluding production taxes 25,361 23,818 6.5 22,427 6.2 Production taxes (d) 36,912 38,653 (4.5 ) 38,288 1.0 Exploration expense 862 802 7.5 768 4.4 Gathering and compression (O&M) 45,844 45,860 38,101 20.4 SG&A 49,291 39,774 23.9 30,610 29.9 Impairment charges 519 (100.0 ) DD&A 79,860 70,500 13.3 64,897 8.6 Total operating expenses 238,130 219,407 8.5 195,610 12.2 Operating income $ 263,545 $ 269,164 (2.1 ) $ 293,581 (8.3 ) Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ 2,949 $ 129 2,186 $ 493 (73.8 ) Other income $ 6,467 $ 800 708 $ (a) Natural gas and oil production represents the Companys interest in gas and oil production measured at the well head.

(d) Production taxes include severance and production related ad valorem and other property taxes. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007 vs. December 31, 2006 Equitable Supplys operating income totaled $263.5 million for 2007 compared to $269.2 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $5.6 million between years. Gathering operating income decreased $5.2 million due to a decrease in gathered volumes, partially offset by an increase in the average gathering fee. Production operating income decreased $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in production operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in average well head sales price and increased sales volumes. Total operating revenues were $501.7 million for 2007 compared to $488.6 million for 2006. The $13.1 million increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to a 3% increase in the average well head sales price and a 1% increase in production total sales volumes, partially offset by a 4% decrease in gathering revenues. The $0.15 per Mcfe increase in the average well head sales price was mainly attributable to a higher percentage of 27 unhedged gas sales, a higher realized hedge price and a higher liquids price. The 1% increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the 2007 and 2006 drilling programs, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells and the 2007 sale to PMOG of interests which provided sales of 3,044 MMcfe during 2006. The 4% decrease in gathering revenues was attributable to a 13% decline in gathered volumes, partially offset by a 12% increase in the average gathering fee. The decrease in gathered volumes is primarily the result of a reduction in volumes gathered for Company production due to the contribution of gathering facilities and pipelines to Nora Gathering, LLC, partially offset by increased Company production. The increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to ensuring that this fee is sufficient to cover increasing operating costs. Operating expenses totaled $238.1 million for 2007 compared to $219.4 million for 2006. The $18.7 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $9.5 million in SG&A, $9.4 million in DD&A and $1.5 million in LOE, excluding production taxes, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in production taxes. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to increased legal reserves, settlements and related expenses in 2007 compared to the reduction of certain liability reserves in 2006, partially offset by a 2006 increase to the reserve established for uncollectible accounts. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate ($6.9 million) and volume ($1.0 million), as well as increased depreciation on a higher asset base ($1.5 million). The $0.08 increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The increase in LOE, excluding production taxes, was attributable to personnel costs, environmental costs and liability insurance costs. The decrease in production taxes was primarily due to a decrease in severance taxes arising out of the sale of assets in the Nora area. Gathering and compression expense remained flat year over year as increased expense in 2007 for the Companys remaining gathering facilities was mostly offset by decreased expenses relating to the gathering asset contribution to Nora Gathering LLC and a $3.3 million pension and other postretirement benefits charge for an early retirement program in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increased gathering and compression expense at the remaining facilities was primarily due to increased electricity charges on newly installed electric compressors, increased field line and compressor maintenance related to the Companys infrastructure investments, increased field labor and related employment costs and increased compliance costs. The per unit gathering and compression rate increased as the per unit rate for the Nora area properties contributed in 2007 was significantly lower than the rate for the Companys remaining properties. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled $2.9 million for 2007 compared to equity earnings of $0.1 million for 2006. The $2.8 million increase was primarily due to equity earnings of $2.6 million recorded in 2007 for Equitable Supplys investment in Nora Gathering, LLC. Other income represents AFUDC Equity for the construction of the FERC regulated Big Sandy Pipeline. The $5.7 million increase from 2006 to 2007 is the result of increased capital spending for this infrastructure project. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. December 31, 2005 Equitable Supplys operating income totaled $269.2 million for 2006 compared to $293.6 million for 2005, a decrease of $24.4 million between years. Production operating income decreased $29.1 million primarily due to a decrease in well head sales price and an increase in production operating expenses, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Gathering operating income increased $4.7 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses. Total operating revenues were $488.6 million for 2006 compared to $489.2 million for 2005. The $0.6 million decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a 7% per Mcfe decrease in the average well head sales price, partially offset by a 3% increase in production total sales volumes and a 12% increase in gathering revenues. The $0.34 per Mcfe decrease in the average well head sales price was mainly attributable to decreased market prices on unhedged volumes and increased gathering charges, partially offset by the absence of a 2005 negative price adjustment and increased prices on hedged volumes. The 2005 price adjustment was principally due to the Companys conclusion that the well head sales price allocated to a third partys working interest gas in previous periods may have been lower than the Company was obligated to pay. The 3% increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the 2006 and 2005 drilling programs, partially offset by the sale of certain non core gas properties in 2005 and the normal production decline in the Companys wells. The 12% increase in 28 gathering revenues was attributable to a 24% increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by a 10% decline in gathered volumes. The increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program, along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases. The average gathering fee was also positively impacted by the transfer of certain regulated gathering facilities to Equitable Utilities. The decrease in gathered volumes in 2006 was primarily due to this transfer, the sale of gathering assets in 2005 and third party customer volume shut ins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines. These factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for Company production in 2006. Operating expenses totaled $219.4 million for 2006 compared to $195.6 million for 2005. The $23.8 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $9.2 million in SG&A, $7.8 million in gathering and compression, $5.6 million in DD&A, $1.4 million in LOE, excluding production taxes, and $0.4 million in production taxes. The increase in SG&A was the result of reserves established in connection with certain legal disputes and bad debt expenses. The increase in gathering and compression was primarily due to the $3.3 million pension and other postretirement benefits charges, increased compressor station operation and repair costs, including electricity on newly installed compressors, increased property taxes and increased field labor and related employment costs. These factors were partially offset by the transfer of gathering facilities to Equitable Utilities and the sale of gathering assets in 2005. The increase in DD&A was due to a $0.03 per Mcf increase in the unit depletion rate ($2.0 million), increased depreciation on a higher asset base ($2.0 million) and increased produced volumes ($1.6 million). The increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base. The increase in LOE, excluding production taxes, was primarily due to increased direct well expenses and well and location repairs and maintenance, partially offset by the sale of gas properties in 2005. The increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes ($2.4 million), partially offset by decreased severance taxes ($2.0 million). The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years, as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the Companys wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The decrease in severance taxes (a production tax directly imposed on the value of gas extracted) was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes. The impairment charges in 2005 were related to the Companys relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations to its new consolidated office space. See Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of Equitable Supplys capital expenditures during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Outlook Equitable Supplys business strategy is focused on organic growth of the Companys natural gas reserves. The most significant challenge facing the Company and other producers in the Appalachian Basin is the availability of the pipeline infrastructure required to transport produced natural gas from the well to market. As the Company continues to expand the development of its reserves, primarily through horizontal drilling, the need for such infrastructure is increasingly important. Key elements of Equitable Supplys strategy include: Expanding reserves and production through horizontal drilling in Kentucky and West Virginia. The Companys capital commitments budget for 2008 includes $536 million for well development. Through this capital program the Company will seek to maximize the value of its existing asset base by developing its large acreage position, which the Company believes holds significant production and reserve growth potential. A substantial portion of the Companys 2008 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in Kentucky and West Virginia. Exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays. In 2008, the Company will examine the potential for exploitation of gas reserves in new geological formations and through different technologies. Plans include re entry wells in the Devonian shale, testing the Devonian shale in Virginia, and high and low pressure Marcellus shale wells. In addition, the Company will obtain proprietary seismic data in order to evaluate deep drilling opportunities for 2009. Approximately 15% of wells drilled in 2008 are expected to be located in these emerging development plays in the Appalachian Basin. 29 Investing in midstream transportation, gathering and processing in the Appalachian Basin. The Companys investment in midstream infrastructure is focused on its transportation, gathering and processing capacity including completion of the Big Sandy Pipeline and the Langley processing facility. Infrastructure investment will help mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the Companys gathering systems in transporting gas to market. The Company has adopted a pipe driven business model whereby production growth will occur in conjunction with the completion of a series of pipeline and compression projects known as corridors. A corridor will represent a large area of acreage typically inclusive of a thousand or more well sites that requires investment in new pipeline and compression. Each corridor will radiate out from a central processing facility, such as the Companys Langley facility, which will then connect to larger pipes, such as the Big Sandy Pipeline, that transport gas to interstate markets. Equitable Utilities Overview Equitable Utilities net operating revenues increased 4% from 2006 to 2007. This increase was primarily due to favorable storage asset optimization at energy marketing and colder weather in Equitable Gass service territory in 2007, partially offset by a reduction in the pipeline operations net revenues due to a favorable adjustment in 2006 for the settlement of the Equitrans rate case. The marketing business is primarily driven by the optimization of the Companys physical and contractual gas storage assets which allow the segment to purchase gas and store it in lower price markets and simultaneously enter into contracts to sell it later at higher prices, taking advantage of near term seasonal gas price spreads. Those spreads are unpredictable and at times were wider for transactions settled in 2007 than they were for contracts which settled in 2006. Increases in net operating revenues were offset by increases in total operating expenses in 2007 of $22.0 million, or 15%, primarily due to the write off of Peoples and Hope acquisition related costs that were previously deferred, higher corporate allocations, and increased compensation expense. The weather in Equitable Gas service territory in 2007 was 7% colder than 2006 but 9% warmer than the 30 year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) average for the Companys service territory. The weather in 2006 was 15% warmer than the 30 year average. Pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist low income customers with paying their gas bills. The costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers. Equitable Gas has several such programs including the CAP. In October 2006, Equitable Gas submitted a request for PA PUC approval to increase funding to support the increasing costs of its CAP. On September 27, 2007, the PA PUC issued an order approving an increase to Equitables surcharge, which is designed to offset the costs of CAP. The revised surcharge went into effect on October 2, 2007. On April 5, 2006, Equitrans entered into a settlement with the FERC that allows Equitrans to institute an annual surcharge for the tracking and recovery of all costs (operations, maintenance and return on invested capital) incurred on and after September 1, 2005, related to Equitrans Pipeline Safety Program under the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. Filings to modify the surcharge must be made on or before March 1st of each year for approval by the FERC. On March 29, 2007, the Company received approval, subject to refund, to institute the surcharge, and on April 1, 2007, the Company commenced billing the surcharge. On November 26, 2007, the FERC removed the refund condition and approved the surcharge effective April 1, 2007. As a result of the FERC order, in 2007 Equitrans recognized $1.2 million in deferred revenue as well as $0.7 million in pipeline integrity and safety maintenance costs that were deferred pending receipt of the final FERC order. The Company anticipates that additional filings to modify the surcharge will continue to be made in future years to recover costs incurred in connection with its Pipeline Safety Program. On March 1, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Dominions natural gas distribution assets in Pennsylvania and in West Virginia for approximately $970 million, subject to adjustments, in a cash transaction for the stock of Peoples and Hope. In light of the continued delay in achieving the final legal approvals for this transaction, the Company and Dominion agreed to terminate the definitive agreement 30 pursuant to a mutual termination agreement entered into on January 15, 2008. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized a charge of $10.1 million for acquisition costs that were previously deferred. Proceedings were initiated by the Federal Trade Commission for the purpose of challenging the Companys proposed acquisition of Peoples.

An increase in net operating revenues was more than offset by increased operating expenses. Increased operating expenses were primarily related to the fourth quarter of 2007 write off of deferred acquisition costs that resulted from the termination of the agreement to acquire Peoples and Hope. The 2007 operating income was also lower due to the following 2006 favorable non recurring items: settlement of the Equitrans rate case for the pipeline operations and a gain from the partial reversal of a 2005 impairment charge in connection with the Companys office consolidation. Net operating revenues were $285.3 million for 2007 compared to $275.0 million for 2006. The $10.3 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased energy marketing net operating revenues and increased distribution residential net operating revenues, partially offset by a reduction in pipeline net operating revenues. The $8.9 million increase in marketing net operating revenues was a result of storage asset optimization realized as the energy marketing operations used contractual storage capacity to capture unusually high summer to winter price spreads. These price spreads were captured at a time of high volatility and the transactions settled in 2007. Distribution net operating revenues increased by $6.5 million as a result of weather that was 7% colder than the prior year resulting in a 2,480 MMcf increase in residential sales and transportation volumes from 2006 to 2007. Commercial and industrial volumes increased 2,130 MMcf from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to an increase in usage by one industrial customer. These high volume industrial sales have very low margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. The pipeline net operating revenues declined by $5.1 million in 2007, primarily attributable to a one time positive effect of the Equitrans rate case settlement of $7.0 million in 2006. This reduction in net operating revenues was partially offset by Equitrans Pipeline Safety surcharge that was formally approved by the FERC in November 2007 and increased firm transportation activities year over year. 32 Operating expenses totaled $171.8 million for 2007 compared to $149.8 million for 2006. Operating expenses for 2007 included a $10.1 million write off of costs previously deferred related to the now terminated agreement to acquire Peoples and Hope, while 2006 included a one time benefit of $2.4 million from the partial reversal of the 2005 impairment charge. Other increases in SG&A expense included higher corporate overhead allocations, higher incentive compensation costs, increased labor costs including information technology enhancements and costs associated with a customer experience study of the Equitable Gas customers. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense as a result of the continued organizational focus on collections and a reduction in delinquent accounts receivable and net write offs. O&M expense increased $2.9 million as a result of increased maintenance activities and fleet related costs at the distribution and pipeline operations. The 2007 pipeline O&M expense also included the recognition of $0.9 million of pipeline safety costs that were deferred pending the FERC order on the Equitrans Pipeline Safety surcharge. Other income represents AFUDC Equity and the increase over 2006 is primarily a result of increased capital spending on pipeline safety and integrity projects. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. December 31, 2005 Equitable Utilities operating income totaled $125.2 million for 2006 compared to $98.3 million for 2005. Equitable Utilities operating income increased $26.9 million primarily due to increased net marketing revenues, lower expenses related to defined benefit pension plans, increased pipeline operating income, reduction in bad debt expense, an impairment charge in 2005 in connection with the Companys office consolidation and a gain in 2006 as a result of the partial reversal of the 2005 office impairment charge. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of transition planning costs incurred for the now terminated agreement to acquire Peoples and Hope and a reduction in distribution net operating revenues due to weather 15% warmer than the 30 year average. Net operating revenues were $275.0 million for 2006 compared to $253.4 million for 2005. The $21.6 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased pipeline and marketing net operating revenues, partially offset by lower distribution net operating revenues. Pipeline operations net operating revenues increased $18.8 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the settlement of Equitrans 2004 and 2005 FERC rate case and the implementation of new rates and contracts in connection with that settlement. The settlements approval, which occurred in April 2006, improved net operating revenues by $7.0 million related to years 2005 and prior; in addition, new contract rates and billing determinants in the settlement resulted in a $6.1 million increase. The transfer of certain gathering assets from Equitable Supply resulted in the remaining $5.7 million increase. The increase in marketing net operating revenues of $16.4 million resulted primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in the volatile natural gas commodity price environment. Distribution operations net operating revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to a 3,666 MMcf decrease in residential sales and transportation volumes resulting from warmer weather. Operating expenses totaled $149.8 million for 2006 compared to $155.1 million for 2005. Operating expenses for 2005 included $16.0 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a $3.8 million loss related to the office impairment in connection with the Companys relocation into its new, consolidated office space. Operating expenses for 2006 include $12.3 million of transition planning costs incurred for the now terminated agreement to acquire Peoples and Hope; a $2.9 million increase in gathering expenses as a result of the transfer of certain assets from Equitable Supply; the recognition of $4.6 million of previously deferred post retirement benefit obligation expenses in the pipeline business in connection with the FERC rate case settlement; and the reversal of $2.4 million of the 2005 office impairment charge. Excluding these items, operating expenses decreased $2.9 million, which was primarily a result of decreases in distribution and marketing bad debt expense totaling $5.2 million, offset by increases of $0.9 million in depreciation expense and $0.8 million in general liability insurance expenses. The improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of non paying customers, improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process. The increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in Equitable Utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software, distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices. 33 See Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of Equitable Utilities capital expenditures during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Outlook Equitable Utilities business strategy is focused on efficiently and effectively operating the Companys assets to optimize its return. Key elements of Equitable Utilities strategy include: Enhancing the value of the regulated utility operations. Equitable Utilities will seek to enhance the value of its existing distribution assets by establishing a reputation for excellent customer service; effectively managing its capital spending; improving the efficiency of its work force through superior work management; and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations. Equitable Utilities is currently evaluating a base rate case filing for the Pennsylvania distribution business in order to improve returns through regulatory arrangements that fairly balance the interests of customers and shareholders. Growth and expansion of storage, gathering and commercial operations. Equitable Utilities plans to continue to provide disciplined incremental earnings growth through its storage, gathering and commercial operations, including expanding these assets where there are additional opportunities to provide economical storage services in the Companys operating regions. Expansion of market footprint. As Equitable grows its Appalachian production base, the Company is exploring opportunities to expand its market footprint in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic gas sales markets. To this end, the Company has previously announced its intent to participate with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in the development of the Northeast Passage Project. In addition, the Company continues discussions with other interstate pipelines in the growing Mid Atlantic and Southeast markets. Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Thousands) Gain on sale of assets, net $ 126,088 $ $ Gain on sale of available for sale securities, net 1,042 110,280 Other income 7,645 1,442 1,539 Income from discontinued operations 4,261 1,481 During 2007, the Equitable Supply segment sold to Pine Mountain Oil and Gas, Inc. (PMOG) a portion of the Companys interests in certain gas properties in the Nora area totaling approximately 74 Bcf of proved reserves. Also during 2007, the Equitable Supply segment contributed certain Nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to Nora Gathering, LLC in exchange for a 50% equity interest in Nora Gathering, LLC and cash. These transactions resulted in a net gain of $126.1 million. See Note 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. As discussed in Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2007 the Company reviewed its investment portfolio (including its investment allocation) and sold equity funds with a cost basis of $6.3 million for total proceeds of $7.3 million, resulting in the Company recognizing a gain of $1.0 million. During 2005, the Company sold its remaining 7.0 million Kerr McGee shares, resulting in pre tax gains net of collar termination costs totaling $110.3 million. In 2007 and 2006, other income primarily relates to the equity portion of AFUDC. Prior to 2007, the amount of AFUDC Equity was not significant and was included as an offset to interest expense in the Statements of Consolidated Income. As a result of the significance of the carrying costs related to the Big Sandy Pipeline and other regulated projects, AFUDC Equity has been reclassified to other income in the Statements of Consolidated Income for all periods presented. Other income in 2005 includes pre tax dividend income of $1.2 million relating to the Kerr McGee shares held by the Company in that year. 34 The Companys NORESCO business is classified as discontinued operations due to the sale of the NORESCO domestic business in 2005 and sale of the Companys remaining international investment in early 2006. Income from discontinued operations for 2006 included a tax benefit of $3.2 million due to a reduced tax liability on the sale of the domestic business and after tax income of $1.1 million resulting from the Companys reassessment of its remaining obligations for costs incurred related to the sale of the domestic business. Income from discontinued operations for 2005 included the reversal of approximately $7.8 million of reserves (after tax) established in 2004, due to improved business conditions in the related international markets, as well as a $6.4 million tax benefit from the reorganization of the Companys international assets in 2005. These 2005 income items were partially offset by $18.7 million in after tax charges recorded in 2005, related to the recording of $13.7 million of income taxes on the sale and other costs incurred as a result of the sale of the domestic NORESCO business. Interest Expense 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ 47,669 $ 48,494 $ 44,781 Interest expense decreased by $0.8 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of the repayment of long term debt. A 1.2% increase in the average annual short term interest rate was more than offset by an overall reduction in weighted average net short term debt outstanding, in part due to the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year. Interest expense increased by $3.7 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to a full year of interest expense in 2006 from the issuance of $150 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5% on September 30, 2005 and an increase in the average annual short term debt interest rate, partially offset by lower average short term debt during 2006. Average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 5.8%, 4.6% and 3.5% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $426.7 million for 2007 as compared to $617.8 million for 2006, a net decrease of $191.1 million in cash flows provided by operating activities between years. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following: a $5.9 million increase in cash required for margin deposits on the Companys natural gas hedge agreements in 2007 compared to a $317.8 million decrease in cash required for margin deposits in 2006. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to significantly higher than normal gas prices in 2005 which resulted in increased deposit remittances in that year; a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.5 million in 2007 compared to a decrease in accounts receivable of $63.5 million in 2006. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005; partially offset by: an increase in other current liabilities of $99.4 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of $31.9 million in 2006, primarily related to long term incentive compensation plans and the timing of payments; an increase in accounts payable of $65.9 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of $29.3 million in 2006. The increase in accounts payable in 2007 was primarily the result of increased capital spending, while the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006. 35 Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $617.8 million for 2006 as compared to $312.3 million of cash flows used in operating activities for 2005, a net increase of $930.1 in cash flows provided by operating activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following: a $598.7 million net reduction in cash required for margin deposit requirements on the Companys natural gas hedge agreements, primarily due to significantly higher than normal gas prices in 2005 which resulted in increased deposit remittances in that year; a decrease in tax payments to $58.6 million in 2006 from $251.5 million in 2005, primarily due to taxes paid in 2005 related to the sale of the Companys Kerr McGee shares, the sale of the NORESCO discontinued operations and the sale of non core gas properties for significant taxable gains, all in 2005; a decrease in accounts receivable of $63.5 million in 2006 compared to an increase of $78.0 million in 2005, primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005; a decrease in inventory of $20.8 million during 2006 as compared to an increase of $85.3 million in 2005, primarily due to higher natural gas prices on volumes stored in 2005 compared to 2006; partially offset by: a decrease in accounts payable of $29.3 million in 2006 compared to an increase of $71.5 million in 2005, primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005; a $31.9 million reduction in other current liabilities during 2006, as significant amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2005 for which payment was remitted shortly after the 2005 year end. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $590.1 million for 2007 as compared to $406.3 million for 2006, a net increase of $183.8 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following: an increase in capital expenditures to $776.7 million in 2007 from $403.1 million in 2006. See discussion of capital expenditures below; an increase of $28.1 million in 2007 from the Companys purchase of an additional working interest of approximately 13.5% in the Roaring Fork area in Virginia; partially offset by: proceeds received in the second quarter of 2007 from the sale and contribution of assets. See Note 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $406.3 million for 2006 as compared to $348.1 million of cash flows provided by investing activities for 2005, a net increase of $754.4 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following: net proceeds of $460.5 million received from the sale of approximately 7.0 million shares of Kerr McGee Corporation common stock in 2005; 36 proceeds of $142.0 million from the sale of certain non core gas properties and associated gathering assets in 2005; an increase in capital expenditures to $403.1 million in 2006 from $275.5 million in 2005. See discussion of capital expenditures below; proceeds of $80.0 million from the sale of the domestic operations of the Companys NORESCO business segment in 2005; partially offset by: the Companys acquisition of the 99% limited partnership interest in ESP for $57.5 million in 2005. Capital Commitments and Expenditures The Company forecasts approximately $1.2 billion of capital commitments for 2008. This forecast includes $536 million for well development, $568 million for midstream infrastructure at Equitable Supply, $80 million for midstream projects at Equitable Utilities and $37 million for distribution infrastructure projects. Over 50% of the capital commitments in 2008 are for drilling and infrastructure in Kentucky. A portion of these capital commitments is not expected to impact cash flow until 2009 and beyond. Capital Expenditures 2008 Forecast 2007 Actual 2006 Actual 2005 Actual Well development (primarily drilling) $ 619 million $ 298 million $ 200 million $ 131 million Equitable Supply infrastructure $ 490 million $ 390 million $ 136 million $ 75 million Equitable Utilities $ 107 million $ 88 million $ 64 million $ 61 million Acquisitions and other $ 5 million $ 29 million ** $ 3 million $ 66 million *** Total $ 1,221 million * $ 805 million $ 403 million $ 333 million * The forecasted 2008 capital expenditures include 2007 capital commitments totaling $422 million, including $234 million for Equitable Supply infrastructure, $155 million for well development, and $33 million for Equitable Utilities. ** Includes $28.1 million related to the Companys purchase of an additional working interest of approximately 13.5% in the Roaring Fork area in Virginia and certain gathering assets from a minority interest holder. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. *** Includes $57.5 million for the acquisition of the 99% limited partnership interest in Eastern Seven Partners, L.P. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures for well development and Equitable Supply infrastructure increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increased drilling and development program in 2007, capital expended for construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline, upgrades to the Langley plant and other throughput optimization projects. Capital expenditures for well development and Equitable Supply infrastructure increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increased drilling and development program in 2006, capital expended for construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline and other throughput optimization projects. 37 Capital expenditures for Equitable Utilities increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased transmission pipeline replacement associated with pipeline integrity under The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and increased gathering infrastructure expenditures. These same projects caused capital expenditures for Equitable Utilities to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005. The Companys forecasted 2008 capital expenditures represent a significant increase over capital expenditures in 2007. The $619 million targeted for well development in 2008 represents a $321 million increase over 2007 which is driven by expected increased drilling activity of up to 750 wells in 2008 compared to 634 wells in 2007. The ultimate number of wells drilled will depend on the mix of horizontal shale wells, vertical conventional wells in sandstone and shale, and coal bed methane wells. The Company plans to drill between 250 and 300 horizontal wells in 2008, with the intent to drill more if efficiency improvements experienced in 2007 continue. The $490 million forecast for 2008 Equitable Supply infrastructure includes incremental Appalachian midstream infrastructure to move new gas volumes to market, including approximately 60,000 horsepower of compression and approximately 400 miles of gathering lines. The $107 million forecasted for Equitable Utilities includes $70 million for midstream projects and $37 million for distribution infrastructure projects. The midstream projects include amounts for gathering growth and infrastructure improvements. The distribution infrastructure projects primarily include transmission pipeline replacement. The Company expects to finance its capital expenditures with cash generated from operations, short term debt and capital market transactions completed during 2008. See discussion in the Financing Activities section below regarding the financing capacity of the Company. For federal income tax purposes the Company typically deducts as intangible drilling costs (IDC) approximately 70% of its vertical drilling costs and 75% of its horizontal drilling costs in the year incurred. The Company expects that the IDC deduction resulting from its increased drilling program coupled with accelerated tax depreciation for expansion of the gathering infrastructure will most likely put the Company into an overall federal tax net operating loss position in 2008 which is likely to continue as long as expansion in Appalachia continues. The result of this change is that the Company expects minimal cash taxes for the foreseeable future. Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $245.1 million for 2007 as compared to $286.5 million of cash flows used in financing activities for 2006, a net increase of $531.6 million in cash flows provided by financing activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable largely to the following: a $314.0 million increase in amounts borrowed under short term loans in 2007 compared to a $229.3 million decrease in short term borrowings in 2006. The increase in short term borrowings in 2007 was for the purposes of funding capital expenditures and working capital requirements; Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $286.5 million for 2006 as compared to $39.2 million of cash flows provided by financing activities for 2005, a net increase of $325.7 million in cash flows used in financing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in financing activities was attributable largely to the following: a $229.3 million decrease in amounts borrowed under short term loans in 2006 compared to a $69.8 million increase in short term borrowings in 2005. The decrease in short term borrowings in 2006 was primarily the result of decreased requirements for funding margin deposits as previously discussed; proceeds in 2005 from the September 2005 issuance of $150.0 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5% and a maturity date of October 1, 2015; partially offset by: 38 no repurchases of shares of the Companys outstanding common stock under the Companys share repurchase program during 2006 in anticipation of the now terminated agreement to acquire Peoples and Hope, compared to repurchases of $122.3 million of common stock in 2005. The Company is committed to maintaining a cost effective capital structure and intends to finance future cash requirements, including the portion of the 2008 capital expenditure forecast not financed by cash flows from operations, using capital market transactions Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. The Companys $1.5 billion, five year revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other purposes including support of the Companys commercial paper program. Historically, short term borrowings have been used mainly to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the summer months and were generally repaid as natural gas was sold during the heating season. Due to the volatility in the short term debt markets during the second half of 2007, the Company determined that its lowest cost of short term borrowings would be obtained by borrowing directly under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. The Company will continue to evaluate whether the commercial paper markets or direct loans under the revolving credit facility offer the lowest cost of short term debt capital, and will obtain short term funding to meet its liquidity needs from either source as needed. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding short term loans under the revolving credit facility of $450.0 million and no commercial paper balances. Interest rates on short term borrowings averaged 5.8% during 2007. The Companys short term borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less. Security Ratings and Financing Triggers The table below reflects the credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the Company as of February 9, 2008. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Companys cost of short term and long term debt and its access to the credit markets. Rating Service Unsecured Medium Term Notes Commercial Paper Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB A 2 On January 15, 2008, Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) lowered its corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings on Equitable Resources, Inc. to BBB from A and removed the Company from CreditWatch. S&P had put Equitable on CreditWatch with negative implications on March 2, 2006 because of the possibility that the Company would finance its purchase of Peoples and Hope largely with debt. Following Equitables announcement of the termination of the purchase agreement, S&P removed the Company from CreditWatch and lowered its ratings, with a negative outlook. In its publication regarding the downgrade, S&P stated that Equitable has been rapidly expanding its gas exploration and production and gas gathering activities in the Appalachian region and the negative outlook reflects the increasing influence of Equitables exploration and production operations over the entire Company. On October 31, 2007, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) completed its review of the Companys credit rating and downgraded Equitables ratings to Baa1 for senior unsecured long term debt and Prime 2 for commercial paper. Moodys stated that its rating reflects the Companys increased tolerance for business and financial risk as the Company adopts a more growth oriented strategy. Moodys did not take any further ratings action following the Companys announcement of the termination of the Peoples and Hope purchase agreement. 39 The Companys credit ratings may be subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the credit rating agencies downgrade the Companys ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit the Companys access to the commercial paper market and borrowing costs would increase. In addition, the Company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, incur increased margin deposit requirements with respect to its hedging instruments, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease. For example, the Company was required to post cash margin deposits of approximately $100 million as of January 31, 2008. Had the Companys ratings not been downgraded, the cash margin deposit required on January 31, 2008 would have been less than $5 million. The margin amount can change as a result of gas prices, as well as credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. The Companys credit ratings on its non credit enhanced, senior unsecured long term debt determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit; the lower the Companys credit rating, the higher the level of fees and interest rate. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $450.0 million of borrowings against these lines of credit. The Company also pays facility fees to maintain credit availability. As a result of the S&P credit rating downgrade, the Companys annualized facility fees changed from approximately $1.0 million to $1.5 million. The Companys debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. The most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations, and change of control provisions. The Companys current credit facilitys financial covenants require a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2007, the Company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. Commodity Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Companys risk management program includes the use of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts and options and OTC natural gas swap agreements and options (collectively, derivative commodity instruments) to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes. The preponderance of derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are fixed price swaps or collars. As a result, the approximate volumes and prices of the Companys total hedge position for 2008 through 2010 are: 2008 2009 2010 Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 50 37 35 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 4.62 $ 5.91 $ 5.96 Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 10 10 10 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 7.61 $ 7.61 $ 7.61 Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 11.27 $ 11.27 $ 11.27 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf 40 The Companys current hedged position provides price protection for a substantial portion of expected equity production for 2008 and a significant portion of expected equity production for the years 2009 through 2013. The Companys exposure to a $0.10 change in average NYMEX natural gas price is approximately $0.01 per diluted share for 2008 and ranges from $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share per year for 2009 and 2010. The Company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices. See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A and Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Items Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic business in 2005, the Company agreed to maintain certain guarantees which benefit NORESCO. These guarantees, the majority of which predate the sale of NORESCO, became off balance sheet arrangements upon the closing of the sale of NORESCO. These arrangements include guarantees of NORESCOs obligations to the purchasers of certain of NORESCOs contract receivables and agreements to maintain guarantees supporting NORESCOs obligations under certain customer contracts. In addition, NORESCO and the purchaser agreed that NORESCO would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and that the purchaser or NORESCO would reimburse the Company for losses under the guarantees. The purchasers obligations to reimburse the Company are capped at $6 million. The total maximum potential obligation under these arrangements is estimated to be approximately $388 million as of December 31, 2007, and decreases over time as the guarantees expire or the underlying obligations are fulfilled by NORESCO. The Company determined that the likelihood the Company will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote, and as such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees. In November 1995, Equitable, through a subsidiary, guaranteed a tax indemnification to the limited partners of Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP) for any potential tax losses resulting from a disallowance of the nonconventional fuels tax credits, if certain representations and warranties of the Company were not true. The Company guaranteed the tax indemnification until the tax statute of limitations closes. The Company does not have any recourse provisions with third parties or any collateral held by third parties associated with this guarantee that could be liquidated to recover amounts paid, if any, under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2007, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is estimated to be approximately $46 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45, and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. Additionally, based on the status of the Companys IRS examinations, the Company has determined that any potential loss from this guarantee is remote. The Company has a non equity interest in a variable interest entity, Appalachian NPI, LLC (ANPI), in which Equitable was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2007, ANPI had $200 million of total assets and $333 million of total liabilities (including $120 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. The Company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to ANPI, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the projects future cash flows from the preceding year end until the termination date of the agreement. This liquidity reserve guarantee is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT). The Company received a market based fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2007, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately $20 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. As noted above, on January 15, 2008, S&P lowered the Companys corporate credit and senior unsecured rating to BBB. As a result of this downgrade, the terms of this guarantee require the Company to provide a letter of credit in favor of ANPI as security for its obligations under the liquidity reserve guarantee. The amount of this letter of credit requirement is approximately $26.4 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee. 41 The Company has entered into an agreement with ANGT to provide gathering and operating services to deliver ANGTs gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $15.8 million, $16.8 million and $15.5 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys guarantees. Pension Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which required an employer to recognize a benefit plans funded status in its statement of financial position, measure a benefit plans assets and obligations as of the end of the employers fiscal year and recognize the changes in the benefit plans funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2007, 2006 and 2005, excluding special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses, totaled $0.6 million, $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The Company recognized special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2007, 2006 and 2005 of $1.4 million, $3.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively. During 2007, the Company recognized a settlement expense of $0.5 million due to a plan design change for a specific union and an additional settlement expense for $0.5 million due to the transfer of some current active employees to non union employment. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a settlement expense of approximately $2.7 million for an early retirement program. During 2005, the Company settled its pension obligation with the USW, Local Union 12050 representing 182 employees. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized a settlement expense of $12.1 million during 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company settled its pension obligation with certain non represented employees. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized a settlement expense of approximately $2.4 million in 2005. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $1.3 million, $1.8 million and $20.4 million to its pension plan during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of the previously described settlements. The Company expects to make cash contributions of less than $0.1 million to its pension plan during 2008. Incentive Compensation The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, which results in the Company recognizing compensation cost for all forms of share based payments to employees, including employee stock options, in its financial statements. The Companys estimate of compensation cost for stock options is based on the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes model is considered a theoretical or probability model used to estimate the price an option would sell for in the market today. The Company does not represent that this method yields an exact value of what an unrelated third party (i.e., the market) would be willing to pay to acquire such options. The Companys recent compensation practices have focused primarily on the issuance of performance based units and time restricted stock awards for which it recognizes compensation expense over the applicable vesting periods. Management and the Board of Directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach closely aligns managements incentives with shareholder rewards. No new stock options were awarded in 2007; all stock options granted subsequent to 2003 have comprised options granted for reload rights associated with previously awarded options. The Company recorded approximately $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of compensation expense related to stock options in 2007 and 2006, the majority of which related to stock option reloads which immediately vested under the terms of the related stock option award agreements. The majority of the Companys previously 42 issued stock options were already vested at the time of adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and associated compensation expense yet to be recognized was insignificant. All stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2007 are fully vested. Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for prior periods stock option grants consistent with the methodology prescribed in SFAS No. 123R, net income would have been reduced by an estimated $1.5 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, for 2005. The Company recorded the following incentive compensation cost, including amounts both expensed and capitalized, in its financial statements for the periods indicated below: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (millions) Short term incentive compensation $ 22.9 $ 16.7 $ 12.9 Long term incentive compensation 70.0 26.6 46.4 Total incentive compensation $ 92.9 $ 43.3 $ 59.3 The long term incentive compensation is primarily associated with Executive Performance Incentive Programs (the Programs) that were instituted starting in 2002. The vesting of the awards granted under the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2005 Program) will occur contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a fixed group of peer companies and the Companys average absolute return on total capital, during the four year performance period ending December 31, 2008. Payment of awards is expected to be made in cash and stock based on the price of the Companys common stock at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2008. The Company accounts for these awards as liability awards and as such records compensation expense for the remeasurement of the fair value of the awards. In 2007, the Company increased its assumptions for both the payout multiple and ultimate share price at the vesting date (December 31, 2008) based on a review of the Companys performance relative to its peer group under the 2005 Program as well as the significant appreciation in the Companys stock price during the period. As a result, the Company recognized an additional $42.4 million of long term incentive expenses associated with the 2005 Program in 2007. The increase in incentive compensation recorded under the Companys short term incentive plan of $6.2 million from 2006 to 2007 includes an increase of approximately $3.7 million in expensed short term incentive costs and an increase of approximately $2.5 million in capitalized short term incentive costs. The increase in short term incentive compensation was primarily due to favorable asset optimization results realized by Equitable Utilities marketing group, the favorable results of Equitable Supplys horizontal drilling program and an overall increase in employee headcount in 2007. Long term incentive compensation during 2006 was lower than during 2005 due to a greater number of unvested units outstanding under the Programs during 2005 than during 2006, as two Programs were in effect during 2005 and only one during 2006. The Company currently forecasts fiscal year 2008 total incentive compensation cost under existing plans of approximately $59 million, including expense of $36 million for the 2005 Program. The 2005 Program terminates on December 31, 2008. The Compensation Committee is currently developing a successor long term incentive compensation program. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations and pipeline operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed. Accounting for the Companys regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 71. As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. 43 Schedule of Contractual Obligations The following table details the future projected payments associated with the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013+ (Thousands) Long term debt $ 753,500 $ $ 4,300 $ 206,000 $ 543,200 Interest payments 453,042 44,317 88,148 86,054 234,523 Purchase obligations 191,140 39,111 70,378 57,109 24,542 Other liabilities 154,592 142,788 11,804 Operating leases 140,773 38,928 65,490 6,016 30,339 Pension and other post retirement benefits 108,133 12,208 23,363 22,604 49,958 Total contractual obligations $ 1,801,180 $ 277,352 $ 251,679 $ 389,587 $ 882,562 The purchase obligations amount relates primarily to annual commitments relating to the Companys natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing long term contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to ten years. Approximately $25.5 million of these annual costs are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. The other liabilities line represents the total estimated payout for the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program and the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the Companys drilling program. In 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with Highlands Drilling, LLC (Highlands) for Highlands to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company. These obligations totaled approximately $84.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and are included in the operating lease obligations above. Also included in operating lease obligations are $1.3 million of terminated operating leases for facilities deemed to have no economic benefit to the Company as a result of the relocation of the Company to a new corporate headquarters in 2005. As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total FIN 48 liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 of $50.8 million. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In June 2006, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals issued a decision involving interpretation of certain types of oil and gas leases of an unrelated party, in a case where a class of royalty owners in the state of West Virginia had filed a lawsuit claiming that the defendant underpaid royalties by deducting certain post production costs not permitted by such types of leases and not paying a fair value for the gas produced from the royalty owners leases. In January 2007, the jury in the aforementioned case returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff royalty owners, awarding the plaintiffs significant compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged underpayment of royalties. While the defendant has appealed the verdict, this decision may ultimately impact other royalty interest rights in West Virginia. Claims have been brought against others in the oil and gas industry, including the Company. The Company is vigorously defending its case and believes that the claims and facts in the unrelated lawsuit can be differentiated from those asserted against the Company. Nevertheless, the Company has reviewed its West Virginia royalty agreements and established a reserve it believes to be appropriate. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional description of this litigation. In the ordinary course of business, various other legal claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with 44 certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company has established reserves for pending litigation, which it believes are adequate, and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingent liabilities and commitments. Corporate Reorganization to a Holding Company Structure The Company has filed applications with the PA PUC and WV PSC to reorganize into a holding company. The Company is pursing a holding company reorganization because the Company believes that the separation of its state regulated distribution operations into a new subsidiary will better segregate its regulated and unregulated businesses and improve overall financing flexibility. To effect the reorganization, the Company intends to merge with a second tier subsidiary (MergerSub), which will result in a first tier subsidiary (New EQT) becoming the new publicly traded parent company of the Equitable Resources family of companies. Following the merger, the Company will transfer to New EQT all of the assets and liabilities of the Company other than those of the Companys existing Equitable Gas Company division and New EQT and its subsidiaries will continue to conduct the business and operations that the Company and its subsidiaries conducted immediately before the effective time of the reorganization. The Company successfully completed a request for direction to holders of notes under the indentures governing its long term debt. The Company has also received a no action letter from the SEC satisfactorily addressing certain elements of the proposed reorganization. The Company expects to complete the reorganization upon receipt of PA PUC and WV PSC approvals. The chart below reflects the simplified organizational structure of the Company immediately before the holding company reorganization: The chart below reflects the simplified organizational structure of the Company immediately after the holding company reorganization: 45 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon Equitables Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed and approved by the Companys Audit Committee, relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Share Based Compensation: The Company awards share based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan. The Company treats its Executive Performance Incentive Programs as variable plan liabilities. The actual cost to be recorded for the 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2005 Program) will not be known until the measurement date, which is December 31, 2008, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized. The number of units to be paid out under the 2005 Program is dependent upon a combination of a level of total shareholder return relative to the performance of a peer group and the Companys average absolute return on capital during the four year performance period. In 2007, the Company implemented the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program (2007 Supply Program), also a variable plan liability. The number of units to be paid out under the 2007 Supply Program is dependent upon the achievement of pre determined total sales volumes targets and the satisfaction of certain applicable employment requirements. The Company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the value of the ultimate payout. In the current period, the Company estimated that the performance measures for the 2005 Program would be met at 225% of the full value of the units and that the estimated end of 2008 share price would be $60.00. This was an increase from the Companys assumptions in 2006 of 175% of the full value of the units and an estimated end of 2008 share price of $45.00, which resulted in a significant compensation expense charge in 2007. The Company estimated that the performance measures for the 2007 Supply Program would be met at 100% of the full value of the units and that the estimated end of 2010 share price would be $72.00. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share based compensation are critical accounting estimates because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the Companys shares, the performance of the peer group for the 2005 Program and the achievement of pre determined total sales volumes targets for the 2007 Supply Program. Additionally, the impact on net income of these changes can be material. Managements assumptions regarding these performance factors require significant judgment. In regard to the 2005 Program, each peer companys inherent volatility combined with the volatility in commodity prices make it difficult to provide sensitivity metrics to demonstrate the impact a change in the Companys stock price will have on the estimated payout. However, assuming no change in the attainment of performance measures, a 10% increase in the Companys stock price assumption for December 31, 2008 would result in an increase in 2008 compensation expense under the Long Term Incentive Plan of approximately $14 million. A 10% decrease in the Companys stock price assumptions would result in a decrease in 2008 compensation expense of the same amount. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from mark to market hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss, deferred revenues and expenses and state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. The Company also recorded a $0.1 million charge in 2007 and 2006 and a $15.3 million charge in 46 2005 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain executive compensation plans, as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the IRC. No other valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes under the provisions of FIN 48. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The recognition threshold is the first step which requires the Company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position in order to record any financial statement benefit. If the first step is satisfied, then the Company must measure the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement. To the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed and considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. Evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Contingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The recording of contingencies is guided by the principles of SFAS No. 5. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results. In addition to the obligation to record contingent liabilities, SFAS No. 143 requires that the Company accrue a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Companys plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company increases the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value, through charges to depreciation, depletion, and amortization, and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets. The Company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems, and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives. 47 The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities. Depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit. The depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves. The carrying values of the Companys proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. In order to determine whether impairment has occurred, the Company estimates the expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from its proved oil and gas properties and compares them to their respective carrying values. The estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves, utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset and forward market prices for oil and gas. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable. Those properties would be written down to fair value, which would be estimated using assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. In developing estimates of fair value, the Company uses forward market prices. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which is significantly impacted by forward market prices for oil and gas. Should the Company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities, future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Oil and Gas Reserves: Proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Companys engineers and reviewed by the Companys independent engineers. Additionally, the Company estimates future rates of production, the timing of development expenditures and prospective market prices for oil and gas and applies the appropriate year end income tax rate. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must periodically re evaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Commodity Instruments The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily through the Equitable Supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the Equitable Utilities segment. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption Commodity Risk Management in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K. The Company uses non leveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. 48 Commodity Price Risk The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in commodity prices. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Companys forecasted production, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels, which are exposed to price risk. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales, which are exposed to price risk, the Company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company include futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements, which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity. The Company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. Historically, the Companys strategy has been to hedge production at prices considered to provide the opportunity to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility. The Company may revisit its hedging strategy as a result of the increase in well development and infrastructure investment at Equitable Supply. To the extent that the Company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price, the Company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2007, the Company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2013 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 251.9 Bcf of natural gas. See the Commodity Risk Management in the Capital Resources and Liquidity sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10 K for further discussion. For the sensitivity analysis set forth below, the Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal change in fair value as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at December 31, 2007. The price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Companys balance sheet, resulting in the change in fair value. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2007 levels would increase the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $194.5 million. A hypothetical increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2007 levels would decrease the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately the same amount. The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected. If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. 49 For derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes, the Company engages in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company for trading purposes include forward contracts and swap agreements. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2007 levels would not have a significant impact on the fair value of derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for trading purposes as of December 31, 2007. Other Market Risks The Company has variable rate short term debt. As such, there is some exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the Company under its current capital structure. The Company maintains fixed rate long term debt that is not subject to risk exposure from fluctuating interest rates. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value. The Company believes that NYMEX traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants, including the Company, from any potential financial instability of the exchange members. The Company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the Companys criteria for credit and liquidity strength. The Company utilizes various information technology systems to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits. To manage the level of credit risk, the Company deals with counterparties that are of investment grade or better, enters into netting agreements whenever possible, and may obtain collateral or other security. Three percent, or $13.7 million, of OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007 have a positive fair value. All derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 are with counterparties who have an S&P rating of A or above. As of December 31, 2007, there was no event of default with any counterparty to a derivative contract. Furthermore, the Company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.50
