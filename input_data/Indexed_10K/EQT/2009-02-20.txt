Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations EQTs consolidated income from continuing operations for 2008 was $255.6 million, $2.00 per diluted share, compared with $257.5 million, $2.10 per diluted share, for 2007 and $216.0 million, $1.77 per diluted share, for 2006. The $1.9 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2007 to 2008 reflects an increase in operating income of $153.1 million which was more than offset by the absence of a 2007 pre tax gain of $126.1 million on the sale of assets in the Nora area, higher 2008 interest and income taxes and a 2008 other than temporary impairment loss on available for sale securities. Operating income for 2008 was impacted by decreased incentive compensation expense, increased production revenues due to higher average well head sales prices and significantly higher volumes, increased gathering and transmission revenues due to higher rates and volumes, and the absence of 2007 transaction costs associated with the terminated Peoples and Hope acquisition. The decreased incentive compensation expense was the result of the reversal of previously recorded expense on the Companys 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program partially offset by increases in short term incentive compensation. These items were partially offset by increased depletion, depreciation and amortization, increased operating and administrative expenses and the impact of the May 2007 asset sales. The $41.5 million increase in income from continuing operations from 2006 to 2007 resulted from several factors, including the 2007 pre tax gain of $126.1 million on the sale of assets in the Nora area. At Equitable Distribution, revenues increased primarily due to colder weather in Equitable Gass service territory. At EQT Midstream, an increase in transmission and storage revenues due to increased storage asset optimization transactions and utilization of contractual transmission capacity to increase its wholesale marketing activities and an increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues due to higher frac spreads for NGLs extracted in 2007 were partially offset by a decrease in revenues due to the 2006 favorable impact of the settlement of the Equitrans rate case. At EQT Production, revenues increased due to higher production sales volumes. The increased revenue between 2006 and 2007 was partially offset by a $46.2 million increase in incentive compensation expense, the $10.1 million write off of deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the proposed acquisition of Peoples and Hope, and $9.7 million in higher depletion, depreciation and amortization, primarily at EQT Production. In addition, higher labor costs and charges for certain legal reserves, settlements and related expenses partially offset the increases in income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate for 2008 was 37.7% compared to 35.9% in 2007. The higher effective tax rate in 2008 is the result of several factors including the Company being in a net operating loss position for tax purposes in 2008 which results in the loss of certain deductions for 2008 and for prior years as a result of carrying losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid. In addition, state taxes increased due to limitations imposed on certain state tax losses generated in 2008 and the Company recorded a net increase to tax expense as a result of the completion of its IRS audit through the 2005 tax year, slightly offset by a beneficial change in the West Virginia state tax law. The Companys effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 35.9% compared to 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The higher effective tax rate in 2007 is the result of several factors including a change in the West Virginia state tax law and a reduced 2006 rate resulting from the release of state valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryovers. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income. Interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive expenses 27 Table of Contents (income) and administrative expenses totaling ($17.4) million, $65.3 million and $21.9 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were not allocated to business segments. The unallocated income in 2008 primarily relates to the reversal of previously recorded performance related incentive expenses, while the unallocated expense in 2007 and 2006 relates to performance related incentive expenses in those years. The Company has reconciled each segments operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income totals in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQTs management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQTs segments without being obscured by these items for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. EQT Production Overview EQTs strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing the Companys extensive acreage position through organic growth enabled by a low cost structure. The Company is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program and believes that it is a technological leader in drilling in low pressure shale. In particular, the use of air in horizontal drilling has proven to be a cost effective technology which the Company has efficiently deployed to various geological formations in the Appalachian mountain terrain and which may be deployed to other Company assets in the Basin to maximize production. The Company drilled 668 gross wells (533 net wells) in 2008, including 23 Marcellus wells (16 vertical and 7 horizontal), 24 horizontal Berea wells, and 357 horizontal wells targeting the Lower Huron. Proved reserves increased 428 Bcfe (16%) to 3,110 Bcfe during the year. EQT Productions revenues for 2008 increased approximately 26% compared to 2007 revenues. Gas sales volumes increased 12% from 2007, excluding volumes from properties sold during 2007, primarily as a result of increased production from the 2008 and 2007 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys producing wells. Well head sales prices increased approximately 16%, as increased commodity market prices offset slightly lower hedge prices year over year. Operating expenses at EQT Production include an $8.2 million increase in the Companys exploration program. The increase in exploration expense is a result of the Companys initiative to explore additional reserve opportunities in various exploration plays on its legacy acreage position with the purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties. Excluding exploration expenses, 2008 operating expenses increased 21% primarily due to higher depletion resulting from increased drilling investments, increased lease operating expenses due to increased production volumes and higher production taxes due to higher prices and volumes, partially offset by the absence of 2007 charges for legal reserves, settlements and related expenses. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % change 2008 2007 2006 % change 2007 2006 OPERATIONAL DATA Production: Natural gas and oil production (MMcfe) (a) 90,585 83,114 9.0 81,371 2.1 Company usage, line loss (MMcfe) (6,577 ) (6,035 ) 9.0 (5,215 ) 15.7 Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 84,008 77,079 9.0 76,156 1.2 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) $ 5.32 $ 4.59 15.9 $ 4.60 (0.2 ) Lease operating expenses (LOE), excluding production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.35 $ 0.31 12.9 $ 0.29 6.9 Production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.52 $ 0.43 20.9 $ 0.47 (8.5 ) Production depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 0.81 $ 0.70 15.7 $ 0.62 12.9 Production depletion $ 73,362 $ 58,264 25.9 $ 50,330 15.8 Other depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) 4,872 3,820 27.5 3,141 21.6 Total DD&A $ 78,234 $ 62,084 26.0 $ 53,471 16.1 Capital expenditures (thousands) (b) $ 700,745 $ 328,080 113.6 $ 205,047 60.0 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 457,144 $ 364,396 25.5 $ 359,526 1.4 Operating expenses: LOE, excluding production taxes 31,719 25,361 25.1 23,818 6.5 Production taxes (c) 47,158 36,123 30.5 38,198 (5.4 ) Exploration expense 9,064 862 951.5 802 7.5 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 38,185 37,947 0.6 27,814 36.4 DD&A 78,234 62,084 26.0 53,471 16.1 Total operating expenses 204,360 162,377 25.9 144,103 12.7 Operating income $ 252,784 $ 202,019 25.1 $ 215,423 (6.2 ) (a) Natural gas and oil production represents the Companys interest in gas and oil production measured at the well head.

(c) Production taxes include severance and production related ad valorem and other property taxes. 29 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. December 31, 2007 EQT Productions operating income totaled $252.8 million for 2008 compared to $202.0 million for 2007, an increase of $50.8 million between years, primarily due to a higher average well head sales price and increased gas sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Total operating revenues were $457.1 million for 2008 compared to $364.4 million for 2007. The $92.7 million increase in operating revenues was due to higher realized prices and increased sales volumes. The average well head sales price increase by $0.73 per Mcfe, primarily as a result of an increase in NYMEX natural gas prices and a higher percentage of unhedged gas sales, partially offset by a lower realized hedge price. Additionally, sales volumes increased 12% excluding the 2007 sale of interests which provided sales of 1,966 MMcfe during 2007, as a result of the 2008 and 2007 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the Companys wells. Operating expenses totaled $204.4 million for 2008 compared to $162.4 million for 2007. The $42.0 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of $16.2 million in DD&A, $11.0 million in production taxes, $6.4 million in LOE, and $0.2 million in SG&A. In addition, the 2008 period includes an $8.2 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the Companys examination of emerging plays. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate ($9.9 million) and volume ($5.0 million). The $0.11 increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The increase in production taxes was primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in severance taxes and a $1.2 million increase in property taxes. The increase in severance taxes (a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted) was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes. The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years, as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the Companys wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The increase in LOE was attributable to personnel costs, the 2008 program to test the re fracturing of existing wells, salt water and waste disposal, environmental costs and road and location maintenance. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the Company partially offset by lower charges for certain legal disputes in 2008 compared to 2007. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007 vs. December 31, 2006 EQT Productions operating income totaled $202.0 million for 2007 compared to $215.4 million for 2006, a decrease of $13.4 million between years, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Total operating revenues were $364.4 million for 2007 compared to $359.5 million for 2006. The $4.9 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a 1% increase in total sales volumes as a result of the 2007 and 2006 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the Companys wells and was partially offset by the 2007 sale of interests which provided sales of 3,044 MMcfe during 2006. In addition, the average well head sales price decreased $0.01 per Mcfe primarily due to a decrease in NYMEX natural gas prices, partially offset by a higher percentage of unhedged gas sales and a higher realized hedge price. Operating expenses totaled $162.4 million for 2007 compared to $144.1 million for 2006. The $18.3 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $10.1 million in SG&A, $8.6 million in DD&A and $1.5 million in LOE, excluding production taxes, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in production taxes. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to increased legal reserves, settlements and related expenses in 2007 compared to the reduction of certain liability reserves in 2006, partially offset by 2006 increases to the reserve established for uncollectible accounts. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate ($6.9 million) and volume ($1.0 million). The $0.08 increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The increase in LOE, excluding production taxes, was attributable to personnel costs, environmental costs and liability insurance costs. The decrease in production taxes was primarily due to a decrease in severance taxes arising out of the sale of assets in the Nora area. 30 Table of Contents See the Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of EQT Productions capital expenditures during 2008, 2007 and 2006. Outlook EQT Productions business strategy is focused on organic growth of the Companys natural gas reserves and sales volumes. Key elements of EQT Productions strategy include: Expanding reserves and production through horizontal drilling in Kentucky and West Virginia. The Company is committed to expanding its reserves and production through horizontal drilling, exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays and expanding its infrastructure in the Appalachian Basin. The Company will seek to maximize the value of its existing asset base by developing its large acreage position, which the Company believes holds significant production and reserve growth potential. A substantial portion of the Companys 2009 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in Kentucky and West Virginia. Exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays. In 2009, the Company will examine the potential for exploitation of gas reserves in new geological formations and through different technologies. Plans include the drilling of horizontal Berea and Marcellus wells and testing the Devonian shale in Virginia. In addition, the Company intends to obtain proprietary seismic data in order to evaluate future deep drilling opportunities in certain emerging plays. 31 Table of Contents EQT Midstream Overview EQT Midstream provides gathering, processing, transmission and storage services to EQT Production and independent third parties. In 2008, EQT Midstream focused on building a long term growth platform, highlighted by the construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline, the Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant and the Mayking corridor. This infrastructure development facilitates the development of EQT Productions growing reserve base in the Huron play and provides opportunities to sell capacity to third parties. In 2009, EQT Midstream will focus on continuing to expand its gathering system through well connections to existing midstream infrastructure and thereby filling existing capacity. Additionally, initial infrastructure expansion in the Marcellus play in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia is slated for 2009. EQT Midstream achieved a number of operational milestones in 2008. In the second half of the year, EQT Midstream completed construction on the expansion of the Kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant and gas compression facilities (Kentucky Hydrocarbon) and turned in line the Mayking Corridor project (Mayking). Kentucky Hydrocarbon has the capacity to process 170 MMcfe of natural gas per day. Mayking consists of three compressor units and 38 miles of pipe. In the second quarter, the Big Sandy Pipeline, a 68 mile pipeline that connects Kentucky Hydrocarbon to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline and currently provides up to 130,000 Dth per day of firm transportation service, came on line. The combination of Kentucky Hydrocarbon, Mayking and the Big Sandy Pipeline provide the platform for significant sales growth starting in the fourth quarter of 2008 and beyond and will help to mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the Companys gathering systems in transporting gas to market. Also in 2008, Equitable Energy executed a binding precedent agreement with TGP for a 15 year term that, along with other contractual provisions, awarded the Company 300,000 Dth per day of capacity in TGPs 300 Line expansion project. When completed, this expansion project will consist of approximately 128 miles of 30 inch pipe loop and approximately 52,000 horsepower of additional compression facilities to be constructed in TGPs existing pipeline corridor in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The awarded capacity will provide Equitable Energy access to consumer markets along the TGP long line transmission system from the Gulf Coast to the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast United States. EQT Midstreams net operating revenues increased by 16% from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in the average gathering fee, higher processing net revenues and transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline. Increases in net operating revenues were more than offset by an increase in operating expenses which included $10.7 million for the settlement of certain pension and post retirement benefits including related severance and legal fees. During May 2007, the EQT Midstream segment contributed certain Nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to Nora Gathering, LLC, a newly formed entity that is equally owned by the Company and Pine Mountain Oil and Gas, Inc. (PMOG), in exchange for a 50% equity interest in the LLC and cash. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction. As a result of the gathering asset contribution, gathered volumes, gathering revenues and gathering related expenses related to the Nora area gathering activities are no longer included in EQT Midstreams operating results beginning in the second quarter of 2007. However, EQT Midstream records its 50% equity interest in the earnings of Nora Gathering, LLC in equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments. Also in 2007, EQT purchased certain gathering assets in the Roaring Fork area from the minority interest holders. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % change 2008 2007 2006 % change 2007 2006 OPERATIONAL DATA Gathering and processing: Gathered volumes (BBtu) 145,031 143,338 1.2 157,248 (8.8 ) Average gathering fee ($/MMBtu) $ 0.98 $ 0.84 16.7 $ 0.79 6.3 Gathering and compression expense ($/MMBtu) (b) $ 0.37 $ 0.35 5.7 $ 0.28 25.0 NGLs sold (Mgal) (a) 81,856 72,430 13.0 70,963 2.1 Average NGL sales price($/gal) $ 1.24 $ 1.07 15.9 $ 0.95 12.6 Transmission pipeline throughput (BBtu): 76,270 53,514 42.5 53,151 0.7 Net operating revenues (thousands): Gathering and processing $ 175,641 $ 149,590 17.4 $ 140,312 6.6 Transmission and storage 127,699 112,325 13.7 113,080 (0.7 ) Total net operating revenues $ 303,340 $ 261,915 15.8 $ 253,392 3.4 Net operating income (thousands): Gathering and processing $ 58,575 $ 65,003 (9.9 ) $ 57,047 13.9 Transmission and storage 76,197 75,429 1.0 80,130 (5.9 ) Total net operating income $ 134,772 $ 140,432 (4.0 ) $ 137,177 2.4 DD&A (thousands): Gathering and processing $ 25,575 $ 19,230 33.0 $ 18,287 5.2 Transmission and storage 9,227 7,103 29.9 7,535 (5.7 ) Total DD&A $ 34,802 $ 26,333 32.2 $ 25,822 2.0 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 593,564 $ 433,719 36.9 $ 146,512 196.0 (a) NGLs sold includes NGLs recovered at the Companys processing plant and transported to a fractionation plant owned by a third party for separation into commercial components, net of volumes retained, as well as equivalent volumes sold at liquid component prices under the Companys contractual processing arrangements with third parties.

An increase in net operating revenues was more than offset by increased operating expenses, including a $10.7 million settlement charge for pension and post retirement benefits including related severance and legal fees, and $5.2 million bad debt expense as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Excluding these items, operating income increased 7%. Total net operating revenues were $303.3 million for 2008 compared to $261.9 million for 2007. The $41.4 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $26.0 million increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues and a $15.4 million increase in transmission and storage net operating revenues. The increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues was due to a 17% increase in the average gathering fee, increased NGLs sold, increased commodity prices for propane and other NGLs and a small increase in gathered volumes. The increase in the average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to ensuring that this fee is sufficient to cover costs associated with infrastructure expansion. The volume of NGLs sold increased in 2008 as a result of the Companys infrastructure investments. Gathered volumes increased 1% due to the increase in 2008 Company production and third party volumes which were partially offset by the elimination in 2008 of volumes gathered on assets contributed to Nora Gathering, LLC. The increase in transmission and storage net operating revenues was due to new transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline, which came on line in the second quarter of 2008 and increased third party marketing that utilized Big Sandy Pipeline capacity. Total operating revenues increased by $89.9 million, or 15%, primarily as a result of higher sales prices on increased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets, an increase in processing volumes and commodity prices, higher gathering rates and new transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline. Total purchased gas costs increased due to the higher gas costs on increased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets as well as higher gas costs related to processing activities. Operating expenses totaled $168.6 million for 2008 compared to $121.5 million for 2007. The $47.1 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $20.2 million in SG&A, $18.4 million in O&M, and $8.5 34 Table of Contents million in DD&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to labor and services to support the growth in the Midstream business, a $5.2 million reserve against Lehman Brothers receivables, and $1.2 million for legal and actuarial services associated with the pension and other post retirement charge, partially offset by decreased SG&A for the gathering assets contributed to Nora Gathering, LLC. The increase in O&M resulted mainly from the $9.5 million pension and other post retirement charge as well as increased electricity charges, compressor maintenance, labor and non income taxes for the gathering and processing business due to new compressors and processing facilities, partially offset by the expenses associated with gathering asset contributed to Nora Gathering, LLC. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to the increased investment in infrastructure during 2008, partially offset by decreased depreciation relating to the gathering asset contribution to Nora Gathering, LLC. Other income represents allowance for equity funds used during construction. The $1.6 million decrease from 2007 to 2008 was primarily caused by a full year of AFUDC on Big Sandy recorded in 2007, as compared to only a partial year in 2008 as Big Sandy was placed on line in the second quarter of 2008. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled $5.1 million for 2008 compared to $2.6 million for 2007. This increase is related to equity earnings recorded for EQT Midstreams investment in Nora Gathering, LLC, which was formed in May 2007. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007 vs. December 31, 2006 EQT Midstreams operating income totaled $140.4 million for 2007 compared to $137.2 million for 2006, an increase of $3.2 million between years. An increase in net operating revenues was largely offset by increased operating expenses. Total net operating revenues were $261.9 million for 2007 compared to $253.4 million for 2006. The $8.5 million increase in total net operating revenues was due primarily to increases in gathering and processing net operating revenues, partially offset by a decrease in transmission and storage net operating revenues. The $9.3 million increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues was due to higher sales prices for the NGL products sold in 2007 as compared to 2006, a 2% increase in NGL volumes sold and a 6% increase in the average gathering fee, partially offset by a 9% decline in gathered volumes. Commodity market prices for propane and other NGLs increased significantly in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to ensuring that this fee is sufficient to cover costs associated with infrastructure expansion. The decrease in gathered volumes is primarily the result of a reduction in volumes gathered for EQT Production due to the contribution of gathering facilities and pipelines to Nora Gathering, LLC, partially offset by increased Company production. The $0.8 million decrease in transmission and storage net operating revenues was primarily due to the positive effect of the Equitrans rate case settlement of $7.0 million recorded in 2006, partially offset by storage asset optimization realized in 2007 as the Company used contractual storage capacity to capture unusually high summer to winter price spreads, Equitrans Pipeline Safety surcharge that was formally approved by the FERC in November 2007 and increased firm transportation rates year over year. The storage price spreads were captured at a time of high volatility and the transactions settled in 2007. Operating expenses totaled $121.5 million for 2007 compared to $116.2 million for 2006. The $5.3 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $2.4 million in O&M and $1.4 million in SG&A, $1.0 million in impairment charge reversals recorded in 2006 and an increase of $0.5 million in DD&A. The increase in O&M was due to increased expense in 2007 for the Companys gathering and transmission facilities primarily due to increased electricity charges on newly installed electric compressors, increased field line and compressor maintenance, increased field labor and related employment costs, increased compliance and maintenance costs and increased fleet related costs, as well as the recognition of $0.7 million of pipeline safety costs that were deferred pending the FERC order on the Equitrans Pipeline Safety surcharge. Partially offsetting these increases in O&M were a decrease in O&M expenses relating to the gathering asset contribution to Nora Gathering, LLC and a decrease due to a 2006 pension and other post retirement benefits charge of $3.3 million for an early retirement program relating to the gathering and processing business. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to higher labor costs including higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by decreased SG&A for the gathering assets contributed to Nora Gathering, LLC. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to the increased investment in gathering infrastructure during 2007 partially offset by decreased depreciation relating to the gathering asset contribution to Nora Gathering, LLC. 35 Table of Contents Other income represents AFUDC Equity and the $6.2 million increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily the result of increased capital spending for the Big Sandy Pipeline as well as spending on pipeline safety and integrity projects. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled $2.6 million for 2007 and related to equity earnings recorded for EQT Midstreams investment in Nora Gathering, LLC. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity section for discussion of EQT Midstreams capital expenditures during 2008, 2007 and 2006. Outlook EQT Midstream is focused on building a long term growth platform to facilitate the development of EQT Productions growing reserve base. In 2009, under current capital market conditions, EQT Midstream will fill existing capacity by building smaller gathering lines in Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania to tie in wells. This will facilitate the delivery of gas from wells drilled by EQT Production in 2009 and will provide additional capacity to help mitigate curtailments, increase the flexibility and reliability of the Companys gathering systems in transporting gas to market and provide additional capacity for growth. EQT Midstream will also make the initial infrastructure expansion in the Companys Marcellus play in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. In addition, processing upgrades to the Kentucky Hydrocarbon plant are planned. If the capital markets become less constrained, EQT Midstream will consider increasing investment in corridor infrastructure projects to provide additional capacity needed to facilitate production growth. 36 Table of Contents Equitable Distribution Overview Equitable Distributions business strategy is to earn a competitive return on its asset base through regulatory mechanisms and operational efficiency. Equitable Distribution is focused on enhancing the value of its existing assets by establishing a reputation for excellent customer service, effectively managing its capital spending, improving the efficiency of its workforce through superior work management and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations. In 2008, Equitable Gas filed a base rate case in Pennsylvania to recover an increased return on assets placed in service since the previous rate case and to fully recover costs associated with the CAP. In November 2008, Equitable Gas reached a settlement with the active parties that would result in a projected revenue increase of approximately $38 million annually compared to the requested increase of $51.9 million. The settlement must be approved by the PA PUC to be effective. On January 20, 2009, a PA PUC Administrative Law Judge recommended approval of the rate case settlement by the PA PUC. The PA PUC approval is expected before March 31, 2009. If approved, this settlement will result in the first delivery rate increase for Equitable Gas in more than a decade. Since 1997, Equitable Gas has invested more than $360 million to upgrade its pipeline infrastructure, improve the efficiency of its operations and enhance the quality of its customer service. As a result of these investments, the company now ranks among the highest in Pennsylvania in gas utility call center service levels and has achieved documented improvements in on time scheduled appointment performance and safety. Pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist low income customers with paying their gas bills. The costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers. Equitable Gas has several such programs, including the CAP. On September 27, 2007, the PA PUC issued an order approving an increase to Equitable Gass CAP surcharge, which is designed to offset the costs of the CAP. The revised surcharge went into effect on October 2, 2007. If the rate case settlement is approved, Equitable Gas will increase the CAP surcharge from $0.58 per mcf to $1.30 per mcf and will receive an annual reconciliation of CAP costs to ensure complete recovery beginning in the first quarter of 2009. Equitable Distributions net operating revenues increased 6% from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the increase in surcharges collected to support CAP and colder weather in Equitable Gas service territory in 2008. The weather in Equitable Gas service territory in 2008 was 5% colder than 2007, but was still 4% warmer than the 30 year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) average for the Companys service territory. The weather in 2007 was 9% warmer than the 30 year average. Total operating expenses decreased 12% from 2007, primarily due to the absence of transaction and transition planning costs related to the terminated Peoples and Hope acquisition incurred in 2007, partially offset by a 2008 increase in CAP expenses. These increased CAP costs were recovered through an increase in collected CAP surcharge. On March 1, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Dominions natural gas distribution assets in Pennsylvania and in West Virginia for approximately $970 million, subject to adjustments, in a cash transaction for the stock of Peoples and Hope. In light of the continued delay in achieving the legal approvals for this transaction, the Company and Dominion agreed to terminate the agreement pursuant to a mutual termination agreement entered into on January 15, 2008. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized a charge of $10.1 million for acquisition costs that were previously deferred. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % change 2008 2007 2006 % change 2007 2006 OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,829) 5,622 5,332 5.4 4,976 7.2 Residential sales and transportation volume (MMcf) 23,824 23,494 1.4 21,014 11.8 Commercial and industrial volume (MMcf) 27,503 25,971 5.9 23,841 8.9 Total throughput (MMcf) Distribution 51,327 49,465 3.8 44,855 10.3 Net operating revenues (thousands): Residential $ 105,059 $ 99,050 6.1 $ 92,497 7.1 Commercial & industrial 46,394 42,558 9.0 42,519 0.1 Off system and energy services 19,415 19,021 2.1 15,647 21.6 Total net operating revenues 170,868 $ 160,629 6.4 $ 150,663 6.6 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 45,770 $ 41,684 9.8 $ 48,721 (14.4 ) FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 698,385 $ 624,744 11.8 $ 586,194 6.6 Purchased gas costs 527,517 464,115 13.7 435,531 6.6 Net operating revenues 170,868 160,629 6.4 150,663 6.6 Operating expenses: O & M 44,161 41,613 6.1 40,690 2.3 SG&A 44,793 64,454 (30.5 ) 49,631 29.9 Impairment charges (1,369 ) (100.0 ) DD&A 22,055 20,021 10.2 19,938 0.4 Total operating expenses 111,009 126,088 (12.0 ) 108,890 15.8 Operating income $ 59,859 $ 34,541 73.3 $ 41,773 (17.3 ) Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. December 31, 2007 Equitable Distributions operating income totaled $59.9 million for 2008 compared to $34.5 million for 2007. The $25.4 million increase in operating income is primarily due to increased CAP surcharge revenues, colder weather and lower SG&A expenses due to the absence in 2008 of costs associated with the now terminated Peoples and Hope acquisition. Net operating revenues were $170.9 million for 2008 compared to $160.6 million for 2007. The $10.3 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily a result of increased CAP surcharge revenues. The CAP surcharge increased from $0.30 per mcf to $0.58 per mcf in the fourth quarter of 2007. Additionally, 2008 weather was 5% colder than the prior year. Commercial and industrial revenues increased due to an increase in performance based revenues as well as increased volumes of 1,532 MMcf from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to an increase in usage by one industrial customer. Off system and energy services net operating revenues increased due to increased gathering revenue as a result of increased volumes and rates, partially offset by lower volumes and margins in asset 38 Table of Contents optimization activities. Additionally, an increase in the commodity component of residential tariff rates resulted in an increase in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs. Operating expenses totaled $111.0 million for 2008 compared to $126.1 million for 2007. This $15.1 million decrease was primarily due to the impact of $21.0 million in 2007 costs related to the now terminated Peoples and Hope acquisition, a $2.5 million decrease in incentive compensation expenses and a $1.8 million reduction in insurance reserves due to increased safety measures. Partially offsetting these decreases were a $5.5 million increase in customer assistance expenses resulting from a significant increase in customer participation in the CAP and a $2.6 million increase in operating expenses primarily related to increased leak repair and maintenance activities for gathering operations, service line maintenance and line location requests and higher gas prices. Additionally, there was a $2.1 million increase in depreciation due to an adjustment in asset estimated useful lives resulting from the PA PUC mandated asset service life study as well as increased capital expenditures. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007 vs. December 31, 2006 Equitable Distributions operating income totaled $34.5 million for 2007 compared to $41.8 million for 2006. An increase in net operating revenues was more than offset by increased operating expenses primarily related to the fourth quarter of 2007 write off of deferred acquisition costs that resulted from the termination of the agreement to acquire Peoples and Hope. Net operating revenues were $160.6 million for 2007 compared to $150.7 million for 2006. The $9.9 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily a result of weather that was 7% colder than the prior year, resulting in a 2,480 MMcf increase in residential sales and transportation volumes from 2006 to 2007. Commercial and industrial volumes increased 2,130 MMcf from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to an increase in usage by one industrial customer. These high volume industrial sales have very low margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. Operating expenses totaled $126.1 million for 2007 compared to $108.9 million for 2006. Operating expenses for 2007 included a $10.1 million write off of costs previously deferred related to the now terminated agreement to acquire Peoples and Hope, while 2006 included a one time benefit of $1.4 million from the partial reversal of a 2005 impairment charge in connection with the Companys office consolidation. Other increases in operating expenses included higher corporate overhead allocations, increased labor costs including information technology enhancements and costs associated with a customer experience study of Equitable Gas customers. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense as a result of the continued organizational focus on collections, which resulted in reductions in delinquent accounts receivable and net write offs. Outlook As described above, Equitable Gas reached a settlement of its Pennsylvania rate case that, if approved, will result in a projected revenue increase of approximately $38 million annually. The new rates are expected to go into place no later than March 31, 2009, with the first full year impact realized in 2010 results. The rate increase will allow Equitable Distribution to earn an improved return on its asset base. Under the terms of the rate case settlement, Equitable Gas will also reduce exposure to the cost of PUC mandated customer assistance programs through a reconcilable surcharge. Customer conservation, which has occurred over time as a result of product efficiency and higher natural gas prices, has reduced residential customer usage over time. The Company has not, however, experienced a significant decrease in weather adjusted throughput or deterioration in customer collections in 2008 compared to recent levels. If the current economic downturn persists, Equitable Distribution may experience a reduction in commercial and industrial throughput as well as an increase in bad debt expense, which would reduce the return on its asset base. 39 Table of Contents Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Thousands) Other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities $ (7,835 ) $ $ Gain on sale of available for sale securities, net 1,042 Other income 6,233 7,645 1,442 Gain on sale of assets, net 126,088 Income from discontinued operations 4,261 During 2007, the EQT Production segment sold to PMOG a portion of the Companys interests in certain gas properties in the Nora area totaling approximately 74 Bcf of proved reserves. Also during 2007, the EQT Midstream segment contributed certain Nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to Nora Gathering, LLC in exchange for a 50% equity interest in Nora Gathering, LLC and cash. These transactions resulted in a net gain of $126.1 million. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. As discussed in Note 10 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Companys available for sale investments consist of equity and bond funds intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the Company self insures. At December 31, 2008, these investments had a fair market value which was $7.8 million below cost. The Company analyzed the decline in these investments based on the extent and duration of the impairment, the nature of the underlying assets and the Companys intent and ability to hold the investments. Although the Company holds these investments to fund long term liabilities, based on the extent and duration of the impairment, combined with current market conditions, the Company concluded that the decline was other than temporary. As such, the Company recognized a $7.8 million impairment in earnings in 2008. Also discussed in Note 10 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2007 the Company reviewed its investment portfolio (including its investment allocation) and sold equity funds with a cost basis of $6.3 million for total proceeds of $7.3 million, resulting in the Company recognizing a gain of $1.0 million. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, other income primarily relates to the equity portion of AFUDC. Prior to 2007, the equity portion of AFUDC was not significant and was included as an offset to interest expense in the Statements of Consolidated Income. As a result of the significance of the carrying costs related to the Big Sandy Pipeline and other regulated projects, AFUDC equity has been reclassified to other income in the Statements of Consolidated Income for all periods presented. AFUDC increased substantially in 2007 as a result of the substantial investment in the Big Sandy Pipeline then under construction. Construction was completed in the second quarter 2008, reducing AFUDC in the current year. The Companys NORESCO business is classified as discontinued operations due to the sale of the NORESCO domestic business in 2005 and sale of the Companys remaining international investment in early 2006. Income from discontinued operations for 2006 included a tax benefit of $3.2 million due to a reduced tax liability on the sale of the domestic business and after tax income of $1.1 million resulting from the Companys reassessment of its remaining obligations for costs incurred related to the sale of the domestic business. Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Thousands) Interest expense $ 58,394 $ 47,669 $ 48,494 Interest expense increased by $10.7 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the Companys investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2007 and 2008. This investment was partially funded by the issuance of $500 million of 6.5% notes in March 2008. The interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in the average short term interest rate during 2008. 40 Table of Contents Interest expense decreased by $0.8 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of the repayment of long term debt. A 1.2% increase in the weighted average annual short term interest rate was more than offset by an overall reduction in weighted average net short term debt outstanding, in part due to the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year. Weighted average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 3.5%, 5.8% and 4.6% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview The Companys primary sources of cash during 2008 were proceeds from a public offering of the Companys common stock and from a public offering of Senior Notes and cash flows from operating activities. The Company used the cash primarily to fund its capital program and to repay short term notes. Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $509.2 million for 2008 as compared to $426.7 million for 2007, a net increase of $82.5 million in cash flows provided by operating activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a net cash refund related to income taxes of $14.0 million in 2008 compared to a net cash payment of $63.4 million in 2007. For federal income tax purposes the Company typically deducts as intangible drilling costs (IDC) approximately 70% of its vertical drilling costs and 75% of its horizontal drilling costs in the year incurred. The IDC deduction resulting from its drilling program coupled with accelerated tax depreciation for expansion of the gathering infrastructure put the Company into an overall federal tax net operating loss position in 2008. This tax position is likely to continue so long as expansion in Appalachia continues. As such, the Company expects minimal federal cash taxes for the foreseeable future. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $426.7 million for 2007 as compared to $617.8 million for 2006, a net decrease of $191.1 million in cash flows provided by operating activities between years. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following: a $5.9 million increase in cash required for margin deposits on the Companys natural gas hedge agreements in 2007 compared to a $317.8 million decrease in cash required for margin deposits in 2006. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to significantly higher than normal gas prices in 2005 which resulted in increased deposit remittances in that year; a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.5 million in 2007 compared to a decrease in accounts receivable of $63.5 million in 2006. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005; partially offset by: an increase in other current liabilities of $99.4 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of $31.9 million in 2006, primarily related to incentive compensation plans and the timing of related payments; an increase in accounts payable of $65.9 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of $29.3 million in 2006. The increase in accounts payable in 2007 was primarily the result of increased capital spending, while the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006. 41 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1,376.0 million for 2008 as compared to $590.1 million for 2007, a net increase of $785.9 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following: an increase in capital expenditures to $1,344.0 million in 2008 from $776.7 million in 2007. See discussion of capital expenditures below; capital contributions of $29.0 million to Nora Gathering, LLC in 2008 for use in midstream infrastructure projects; the absence in 2008 of proceeds of $217.0 million received in 2007 from the sale and contribution of assets. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $590.1 million for 2007 as compared to $406.3 million for 2006, a net increase of $183.8 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following: an increase in capital expenditures to $776.7 million in 2007 from $403.1 million in 2006. See discussion of capital expenditures below; the Companys purchase of an additional working interest of approximately 13.5% in the Roaring Fork area in Virginia for $28.1 million in 2007: partially offset by: proceeds of $217.0 million received in 2007 from the sale and contribution of assets. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is committed to profitably expanding its reserves and production through horizontal drilling, exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays and expanding its infrastructure in the Appalachian Basin. However, in light of the current capital market conditions, the Company has developed a plan to reduce capital spending significantly for 2009 as compared to 2008 and anticipates that this capital spending plan will not require the Company to access capital markets through the end of 2010. This plan will be funded by the Companys cash flow from operating activities as well as a portion of the Companys $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. The Company remains flexible to reduce capital spending to operating cash flow levels should market conditions further deteriorate. The Company anticipates annual gas sales volume growth of 15% in 2009 42 Table of Contents through concentrating spending on drilling where midstream capacity has already been built. If the capital markets become unconstrained, the Company believes it has a long term production growth potential of greater than 20% per year. The Companys forecasted 2009 capital expenditures contemplate up to 675 gross wells, including 375 horizontals. Capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $701 million and $328 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company drilled 668 gross wells, including 389 gross horizontal wells in 2008, compared to 634 gross wells, including 88 gross horizontal wells during 2007. Capital expenditures for 2008 also included $85.2 million for undeveloped property acquisitions, primarily within the Marcellus acreage. Capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled $594 million and $434 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. These capital expenditures were used primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas pipelines and natural gas processing facilities. Included in such expenditures for 2008 was $366 million for gathering pipeline and compression, including $105 million in the Mayking corridor; $105 million for the Ranger liquids line project and Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant upgrade; and $35 million for completion of the Big Sandy Pipeline. Approximately $84 million of 2008 capital expenditures related to compliance, line loss, facilities and information technology. Capital expenditures for well development and midstream infrastructure increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increased drilling and development program in 2007, capital expended for the continued construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline, upgrades to the Kentucky Hydrocarbon plant and increased investment in gathering system compression and pipelines. Capital expenditures for distribution infrastructure decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the installation of electronic meter reading technology on meters in 2006, a project that was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2006. Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $785.1 million for 2008 as compared to $245.1 million of cash flows provided by financing activities for 2007. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable largely to the following: net proceeds of $560.7 million from a public offering of 8.625 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2008. The proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the Companys natural gas drilling, development and midstream infrastructure projects; a public offering during the first quarter of 2008 of $500.0 million in aggregate principal of 6.50% Senior Notes. The proceeds were used to repay short term borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $245.1 million for 2007 as compared to $286.5 million of cash flows used in financing activities for 2006, a net increase of $531.6 million in cash flows provided by financing activities between years. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable largely to a $314.0 million increase in amounts borrowed under short term loans in 2007 compared to a $229.3 million decrease in short term borrowings in 2006. The increase in short term borrowings in 2007 was for the purposes of funding capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. In addition to funding working capital requirements, which are significantly impacted by seasonality, the Company utilizes short term borrowings to fund margin deposit requirements until the underlying transactions are settled or the deposits are returned and to finance capital expenditures until they can be permanently financed. The Companys $1.5 billion revolving credit facility matures on October 26, 2011. The facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other purposes including support of a commercial paper program. 43 Table of Contents The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman) is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding $95 million under the facility. Lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the Company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to $1,405 million. Otherwise, the Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the Companys exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding under the revolving credit facility loans of $319.9 million in support of corporate purposes and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of $25.8 million. The weighted average interest rates on the Companys short term borrowings was 3.5% for 2008. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility fluctuates with the LIBOR rate. The Companys short term borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less. Security Ratings and Financing Triggers The table below reflects the current credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the Company. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Companys cost of short term and long term debt and its access to the credit markets. Unsecured Medium Term Commercial Rating Service Notes Paper Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB A 3 On October 15, 2008, S&P placed its ratings on EQT, as well as three other diversified energy companies, on CreditWatch with negative implications in light of an increasing percentage of operating income and capital spending that is related to oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) activities. S&P stated that it expected to resolve the CreditWatch listing within three months but has not yet announced a decision. On November 4, 2008, Moodys reaffirmed its ratings on EQT and stated that the rating reflects the diversification and vertical integration among its three business segments as well as the Baa stand alone quality of both its E&P and LDC (local distribution company) operations. The Companys credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the credit rating agencies downgrade the Companys ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Companys access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs and margin deposits would increase, counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. The required margin is subject to significant change as a result of other factors besides credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. The Companys debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. The most significant default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Companys current credit facilitys financial covenants require a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2008, the Company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. 44 Table of Contents Commodity Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Companys risk management program includes the use of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts and options and OTC natural gas swap agreements and options (collectively, derivative commodity instruments) to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily fixed price swaps or collars. The approximate volumes and prices of the Companys total hedge position for 2009 through 2011 are: 2009 2010 2011 Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 37 23 19 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 5.91 $ 5.12 $ 5.10 Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 23 21 18 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 7.34 $ 7.29 $ 7.16 Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 13.68 $ 13.51 $ 13.48 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf The Companys current hedged position provides price protection for greater than 65% of expected production in 2009 and 40% of expected production through 2011. The Companys earnings per share exposure to a $0.10 change in average NYMEX natural gas price is approximately $0.03 per diluted share for 2009 and ranges from $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share per year for 2010 and 2011. The Company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices. See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in Item 7A and Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Items Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic business in 2005, the Company agreed to maintain certain guarantees which benefit NORESCO. These guarantees, the majority of which predate the sale of NORESCO, became off balance sheet arrangements upon the closing of the sale of NORESCO. These arrangements include guarantees of NORESCOs obligations to the purchasers of certain of NORESCOs contract receivables and agreements to maintain guarantees supporting NORESCOs obligations under certain customer contracts. In addition, NORESCO and the purchaser agreed that NORESCO would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and that the purchaser or NORESCO would reimburse the Company for losses under the guarantees. The purchasers obligations to reimburse the Company are capped at $6 million. The total maximum potential obligation under these arrangements is estimated to be approximately $318 million as of December 31, 2008, and decreases over time as the guarantees expire or the underlying obligations are fulfilled by NORESCO. In 2008, the original purchaser of NORESCO sold its interest in NORESCO and transferred its obligations to a third party. In connection with that event, the new owner is expected to deliver to the Company a $1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations. The Company determined that the likelihood the Company will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote, and as such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees. In November 1995, EQT, through a subsidiary, guaranteed a tax indemnification to the limited partners of Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP) for any tax losses resulting from a disallowance of the nonconventional fuels 45 Table of Contents tax credits, if certain representations and warranties of the Company were not true. The Company guaranteed the tax indemnification until the tax statute of limitations closes. The Company does not have any recourse provisions with third parties or any collateral held by third parties associated with this guarantee that could be liquidated to recover amounts paid, if any, under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2008, the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is estimated to be approximately $12 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45, and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. Additionally, based on the status of the Companys IRS examinations, the Company has determined that any potential loss from this guarantee is remote. The Company has a non equity interest in a variable interest entity, Appalachian NPI, LLC (ANPI), in which EQT was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Thus, ANPI is not consolidated within the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In determining the primary beneficiary, the Company estimated the expected losses and expected residual returns of ANPI under various scenarios in order to identify the party that would absorb the majority of the losses or benefit from the majority of the returns. The primary assumptions utilized in the scenarios included commodity price and production volumes. As of December 31, 2008, ANPI had $181 million of total assets and $227 million of total liabilities (including $102 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. ANPI is financed primarily through cash provided by operating activities. The Company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to ANPI, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the projects future cash flows from the preceding year end until the termination date of the agreement. This liquidity reserve guarantee is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT). The Company received a market based fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2008, the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately $22 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee, as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance. The terms of the ANPI liquidity reserve guarantee require the Company to provide a letter of credit in favor of ANPI as security for the Companys obligations. The amount of this letter of credit requirement at December 31, 2008 was approximately $25.8 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee. The Company has entered into an agreement with ANGT to provide gathering and operating services to deliver ANGTs gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $15.9 million, $15.8 million and $16.8 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys guarantees. Pension Plans Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2008, 2007 and 2006, excluding special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses, totaled $0.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2008, 2007 and 2006 of $9.4 million, $1.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company settled its pension obligations under a plan covering employees of the former Kentucky West Virginia Gas Company LLC, an EQT subsidiary which merged into Equitable Gathering LLC. The former Kentucky West Virginia employees transferred to Equitable Gathering LLC or Equitable Production Company. As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized pension settlement expense of approximately $8 million. An additional $1.4 million of pension settlement losses were recognized in 2008 for lump sum payments made during the normal course of plan operations. During 2007, the Company recognized a settlement expense of $0.5 million due to a plan design change for a specific union and an additional settlement expense for $0.5 million due to the transfer of some current active employees to non union employment. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a settlement expense of approximately $2.7 million for an early retirement program. 46 Table of Contents The Company made cash contributions to its pension plan of approximately $3.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.8 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of the previously described settlements. Under current law, the Company expects to make cash payments related to its pensions of approximately $15 million in 2009 which will meet the 80% funding obligations on its remaining plans. Pension contributions will be funded by cash flow from operations or by borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations, transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed. Accounting for the Companys regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 71. As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. Schedule of Contractual Obligations The following table details the undiscounted future projected payments associated with the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008. Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014+ (Thousands) Purchase obligations $ 1,973,032 $ 128,822 $ 126,076 $ 277,235 $ 1,440,899 Long term debt 1,253,500 4,300 6,000 210,000 1,033,200 Interest payments 709,328 76,709 152,860 139,657 340,102 Operating leases 186,630 32,468 46,753 16,960 90,449 Pension and other post retirement benefits 107,339 14,850 23,142 21,737 47,610 Other liabilities 19,354 19,354 Total contractual obligations $ 4,249,183 $ 257,149 $ 374,185 $ 665,589 $ 2,952,260 Purchase obligations primarily are for commitments for demand charges under existing long term contracts with pipeline suppliers as well as under binding precedent agreements. Approximately $19.4 million of these obligations each year are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the Companys drilling program. In 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with Liberty Avenue Holdings, LLC to provide office space for the Companys new corporate headquarters. The obligations for the Companys various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $132.8 million as of December 31, 2008. The Company has agreements with Highlands Drilling, LLC (Highlands) and Patterson UTI Drilling Company, LLC (Patterson) for Highlands and Patterson to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company. These obligations totaled approximately $53.8 million as of December 31, 2008. The other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program and the 2008 Executive Performance Incentive Program. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. The Company adopted the 2009 Shareholder Value Plan in December 2008 and the Company may adopt other plans in the future. The contractual obligations do not include any payments under the 2009 Shareholder Value Plan or any potential future plans. As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total FIN 48 liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 of $47.6 million. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above. 47 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Several West Virginia lessors claimed in a suit filed on July 31, 2006 that Equitable Production Company had underpaid royalties on gas produced and marketed from leases. The suit sought compensatory and punitive damages, an accounting, and other relief. The plaintiffs later amended their complaint to name Equitable Resources, Inc. as an additional defendant. While the Company believes that it paid the proper royalty, it established a reserve to cover any potential liability. The Company has settled the litigation. The settlement covers all of the Companys lessors in West Virginia and is subject to court approval. The Company believes the reserve established for royalty matters is sufficient. In the ordinary course of business, various other legal claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company has established reserves for pending litigation, which it believes are adequate, and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingent liabilities and commitments. Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon EQTs Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed and approved by the Companys Audit Committee, relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows pursuant to SFAS No. 19. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit. The depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves. The carrying values of the Companys proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. In order to determine whether impairment has occurred, the Company estimates the expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties. The estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves, utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset, market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable. Those properties would be written down to fair value, which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis. Indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors, potential 48 Table of Contents shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. If it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made. Unproved properties had a net book value of $83.5 million in 2008. There were no significant unproved properties balances at December 31, 2007 or 2006. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves, a process which can be significantly impacted by assumed market prices for oil and gas. Should the Company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities, future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Oil and Gas Reserves: Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10, are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made). The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Companys engineers and reviewed by the Companys independent engineers. Revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements. The Company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs at year end price levels. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from mark to market hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss, deferred revenues and expenses, federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. The Company also recorded a $0.2 million charge in 2008 and $0.1 million charge in 2007 and 2006 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain compensation plans, as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the IRC. No other valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. 49 Table of Contents The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes under the provisions of FIN 48. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The recognition threshold requires the Company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position in order to record any financial statement benefit. If the first step is satisfied, then the Company must measure the tax position. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed and considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. Evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Derivative Commodity Instruments: The Company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production. Under SFAS No. 133, derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge under SFAS No. 133, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. See Commodity Risk Management above and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information regarding hedging activities. The Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use as inputs market based parameters, including but not limited to forward curves, discount rates, broker quotes, volatilities, and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Companys credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterpartys credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Companys or counterpartys credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available. The values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. A substantial majority of the Companys derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be de designated, the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings, which could materially impact the results of operations. One of the requirements for hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged. Effectiveness is impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective. The 50 Table of Contents Company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads, credit ratings, credit default swap rates and market activity. In addition, the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the Company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the Company to margin requirements. Given the Companys price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are critical accounting estimates because the Companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of non performance risk, and by changes in margin requirements. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007 the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of $16.3 million and a liability of $479.5 million, respectively. Contingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The recording of contingencies is guided by the principles of SFAS No. 5. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results. In addition to the obligation to record contingent liabilities, SFAS No. 143 requires that the Company accrue a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Companys plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company increases the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value, through charges to depreciation, depletion, and amortization, and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets. The Company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems, and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Share Based Compensation: The Company awards share based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan. The Company accounts for all of its share based payment awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. The Company treats its Executive Performance Incentive Programs, including the 2008 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2008 EPIP) and the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program (2007 Supply Program) as liability awards. The actual cost to be recorded for these plans will not be known until the measurement date, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date. The Company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts. Approximately 70,000 units were granted under the 2008 EPIP. The payout of this program will be between zero and three times this number of units valued at the price of the Companys common stock at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2011. The payout multiple is dependent upon the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer groups total shareholder return and the downward discretion of the Compensation 51 Table of Contents Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company granted approximately 165,000 awards under the 2007 Supply Program. The awards earned may be increased to a maximum of three times the initial award or reduced to zero based upon achievement of the predetermined production sales revenue targets. The performance period for the 2007 Supply Program ends on December 31, 2010. Assuming no change in the current payout multiple assumptions for both programs, a 10% increase in the Companys stock price assumptions for the 2008 EPIP plan and the 2007 Supply Program would result in an increase in 2009 compensation expense under these plans of approximately $0.7 million. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted the 2009 Shareholder Value Plan (2009 SVP) in December 2008. A total of 977,600 units were granted under the plan. The payout of this award will depend on a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group and the Companys average absolute return on total capital during the performance period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009. Payout of awards will be between zero and 250% the number of units awarded at the price of the Companys common stock at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2009. Assuming a payout multiple of 175% and a 10% increase in the Companys year end stock price, the 2009 SVP plan would result in compensation expense of approximately $7.7 million in 2009. The 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan permits the grant of restricted stock awards and non qualified stock options to employees of the Company. For time restricted stock awards, compensation expense, which is based on the grant date fair value, is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The majority of the time based restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the three year period commencing with the date of grant. For non qualified stock options, compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Companys stock. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share based compensation are critical accounting estimates because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the Companys shares and the various performance factors. The impact on net income of these changes can be material and managements assumptions regarding these performance factors require significant judgment. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Commodity Instruments The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily through the EQT Production and EQT Midstream segments. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption Commodity Risk Management in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K. The Company uses non leveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. Commodity Price Risk The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in commodity prices. 52 Table of Contents For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Companys forecasted production, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels, which are exposed to price risk. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales, which are exposed to price risk, the Company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels. The Company holds an immaterial amount of derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company include futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements, which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity. The Company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. Due to the significant well development and infrastructure investment at EQT Production and EQT Midstream, the Companys overall objective in its hedging program has been to ensure an adequate level of return for these investments. To the extent that the Company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price, the Company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2008, the Company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2015 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 210.4 Bcf of natural gas. See the Commodity Risk Management in the Capital Resources and Liquidity sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K for further discussion. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2008 levels would increase the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $54.9 million. A hypothetical increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2008 levels would decrease the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $52.4 million. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal change in fair value as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at December 31, 2008. The price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Companys balance sheet, resulting in the change in fair value. The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected. If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. Other Market Risks The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value. The Company believes that NYMEX traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the Commodity Futures Trading 53 Table of Contents Commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants, including the Company, from any potential financial instability of the exchange members. The Company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the Companys criteria for credit and liquidity strength and continually monitoring counterparty risk factors. The Company utilizes various information technology systems to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures. This includes closely monitoring current market conditions, counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits. To manage the level of credit risk, the Company enters transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade, enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security. Approximately 52% , or $154.4 million, of OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 have a positive fair value. All derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2008 are with counterparties having an S&P rating of A or above at that date. In September 2008, the credit support provider of one counterparty (Lehman Brothers) declared bankruptcy resulting in a default under various derivative contracts with the Company. As a result, those contracts were terminated and a reserve of $5.2 million was recorded against the entire balance due to the Company. There is no additional income statement exposure to Lehman Brothers beyond the reserve recorded this year. As of December 31, 2008, the Company is not in default under any derivative contracts and has no knowledge of default by any other counterparty to derivative contracts. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas. A significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from EQT Production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas to certain marketers, including the Companys wholly owned marketing subsidiary Equitable Energy, and utility and industrial customers located mainly in the Appalachian area. Additionally, a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable at EQT Midstream are generated from the sale of produced natural gas liquids to a gas processor in Kentucky and gathering of natural gas in Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures on October 26, 2011. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. Lehman is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding $95 million under the facility. Lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the Company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to $1,405 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has outstanding under the facility $319.9 million of loans in support of corporate activities and a $25.8 million irrevocable standby letter of credit. No one lender in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. The Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to otherwise limit the Companys exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry. 54 Table of Contents
