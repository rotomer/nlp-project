Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations In 2009 EQT achieved record results. Highlights for 2009 included: Record annual sales of produced natural gas of 100.1 Bcfe, more than 19 % higher than 2008; Drilled 800th horizontal Huron/Berea well, approximately 27% of sales were from horizontal Huron/Berea wells; Drilled 46 horizontal Marcellus wells; Record EQT Midstream throughput and operating income; and Record Distribution operating income of $78.9 million, 32% higher than 2008. EQTs consolidated income from continuing operations for 2009 was $156.9 million, $1.19 per diluted share, compared with $255.6 million, $2.00 per diluted share, for 2008 and $257.5 million, $2.10 per diluted share, for 2007. The $98.7 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a lower average well head sales price, increased incentive compensation expense, increased depletion expense, and higher interest expense partially offset by increased gas sales volumes at EQT Production, increased gathering volumes and rate, Big Sandy pipeline activity and NGLs sold at EQT Midstream and an increase in base rates in the Distribution segment. Incentive compensation expense increased from 2008 to 2009 as a result of expenses related to the Companys 2009 Shareholder Value Plan recorded in 2009 and a reversal of previously recorded expense on the Companys 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program in 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in the Companys stock price in 2008. Incentive compensation is primarily reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Statements of Consolidated Income. A significant portion of the 2009 expense and 2008 reversal are reported as unallocated expenses in the information by business segment in Note 2 of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 Table of Contents Interest expense increased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the Companys continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2009. This investment was partially funded by the issuance of $700 million of 8.125% notes in May 2009. The $1.9 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2007 to 2008 reflects an increase in operating income of $153.1 million which was more than offset by the absence of a 2007 pre tax gain of $126.1 million on the sale of assets in the Nora area, higher 2008 interest and income taxes and a 2008 other than temporary impairment loss on available for sale securities. Operating income for 2008 was impacted by decreased incentive compensation expense, increased production revenues due to higher average well head sales prices and significantly higher volumes, increased gathering and transmission revenues due to higher rates and volumes, and the absence of 2007 transaction costs associated with the terminated Peoples and Hope acquisition. The decreased incentive compensation expense was the result of the reversal of previously recorded expense on the Companys 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program partially offset by increased short term incentive compensation. These items were partially offset by increased depletion, depreciation and amortization, increased operating and administrative expenses and the impact of the May 2007 asset sales. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income. Interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive expenses (income) and administrative expenses totaling $62.2 million, ($17.4) million and $65.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were not allocated to business segments. The unallocated expense in 2009 and 2007 primarily relates to performance related incentive expenses, while the unallocated income in 2008 primarily relates to the reversal of previously recorded performance related incentive expenses. The Company has reconciled each segments operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income totals in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQTs management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQTs segments without being obscured by these items for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. EQT Production Overview Driven by aggressive horizontal air drilling in the Huron/Berea play, EQT Production achieved sales of produced natural gas of 100.1 Bcfe in 2009, representing a more than 19% increase. Also, unit LOE, excluding production taxes, decreased 14% in 2009 to $0.30 per Mcfe. EQT Productions strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing the Companys extensive acreage position through organic growth enabled by a low cost structure. The Company is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program and believes that it is a technological leader in drilling in low pressure shale. In particular, the use of air in horizontal drilling has proven to be a cost effective technology which the Company has efficiently deployed to various geological formations in the 25 Table of Contents Appalachian Basin mountain terrain and which may be deployed to other Company assets in the Appalachian Basin to maximize production. In 2009, extended laterals utilizing this technology produced a 6,700 foot lateral with 6,000 feet of pay, essentially doubling the typical horizontal well which is a 3,700 foot with 3,000 feet of pay. Based on these favorable preliminary results, the Company is in the process of incorporating extended lateral wells into its preferred standard operating procedures for the Huron/Berea play. The Company expects to access significantly more reserves through the extended lateral drilling procedures for less than a proportional amount of the development costs. In 2009, the Company drilled 434 gross wells in the Huron/Berea play. Total proved reserves in the Huron/Berea play (including vertical non shale formations) are 2.8 Tcfe. In the Marcellus play, the Company drilled 50 gross wells during 2009. Total proved reserves in the Marcellus play increased 1,278% to 1.1 Tcfe. Proved reserves increased in the Marcellus and Huron/Berea plays as a result of the Companys 2009 drilling program. In addition, the application of new SEC oil and gas reporting rules permitted the booking of PUDs in locations more than one offset location away from existing wells. The Company drilled 218 gross CBM wells in 2009. The CBM play had total proved reserves of 0.2 Tcfe at December 31, 2009, down 6% from 2008 as a result of the implementation of the new SEC oil and gas reporting rules. See Item 2 Properties for additional discussion of the Companys proved reserves and the impact of the new SEC oil and gas reporting rules. Sales of produced natural gas in 2009 from the Huron/Berea, Marcellus and CBM plays were 84.9 Bcfe, 2.9 Bcfe and 12.3 Bcfe, respectively. EQT Productions revenues for 2009 decreased approximately 16% compared to 2008 revenues. The average well head sales price decreased approximately 30%, as a result of decreased commodity market prices offset by slightly higher hedge prices year over year. Gas sales volumes increased more than 19% from 2008 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2008 and 2009 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys producing wells. Operating expenses at EQT Production included an $8.8 million increase in the Companys exploration program. The increase in exploration expense is primarily a result of the Companys initiative to explore additional reserve opportunities in various exploration plays on its legacy acreage position with the purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties. In addition, in 2009, EQT Production recorded a $2.9 million impairment charge associated with the write off of the Utica exploratory well when the Company made the decision to abandon the Utica formation and plug back the well to the Marcellus formation. Excluding exploration expenses, 2009 operating expenses increased 10% primarily due to higher depletion resulting from increased drilling investments. See Investing Activities in Capital Resources and Liquidity for a discussion of capital expenditures. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % change 2009 2008 2007 % change 2008 2007 OPERATIONAL DATA Production: Natural gas and oil production (MMcfe) (a) 104,928 90,585 15.8 83,114 9.0 Company usage, line loss (MMcfe) (4,828 ) (6,577 ) (26.6 ) (6,035 ) 9.0 Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 100,100 84,008 19.2 77,079 9.0 Average (well head) sales price ($/Mcfe) (b) $ 3.75 $ 5.32 (29.5 ) $ 4.59 15.9 Lease operating expenses (LOE), excluding production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.30 $ 0.35 (14.3 ) $ 0.31 12.9 Production taxes ($/Mcfe) $ 0.29 $ 0.52 (44.2 ) $ 0.43 20.9 Production depletion ($/Mcfe) $ 1.06 $ 0.81 (30.9 ) $ 0.70 15.7 Production depletion (thousands) $ 111,371 $ 73,362 51.8 $ 58,264 25.9 Other depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (thousands) 6,053 4,872 24.2 3,820 27.5 Total DD&A (thousands) $ 117,424 $ 78,234 50.1 $ 62,084 26.0 Capital expenditures (thousands) (c) $ 717,356 $ 700,745 2.4 $ 328,080 113.6 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 384,576 $ 457,144 (15.9 ) $ 364,396 25.5 Operating expenses: LOE, excluding production taxes 31,228 31,719 (1.5 ) 25,361 25.1 Production taxes (d) 30,123 47,158 (36.1 ) 36,123 30.5 Exploration expense 17,905 9,064 97.5 862 951.5 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 36,815 38,185 (3.6 ) 37,947 0.6 DD&A 117,424 78,234 50.1 62,084 26.0 Total operating expenses 233,495 204,360 14.3 162,377 25.9 Gain on sale of assets, net 129,206 (100.0 ) Operating income $ 151,081 $ 252,784 (40.2 ) $ 331,225 (23.7 ) (a) Natural gas and oil production represents the Companys interest in gas and oil production measured at the well head.

(d) Production taxes include severance and production related ad valorem and other property taxes. 27 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. December 31, 2008 EQT Productions operating income totaled $151.1 million for 2009 compared to $252.8 million for 2008, a decrease of $101.7 million between years, primarily due to a lower average well head sales price and an increase in depletion expenses partially offset by increased gas sales volumes. Total operating revenues were $384.6 million for 2009 compared to $457.1 million for 2008. The decrease in operating revenues was due to lower realized prices which more than offset increased sales volumes. The average well head sales price decreased by $1.57 per Mcfe, primarily as a result of a decrease in NYMEX natural gas prices and a lower percentage of hedged gas sales, partially offset by a higher realized hedge price. The decrease in prices was partially offset by increased sales volumes of more than 19% as a result of the 2008 and 2009 drilling programs, net of the normal production decline in the Companys wells and a decrease in Company usage and line loss. Operating expenses totaled $233.5 million for 2009 compared to $204.4 million for 2008. The $29.1 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of $39.2 million in DD&A partially offset by decreases of $17.0 million in production taxes, $1.4 million in SG&A, and $0.5 million in LOE. In addition, 2009 includes an $8.8 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the Companys examination of emerging plays and the impairment charge on the exploratory Utica well. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate ($26.3 million) and volume ($11.0 million). The $0.25 per Mcfe increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The decrease in production taxes was primarily due to an $18.4 million decrease in severance taxes partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in property taxes. The decrease in severance taxes (a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted) was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices partially offset by higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes. The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years, as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the Companys wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for certain legal disputes partially offset by higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the Company, increased franchise and gross receipts taxes attributable to increased receipts and costs associated with the amendment of a contract to secure capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water. The decrease in LOE was primarily attributable to the 2008 program to test the re fracturing of existing wells. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. December 31, 2007 EQT Productions operating income totaled $252.8 million for 2008 compared to $331.2 million for 2007, a decrease of $78.4 million between years, primarily due to the absence of a 2007 gain on the sale of a portion of the Companys interests in certain gas properties in the Nora area compared to 2008 results which included higher average well head sales price and increased gas sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Total operating revenues were $457.1 million for 2008 compared to $364.4 million for 2007. The $92.7 million increase in operating revenues was due to higher realized prices and increased sales volumes. The average well head sales price increased by $0.73 per Mcfe, primarily as a result of an increase in NYMEX natural gas prices and a higher percentage of unhedged gas sales, partially offset by a lower realized hedge price. Additionally, sales volumes increased 12% excluding the 2007 sale of interests which provided sales of 1,966 MMcfe during 2007, as a result of the 2008 and 2007 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the Companys wells. Operating expenses totaled $204.4 million for 2008 compared to $162.4 million for 2007. The $42.0 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of $16.2 million in DD&A, $11.0 million in production taxes, $6.4 million in LOE, and $0.2 million in SG&A. In addition, the 2008 period included an $8.2 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the Companys examination of emerging plays. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate ($9.9 million) and volume ($5.0 million). The $0.11 increase in the depletion rate was primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The increase in production taxes was primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in severance taxes and a $1.2 million increase in property taxes. The increase in severance taxes (a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted) was 28 Table of Contents primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes. The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years, as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the Companys wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The increase in LOE was attributable to personnel costs, the 2008 program to test the re fracturing of existing wells, salt water and waste disposal, environmental costs and road and location maintenance. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the Company partially offset by lower charges for certain legal disputes in 2008 compared to 2007. On April 13, 2007, the Company and Range Resources Corporation (Range) agreed to a development plan for the Nora area in southwestern Virginia. The Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Pine Mountain Oil and Gas, Inc. (PMOG), a subsidiary of Range, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to PMOG a portion of the Companys interests in certain gas properties in the Nora area. As a result of this transaction, EQT Production recognized a net gain of $129.2 million in earnings in 2007. The net gain includes a gain on the sale of working interest in oil and gas properties under the Purchase Agreement of $157.6 million offset by a hedge loss of $28.4 million resulting from a 7.3 Bcf reduction in the Companys hedge position due to the sale of properties. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to this transaction. Outlook EQT Productions business strategy is focused on organic growth of the Companys natural gas reserves and sales volumes. Key elements of EQT Productions strategy include: Expanding production and developed reserves through horizontal drilling in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The Company is committed to expanding its production and developed reserves through horizontal drilling in its existing plays. The Company will seek to maximize the value of its existing asset base by developing its large acreage position, which the Company believes holds significant production and reserve growth potential. A substantial portion of the Companys 2010 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Additionally, based on favorable preliminary results, the Company is in the process of incorporating extended lateral wells into its preferred standard operating procedures for the Huron/Berea play. The Company expects to access significantly more reserves through the extended lateral drilling procedures for less than a proportional amount of the development costs. Sales of produced natural gas in 2010 are projected to be 20% higher than the 2009 produced gas sales. Maintaining flexibility in a low price environment The pace at which the Company is able to grow production and reserves is impacted by drilling success and the price for natural gas. The Company has mitigated some of the commodity price risk by hedging a portion of its production. The Company believes that its position as a low cost operator allows for the development of reserves and production in a low price environment. Geological and geophysical expenditures In 2010, the Company plans to spend $10.5 million on seismic data to determine optimal placement for future Marcellus wells and $1.5 million on 2D and 3D seismic data over properties in which the Company holds deeper exploration and drilling rights. Growing acreage position The Company is focused on expanding production, primarily through organic development of its large acreage position. The Company may also take advantage of property acquisition opportunities as economic conditions warrant. 29 Table of Contents EQT Midstream Overview In 2009 EQT Midstream achieved record throughput and operating income primarily due to revenues generated by new infrastructure projects exceeding the increased costs required to operate these assets. Projects completed in 2008 that positively impacted 2009 earnings include: the Kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant and gas compression facilities (Kentucky Hydrocarbon) which have the capacity to process 170 MMcfe of natural gas per day; the Mayking Corridor project (Mayking) which consists of three compressor units and 38 miles of pipe; and the Big Sandy Pipeline which currently provides 130,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity. In 2009, EQT Midstream continued optimizing existing capacity by building gathering lines to tie in wells in Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The combination of these 2009 investments with the Kentucky Hydrocarbon, Mayking and the Big Sandy Pipeline provided the platform for sales growth and will help to mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the Companys gathering systems in transporting gas to market. EQT Midstreams net operating revenues increased by 27% from 2008 to 2009. This increase was primarily due to increases in gathered volumes due to our infrastructure expansion, increased processing volumes as a result of the Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant being operational for a full year in 2009 and transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline. Increases in net operating revenues were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. EQT Energy, the Companys gas marketing affiliate, executed a binding precedent agreement with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (TGP), a wholly owned subsidiary of El Paso Corporation, for a 15 year term that awarded the Company 300,000 Dth per day of capacity in TGPs 300 Line expansion project. In July 2009, the parties amended the binding precedent agreement and EQT Energys capacity in the project was increased to 350,000 Dth per day beginning in November 2011. The awarded capacity will provide EQT access to consumer markets from the Gulf Coast to the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast.

The $54.2 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased gathering and processing volumes, gathering rates and increased Big Sandy pipeline activity, partially offset by increases in O&M and D&A expense. Total net operating revenues were $386.2 million for 2009 compared to $303.3 million for 2008. The $82.9 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $25.4 million increase in gathering net operating revenues, a $22.2 million increase in processing net operating revenues, a $25.2 million increase in transmission net operating revenues, and a $10.1 million increase in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues. Gathering net operating revenues increased due to an 11% increase in gathered volumes as well as a 6% increase in the average gathering fee. This increase was driven by more volumes gathered for EQT Production, as well as increased third party customer volume due to increased available capacity with Mayking and the Big Sandy Pipeline being operational for a full year in 2009. Processing net revenues increased primarily due to a 55% increase in NGLs sold. This resulted from increased production volumes from both EQT Production and third party customers and the expansion of the Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant and gas compression facilities in the second half of 2008. Although the average NGL sales price decreased more than 35% from 2008, the impact on processing net operating revenues was not significant due to a decrease in the related cost of natural gas processed. Transmission net revenues in 2009 increased from the prior year primarily due to increased capacity from the Big Sandy pipeline, which came on line in the second quarter of 2008. The increase in storage and marketing net revenues was primarily due to increased third party marketing that utilized Big Sandy Pipeline capacity. Total operating revenues decreased by $137.9 million, or 20%, primarily as a result of lower sales prices on decreased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets and lower NGL sales prices partially offset by an increase in gathering and processing volumes, gathering rates and increased transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline. Total purchased gas costs decreased 58% as a result of lower gas costs on 32 Table of Contents decreased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets and lower gas costs related to processing activities. Operating expenses totaled $197.2 million for 2009 compared to $168.6 million for 2008. The increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $12.2 million in O&M and $18.5 million in D&A, offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in SG&A. The increase in O&M resulted mainly from higher electricity, labor, non income taxes and compressor maintenance expenses for the gathering and processing business due to new compressors and processing facilities put in operation in the second half of 2008, partially offset by a decrease of $9.5 million relating to pension and other post retirement benefit charges recorded in 2008. The increase in D&A was primarily due to the increased investment in infrastructure during 2008 and 2009. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to expenses in 2008 which were not incurred in 2009, including a $5.2 million reserve against Lehman Brothers receivables and $1.2 million for legal and actuarial services associated with the pension and other post retirement benefit charges, partially offset by an increase in labor and services to support the growth in the Midstream business during 2009. Other income represents allowance for equity funds used during construction. The $4.3 million decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily caused by AFUDC recorded on the construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline in 2008. AFUDC was no longer recorded once Big Sandy was placed into service in the second quarter of 2008. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled $6.4 million for 2009 compared to $5.1 million for 2008. This increase is related to equity earnings recorded for EQT Midstreams investment in Nora Gathering, LLC, which was formed in May 2007. Earnings increased in 2009 as a result of higher net income for Nora Gathering, LLC in 2009 compared to 2008. The higher net income was driven by increases in the average gathering fee and gathered volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses for the Nora operations in 2009. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. December 31, 2007 EQT Midstreams operating income totaled $134.8 million for 2008 compared to $137.3 million for 2007, a decrease of $2.5 million. An increase in net operating revenues was more than offset by increased operating expenses, including a $10.7 million settlement charge for pension and post retirement benefits including related severance and legal fees and $5.2 million bad debt expense as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. This was partially offset by a loss of $3.1 resulting from the contribution of gathering assets to Nora LLC, an entity formed in 2007 that is equally owned by the Company and Pine Mountain Oil and Gas, Inc. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction. Excluding these items, operating income increased 7%. Total net operating revenues were $303.3 million for 2008 compared to $261.9 million for 2007. The $41.4 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $20.7 million increase in gathering net operating revenues, a $15.1 million increase in transmission net operating revenues, a $5.3 million increase in processing net operating revenues and a $0.3 million increase in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues. The increase in gathering net operating revenues was due to a 17% increase in the average gathering fee and a small increase in gathered volumes. The increase in the average gathering fee is reflective of the Companys commitment to ensuring that this fee is sufficient to cover costs associated with infrastructure expansion. Gathered volumes increased 1% due to the increase in 2008 Company production and third party volumes which were partially offset by the elimination in 2008 of volumes gathered on assets contributed to Nora Gathering, LLC. The increase in processing net operating revenues was due to an increase in NGLs sold as well as increased commodity prices for propane and other NGLs. The volume of NGLs sold increased in 2008 as a result of the Companys infrastructure investments. The increase in transmission net operating revenues was due to new transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline, which came on line in the second quarter of 2008 while storage, marketing and other net operating revenues increased mainly from third party marketing that utilized Big Sandy Pipeline capacity. Total operating revenues increased by $89.9 million, or 15%, primarily as a result of higher sales prices on increased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets, an increase in processing volumes and commodity prices, higher gathering rates and new transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline. 33 Table of Contents Total purchased gas costs increased due to the higher gas costs on increased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets as well as higher gas costs related to processing activities. Operating expenses totaled $168.6 million for 2008 compared to $121.5 million for 2007. The $47.1 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $20.2 million in SG&A, $18.4 million in O&M, and $8.5 million in D&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to labor and services to support the growth in the Midstream business, a $5.2 million reserve against Lehman Brothers receivables, and $1.2 million for legal and actuarial services associated with the pension and other post retirement charge, partially offset by decreased SG&A for the gathering assets contributed to Nora Gathering, LLC. The increase in O&M resulted mainly from the $9.5 million pension and other post retirement charge as well as increased electricity charges, compressor maintenance, labor and non income taxes for the gathering and processing business due to new compressors and processing facilities, partially offset by the expenses associated with gathering asset contributed to Nora Gathering, LLC. The increase in D&A was primarily due to the increased investment in infrastructure during 2008, partially offset by decreased depreciation relating to the gathering asset contribution to Nora Gathering, LLC. Other income represents allowance for equity funds used during construction. The $1.6 million decrease from 2007 to 2008 was primarily caused by a full year of AFUDC on Big Sandy recorded in 2007, as compared to only a partial year in 2008 as Big Sandy was placed on line in the second quarter of 2008. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled $5.1 million for 2008 compared to $2.6 million for 2007. This increase is related to equity earnings recorded for EQT Midstreams investment in Nora Gathering, LLC, which was formed in May 2007. Outlook EQT Midstreams long term focus is to take advantage of its infrastructure asset position in the heart of the Marcellus shale play in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The Equitrans Marcellus Expansion Project is expected to provide Appalachian producers with timely, cost effective options to reach Northeastern and Mid Atlantic markets as well as storage by expanding Equitrans existing asset base. Equitrans plans to create new firm transportation capacity through the addition of pipeline looping, new high pressure laterals and compression facilities on Equitrans existing pipeline network. EQT Midstream successfully completed an open season for a proposed expansion of the Equitrans pipeline with total capacity demand indicated in the open season in excess of 1,100,000 Dth per day. The next steps are to secure firm precedent agreements with shippers and obtain FERC approval. Gathering, processing and transmission revenues are expected to increase as EQT Midstream expands its infrastructure to support EQT Production growth in the Huron/Berea and Marcellus plays. 34 Table of Contents Equitable Distribution Overview Distributions business strategy is to earn a competitive return on its asset base through operational efficiency and innovative regulatory mechanisms. Distribution is focused on enhancing the value of its existing assets by establishing a reputation for excellent customer service, effectively managing its capital spending, improving the efficiency of its workforce and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations. Equitable Gas continues to focus on improved customer service. In 2009, Equitable Gas launched a new website giving customers the ability to view and pay bills on line and providing customers with a Home Energy Analyzer that enables them to easily examine their energy use factoring in weather, appliance and electronics usage and the type of construction used in their home. These and other efforts, including improved operating performance at Equitable Gass customer call center, have resulted in increased overall customer satisfaction. On February 26, 2009, the PA PUC approved a settlement between Equitable Gas and the active parties to the filing for a base rate case increase in Pennsylvania. The Company implemented the new base rates upon approval of the settlement. Pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist low income customers with paying their gas bills. The costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers. Equitable Gas has several such programs, including the customer assistance program (CAP). As part of the rate case settlement, the Company received approval to increase the CAP surcharge in order to recover its costs for assisting low income customers with paying their gas bills. In addition, the CAP costs will be reconciled annually to ensure complete recovery of these costs in the future. Distributions net operating revenues increased 5% from 2008 to 2009 due to the increase in base rates. The weather in Equitable Gas service territory in 2009 was 3% warmer than 2008 and 6% warmer than the 30 year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration average. The weather in 2008 was 4% warmer than the 30 year average. Total operating expenses decreased 9% from 2008, primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower overhead costs in 2009. See Investing Activities in Capital Resources and Liquidity for a discussion of capital expenditures. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % change 2009 2008 2007 % change 2008 2007 OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,829) 5,474 5,622 (2.6) 5,332 5.4 Residential sales and transportation volume (MMcf) 23,098 23,824 (3.0) 23,494 1.4 Commercial and industrial volume (MMcf) 30,521 27,503 11.0 25,971 5.9 Total throughput (MMcf) 53,619 51,327 4.5 49,465 3.8 Net operating revenues (thousands): Residential $ 111,007 $ 105,059 5.7 $ 99,050 6.1 Commercial & industrial 47,432 46,394 2.2 42,558 9.0 Off system and energy services 21,545 19,415 11.0 19,021 2.1 Total net operating revenues 179,984 170,868 5.3 $ 160,629 6.4 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 33,707 $ 45,770 (26.4) $ 41,684 9.8 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 560,283 $ 698,385 (19.8) $ 624,744 11.8 Purchased gas costs 380,299 527,517 (27.9) 464,115 13.7 Net operating revenues 179,984 170,868 5.3 160,629 6.4 Operating expenses: O & M 43,663 44,161 (1.1) 41,613 6.1 SG&A 35,028 44,793 (21.8) 64,454 (30.5) DD&A 22,375 22,055 1.5 20,021 10.2 Total operating expenses 101,066 111,009 (9.0) 126,088 (12.0) Operating income $ 78,918 $ 59,859 31.8 $ 34,541 73.3 Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. December 31, 2008 Distributions operating income totaled $78.9 million for 2009 compared to $59.9 million for 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in base rates and lower operating expenses. Net operating revenues were $180.0 million for 2009 compared to $170.9 million for 2008. The $9.1 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily the result of the approval of the Companys base rate increase in 2009. Net revenues from residential customers increased $5.9 million as a result of an increase in base rates which was partially offset by the absence of a 2008 non recurring increase in customer assistance program activities, as well as customer conservation and slightly warmer weather. Off system and energy services net operating revenues increased $2.1 million due to higher revenues from gathering activities resulting primarily from increased rates. Commercial and industrial net revenues increased $1.0 million due to higher base rates and an increase in usage by one industrial customer, partially offset by lower performance based revenues. The high volume sales from the industrial customer have low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. A decrease in gas costs associated with asset optimization transactions and a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates resulted in a decrease in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs. 36 Table of Contents Operating expenses totaled $101.1 million for 2009 compared to $111.0 million for 2008. The $9.9 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of lower bad debt, general overhead and labor and fringe benefit expenses in 2009 and the absence of the holding company reorganization costs that were incurred in 2008. The reduction in bad debt expense from 2008 to 2009 was the result of favorable adjustments in the allowance for uncollectible accounts in 2009 due to increased customer participation in programs assisting low income customers in paying their bills, the recovery of CAP costs associated with the approval of the rate case settlement and a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in accruals for certain non income tax reserves and an increase in incentive compensation costs. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. December 31, 2007 Distributions operating income totaled $59.9 million for 2008 compared to $34.5 million for 2007. The $25.4 million increase in operating income was primarily due to a non recurring increase in customer assistance program activities, colder weather and lower SG&A expenses due to the absence in 2008 of costs associated with the now terminated Peoples and Hope acquisition. Net operating revenues were $170.9 million for 2008 compared to $160.6 million for 2007. The $10.3 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily a result of an increase in both residential and commercial and industrial net operating revenues. The $6.0 million increase in residential net operating revenues was primarily the result of an increase in customer assistance program activities. Additionally, 2008 weather was 5% colder than the prior year. Commercial and industrial revenues increased $3.8 million due to an increase in performance based revenues as well as increased volumes of 1,532 MMcf from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to an increase in usage by one industrial customer. The high volume sales from the industrial customer have low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. Off system and energy services net operating revenues increased due to increased gathering revenue as a result of increased volumes and rates, partially offset by lower volumes and margins in asset optimization activities. Additionally, an increase in the commodity component of residential tariff rates resulted in an increase in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs. Operating expenses totaled $111.0 million for 2008 compared to $126.1 million for 2007. This $15.1 million decrease was primarily due to the impact of $21.0 million in 2007 costs related to the now terminated Peoples and Hope acquisition, a decrease in incentive compensation expenses and a reduction in insurance reserves due to increased safety measures. Partially offsetting these decreases were an increase in customer assistance expenses resulting from a significant increase in customer participation in the CAP and an increase in operating expenses primarily related to increased leak repair and maintenance activities for gathering operations, service line maintenance and line location requests and higher gas prices. Additionally, there was a $2.1 million increase in depreciation due to an adjustment in asset estimated useful lives resulting from the PA PUC mandated asset service life study as well as increased capital expenditures. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Peoples and Hope transaction. Outlook Distribution will continue to execute its strategy of earning a competitive return on its asset base through operational efficiency and regulatory mechanisms. Distribution is focused on enhancing the value of its existing assets by improving the efficiency of its workforce, establishing a reputation for excellent customer service, effectively managing its capital spending and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations. Distribution will also seek out growth opportunities for the sale of natural gas through new outlets such as natural gas vehicles while promoting customer conservation and efficiency. On October 29, 2009, Equitable Gas filed a request with the WV PSC to increase the rates it charges its approximately 13,000 customers for delivery of natural gas in West Virginia. It is the first delivery rate increase that Equitable Gas has requested in West Virginia since 1991. The proposed increase, which totals approximately $3 million annually, is subject to WV PSC review and is expected to increase residential gas bills by approximately 18% per month. Equitable Gas expects the rate case proceeding to be resolved no later than the third quarter of 2010. 37 Table of Contents Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Thousands) Other income $ 2,076 $ 6,233 $ 7,645 Other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities (7,835) Gain on sale of available for sale securities, net 1,042 In 2009, 2008 and 2007, other income primarily relates to the equity portion of AFUDC on various projects. In 2007, the Company made a substantial investment in the construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline, which was completed in the second quarter of 2008. Completion of the project reduced AFUDC in 2008 as a full year of AFUDC on Big Sandy was recorded in 2007, only a partial year in 2008. The substantial decrease in other income in 2009 reflects reduced value of projects subject to AFUDC. As discussed in Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Companys available for sale investments consist of equity and bond funds intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the Company self insures. At December 31, 2008, these investments had a fair market value which was $7.8 million below cost. The Company analyzed the decline in these investments based on the extent and duration of the impairment and the nature of the underlying assets. Although the Company holds these investments to fund long term liabilities, based on the extent and duration of the impairment, combined with then current market conditions, the Company concluded that the decline was other than temporary. As such, the Company recognized a $7.8 million impairment in earnings in 2008. In 2007, the Company reviewed its investment portfolio (including its investment allocation) and sold equity funds with a cost basis of $6.3 million for total proceeds of $7.3 million, resulting in the Company recognizing a gain of $1.0 million. Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, &nbsp ; 2009 2008 2007 (Thousands) Interest expense $111,779 $58,394 $47,669 Interest expense increased by $53.4 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the Companys continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2009. This investment was partially funded by the issuance of $700 million of 8.125% notes in May 2009. The interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 2.8% decrease in the average short term interest rate during 2009. Interest expense increased by $10.7 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the Companys investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2007 and 2008. This investment was partially funded by the issuance of $500 million of 6.5% notes in March 2008. The interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in the average short term interest rate during 2008. Weighted average annual interest rates on the Companys long term debt were 6.5%, 6.1% and 5.9% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Weighted average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 0.7%, 3.5% and 5.8% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Income Taxes Years Ended December 31, &nbsp ; 2009 2008 2007 (Thousands) Income Taxes $96,668 $154,920 $144,395 Income tax expense decreased by $58.3 million from 2008 to 2009 despite a higher effective tax rate as a result of lower pre tax income. During 2009, the Companys effective income tax rate increased from 37.7% to 38.1%. The higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily the result of nondeductible compensation expense partially offset by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes. The Company recorded a tax benefit in 2008 for a change in the West Virginia state tax law that primarily provides for a reduction in future corporate income tax rates which was partially offset by additional tax expense recorded as a result of the completion of the IRS audit through the 2005 tax year. Income tax expense increased by $10.5 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the increase in the Companys effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2008 was 37.7% compared to 35.9% in 2007. The higher effective tax rate in 2008 is the result of several factors including the Company being in a net operating loss position for tax purposes in 2008 which resulted in the loss of certain deductions for 2008 and for prior years as a result of carrying losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid. In addition, state taxes increased as a result of limitations imposed on certain state tax losses generated in 2008. The Company recorded a net increase to tax expense in 2008 as a result of the completion of its IRS audit through the 2005 tax year, partially offset by a beneficial change in the West Virginia state tax law. The Company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss position for 2008 and 2009 and expects to pay minimal federal income taxes for as long as the Companys drilling program in Appalachia continues, unless tax laws change. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently deducts approximately 75% of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (IDC) in the year incurred. The primary reasons for the Companys net operating loss are the IDC deduction resulting from the Companys drilling program and the accelerated tax deprecation for expansion of gathering infrastructure which provide tax deductions in excess of book deductions. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview The Companys primary sources of cash during 2009 were cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from a public offering of Senior Notes. The Company used the proceeds from the public offering primarily to fund its capital spending program and repay short term borrowings. Operating Activities The Companys net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was $725.7 million compared to $509.2 million for the same period of 2008. EQT received an income tax refund of $115.2 million from the IRS in 2009 relating to the 2008 net operating loss carryback claims that were filed with the IRS in 2009. The remaining increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily the result of lower inventory, accounts receivable, unbilled revenues and margin deposits. These were partially offset by a corresponding decrease in accounts payable at December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased to $509.2 million in 2008 from $426.7 million in 2007. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a net cash refund related to income taxes of $14.0 million in 2008 compared to a net cash payment of $63.4 million in 2007. For federal income tax purposes the Company currently deducts approximately 75% of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (IDC) in the year incurred. The IDC deduction resulting from its drilling program coupled with accelerated tax depreciation for expansion of the gathering infrastructure put the Company into an overall federal tax net operating 39 Table of Contents loss position in 2008. Unless the IDC related tax law changes, this tax position is likely to continue so long as the Companys drilling program in Appalachia continues. As such, the Company expects minimal federal cash taxes for the foreseeable future. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $985.5 million for 2009 as compared to $1,376.0 million for 2008, a net decrease of $390.5 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following: a decrease in capital expenditures to $963.9 million in 2009 from $1,344.0 million in 2008. See discussion of capital expenditures below; a decrease in capital contributions to Nora Gathering, LLC for use in midstream infrastructure projects to $6.4 million in 2009 from $29.0 million in 2008; Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1,376.0 million for 2008 as compared to $590.1 million for 2007, a net increase of $785.9 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following: an increase in capital expenditures to $1,344.0 million in 2008 from $776.7 million in 2007. See discussion of capital expenditures below; capital contributions of $29.0 million to Nora Gathering, LLC in 2008 for use in midstream infrastructure projects; the absence in 2008 of proceeds of $217.0 million received in 2007 from the sale and contribution of assets. See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Expenditures 2010 Plan 2009 Actual 2008 Actual 2007 Actual Well development (primarily drilling) $ 565 million $ 717 million $ 701 million $ 328 million* Midstream infrastructure $ 245 million $ 201 million $ 594 million $ 434 million* Distribution infrastructure and other corporate items $ 40 million $ 46 million $ 49 million $ 43 million Total $ 850 million $ 964 million $ 1,344 million $ 805 million * Includes $24.4 million and $3.7 million, in the well development and Midstream infrastructure categories, respectively, for the acquisition of additional working interest and related gathering assets in the Roaring Fork area. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is committed to profitably expanding its production and reserves through horizontal drilling, exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays and expanding its infrastructure in the Appalachian Basin with the Equitrans Marcellus Expansion Project. Capital expenditures for 2010 will be concentrated on drilling in areas that already benefit from the Companys substantial Appalachian midstream infrastructure in the Huron/Berea play. The Companys planned 2010 capital expenditures are designed to achieve annual gas sales volume growth of 20% in 2010, without requiring access to the capital markets. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to finance its planned capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities as well as a portion of the Companys $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. 40 Table of Contents Capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $717 million and $701 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company drilled 702 gross wells (536 net wells) in 2009, 434 Huron/Berea wells, 50 Marcellus wells and 218 CBM wells, compared to 668 gross wells (533 net wells) in 2008, including 484 Huron/Berea wells, 23 Marcellus wells and 161 CBM wells. Capital expenditures for 2009 also included $31.0 million for undeveloped property acquisitions, primarily within the Marcellus play. Capital expenditures for 2008 included $85.5 million for undeveloped property acquisitions. Capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled $201 million for 2009. EQT Midstream turned in line 274 miles of pipeline and 21,850 horse power of compression primarily within the Huron/Berea play. During 2008, Midstream capital expenditures were $594 million and included costs associated with gathering pipeline and compression, including the Mayking corridor, and the construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline and Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant upgrade, both of which were completed in 2008. Capital expenditures at Distribution totaled $34 million and $46 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively, principally for pipeline replacement and metering. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to reduced gathering related infrastructure spending in 2009 as compared to 2008. Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $259.8 million for 2009 as compared to $785.1 million for 2008. During 2009, the Company received $700 million from the public sale of 8.125% Senior Notes due June 1, 2019. By comparison, during 2008, the Company received $560.7 million from the public sale of 8.625 million shares of common stock and $500 million from the public sale of 6.50% Senior Notes due April 1, 2018. A portion of the 2009 and 2008 debt offerings were used to repay short term borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility during the periods. The Company repaid $314.9 million in short term borrowing during 2009 and $130.1 million in short term borrowings during the same period in 2008. The Company also repaid $4.3 million in long term debt during 2009. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $785.1 million for 2008 as compared to $245.1 million for 2007. The increase was attributable largely to the 2008 equity and debt offerings. Short term Borrowings Cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices. In addition to funding working capital requirements, which are significantly impacted by seasonality, the Company utilizes short term borrowings to fund any required margin deposit until the underlying transactions are settled or the deposits are returned and to finance capital expenditures until they can be permanently financed. The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures on October 26, 2011. The facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other purposes including support of a commercial paper program. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman) is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding $95 million under the facility. Lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the Company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to $1,405 million. Otherwise, the Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the Companys exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding under the revolving credit facility loans of $5.0 million in support of corporate purposes and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of $24.4 million. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys short term borrowings was 0.7% for 2009. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility fluctuates with the LIBOR rate. The Companys short term borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less. 41 Table of Contents Security Ratings and Financing Triggers The table below reflects the credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the Company at December 31, 2009. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Companys cost of short term and long term debt and its access to the credit markets. Unsecured Medium Term Commercial Rating Service Notes Paper Fitch Ratings Service BBB+ F 2 Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB A 2 On February 17, 2010, Standard & Poors Ratings services (S&P) affirmed its ratings on EQT. At the same time, S&P revised its outlook to negative and lowered the short term rating to A 3 citing the Companys growth in its exploration and production and midstream businesses. On March 9, 2009, Moodys reaffirmed its ratings on EQT. The Outlook is negative. Moodys stated that the ratings reflect the diversification and vertical integration among its three business segments as well as the Baa stand alone quality of both its E&P and LDC operations. On March 20, 2009, Fitch announced initial ratings for EQT stating that the ratings are supported by the stability and predictability of cash flows from its midstream and gas distribution businesses and the quality of its exploration and production (E&P) segment, which focuses on natural gas production in the Appalachian Basin. The Companys credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the credit rating agencies downgrade the Companys ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Companys access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs and margin deposits on derivative contracts could increase, counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. The required margin is subject to significant change as a result of other factors besides credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. The Companys debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. The most significant default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Companys current credit facilitys financial covenants require a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2009, the Company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. Commodity Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Companys risk management program includes the use of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts and options and OTC natural gas swap agreements and options (collectively, derivative commodity instruments) to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily fixed price swaps, collars and options. 42 Table of Contents The approximate volumes and prices of the Companys total hedge position for 2010 through 2012 production are: 2010 2011 2012 Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 23 19 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 5.12 $ 5.10 $ Puts Total Volume (Bcf) 3 3 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 7.35 $ 7.35 $ Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 17 14 14 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 7.28 $ 7.11 $ 7.11 Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 14.05 $ 14.12 $ 14.07 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf The Companys current hedge position extends through 2015 and provides price protection for approximately 40%, 30% and 10% of expected natural gas production sales volumes in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The Companys exposure to a $0.10 change in average NYMEX natural gas price is approximately $0.05, $0.06 and $0.10 per diluted share for 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The Company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices. See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in Item 7A and Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Items Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic operations in December 2005, the Company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of NORESCO. The savings guarantees provided that once the energy efficiency construction was completed by NORESCO, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years. The undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees is approximately $274 million as of December 31, 2009, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 20 years. In addition, the Company agreed to maintain in place certain outstanding payment and performance bonds, letters of credit and other guarantee obligations supporting NORESCOs obligations under certain customer contracts, existing leases and other items with an undiscounted maximum exposure to the Company as of December 31, 2009 of approximately $42 million, of which approximately $34 million relates to work already completed under the associated contracts. In addition, approximately $35 million of these guarantee obligations will end or be terminated not later than December 31, 2010. In exchange for the Companys agreement to maintain these guarantee obligations, the purchaser of the NORESCO business and NORESCO agreed, among other things, that NORESCO would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and agreed to reimburse the Company for any loss under the guarantee obligations, provided that the purchasers reimbursement obligation will not exceed $6 million in the aggregate and will expire on November 18, 2014. In 2008, the original purchaser of NORESCO sold its interest in NORESCO and transferred its obligations to a third party. In connection with that event, the new owner delivered to the Company a $1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations. The NORESCO guarantees are exempt from FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees. The Company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential 43 Table of Contents payments are expected to be immaterial to the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity. As such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees. In November 1995, EQT, through a subsidiary, guaranteed a tax indemnification to the limited partners of Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP) for any tax losses resulting from a disallowance of the nonconventional fuels tax credits, if certain representations and warranties of the Company were not true. The Company guaranteed the tax indemnification until the tax statute of limitations closes. The Company does not have any recourse provisions with third parties or any collateral held by third parties associated with this guarantee that could be liquidated to recover amounts paid, if any, under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is estimated to be approximately $12 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee and has not modified it subsequent to issuance. Additionally, based on the status of the Companys IRS examinations, the Company has determined that any potential loss from this guarantee is remote. The Company has a non equity interest in a variable interest entity, Appalachian NPI, LLC (ANPI), in which EQT was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Thus, ANPI is not consolidated within the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In determining the primary beneficiary, the Company estimated the expected losses and expected residual returns of ANPI under various scenarios in order to identify the party that would absorb the majority of the losses or benefit from the majority of the returns. The primary assumptions utilized in the scenarios included commodity price and production volumes. In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. The amendments are effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period after November 15, 2009. The Company determined that these amendments will not have a material impact on the Companys future consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, ANPI had $154 million of total assets and $144 million of total liabilities (including $85 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. ANPI is financed primarily through cash provided by operating activities. The Company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to ANPI, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the projects future cash flows from the preceding year end until the termination date of the agreement. This liquidity reserve guarantee is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT). The Company receives a market based fee for the issuance and continuation of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately $30 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee. The terms of the ANPI liquidity reserve guarantee require the Company to provide a letter of credit in favor of ANPI as security for the Companys obligations. The amount of this letter of credit requirement at December 31, 2009 was approximately $24.4 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee. The Company has entered into an agreement with ANGT to provide gathering and operating services to deliver ANGTs gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $15.7 million, $15.9 million and $15.8 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys guarantees. Pension Plans Total pension expense recognized by the Company in 2009, 2008 and 2007, excluding special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses, was $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company recognized special termination benefits, settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $0.9 million, $9.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company settled its pension obligations under a plan covering employees of the former Kentucky West Virginia Gas Company LLC, an EQT subsidiary which merged into EQT Gathering LLC in 2008. The former Kentucky West Virginia employees transferred to EQT Gathering LLC or EQT 44 Table of Contents Production Company. As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized pension settlement expense of approximately $8 million. An additional $1.4 million of pension settlement losses were recognized in 2008 for lump sum payments made during the normal course of plan operations. During 2007, the Company recognized a settlement expense of $0.5 million due to a plan design change for a specific union and an additional settlement expense of $0.5 million due to the transfer of some current active employees to non union employment. The Company made cash contributions to its pension plan of approximately $11.6 million, $3.4 million and $1.3 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of the previously described settlements as well as additional contributions to meet certain funding targets. Under current law, the Company expects to make cash payments related to its pensions of $1.2 million in 2010 to meet the 80% funding obligations on its remaining plans. Pension plan cash contributions are designed to at least meet requirements of the 80% funding level. The dollar amount of a cash contribution made in any particular year will vary as a result of gains or losses sustained by the Plan during the year due to market conditions. Pension contributions will be funded by cash flow from operations or by borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations, transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed. As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory accounting allows the Company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. Schedule of Contractual Obligations The following table details the undiscounted future projected payments associated with the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015+ (Thousands) Purchase obligations $ 2,006,592 $ 49,868 $ 224,853 $ 278,469 $ 1,453,402 Long term debt 1,949,200 206,000 15,000 1,728,200 Interest payments 1,168,179 133,315 264,804 243,636 526,424 Operating leases 171,578 40,244 32,515 16,233 82,586 Pension and other post retirement benefits 182,365 11,289 22,072 20,614 128,390 Other liabilities 38,706 35,752 2,954 Total contractual obligations $ 5,516,620 $ 270,468 $ 753,198 $ 573,952 $ 3,919,002 Purchase obligations primarily are commitments for demand charges under existing long term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines. Approximately $19.5 million of these obligations each year are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the Companys drilling program. In 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with Liberty Avenue Holdings, LLC to provide office space for the Companys new corporate headquarters. The obligations for the Companys various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $125.5 million as of December 31, 2009. The Company has subleased some of these facilities. Sublease payments to the Company total $21.3 million and are not netted from the amounts presented in the table above. The Company has agreements with Highlands Drilling, LLC, Patterson UTI Drilling Company, LLC and other drilling contractors to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company. These obligations totaled approximately $35.3 million as of December 31, 2009. In 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with AOP 45 Table of Contents Clearwater, LLC to secure capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water. This obligation totaled $10.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program and the 2008 Executive Performance Incentive Program. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the 2010 Executive Performance Incentive Program and the 2010 Stock Incentive Award program. The Company may adopt other plans in the future. The contractual obligations do not include any payments under the 2010 Executive Performance Incentive Program, the 2010 Stock Incentive Award program or any potential future plans. As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 of $56.6 million. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Several West Virginia lessors claimed in a suit filed on July 31, 2006 that EQT Production Company had underpaid royalties on gas produced and marketed from leases. The suit sought compensatory and punitive damages, an accounting and other relief. The plaintiffs later amended their complaint to name EQT as an additional defendant. The Company has settled the litigation. The settlement covers all of the Companys lessors in West Virginia who have not opted out of the settlement class. The Court has entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement. A Formal Fairness Hearing was held on January 20, 2010. The Company is waiting for entry of an order giving final approval of the settlement. The Company believes the reserve established for this litigation is sufficient. In the ordinary course of business, various other legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for these pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any other matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingent liabilities and commitments. Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon EQTs Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed and approved by the Companys Audit Committee, relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash 46 Table of Contents Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit. The depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves. The carrying values of the Companys proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. In order to determine whether impairment has occurred, the Company estimates the expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties. The estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves, utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset, market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable. Those properties would be written down to fair value, which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis. Indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. If it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made. Unproved properties had a net book value of $105.9 and $81.9 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no significant unproved properties balances at December 31, 2007. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves, a process which can be significantly impacted by managements expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans. Should the Company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities, future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Oil and Gas Reserves: The Company adopted SEC rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting as of December 31, 2009. Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10, are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Companys engineers and reviewed by the Companys independent engineers. Revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements. The Company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12 month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future 47 Table of Contents production and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Income Taxes: The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from pension and other post retirement benefits recorded in other comprehensive income, federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. No other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. The Company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. If this step is satisfied, then the Company must measure the tax position. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit realizable upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. In making this determination, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. Evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Derivative Commodity Instruments: The Company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production. Derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. See Commodity Risk Management above, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding hedging activities. The Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use as inputs market based 48 Table of Contents parameters, including but not limited to forward curves, discount rates, broker quotes, volatilities and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Companys credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterpartys credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Companys or counterpartys credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available. The values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. A substantial majority of the Companys derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be de designated, the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings, which could materially impact the results of operations. One of the requirements for hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged. Effectiveness may be impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective. The Company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads, credit ratings, credit default swap rates and market activity. In addition, the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the Company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the Company to margin requirements. Given the Companys price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are critical accounting estimates because the Companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of non performance risk and by changes in margin requirements. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008 the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of $31.4 million and $16.3 million, respectively. Contingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results. The Company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Companys plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company increases the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value, through charges to depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets. The Company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems, and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. 49 Table of Contents Share Based Compensation: The Company has awarded share based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 Long Term Incentive Plans. The Company treats certain of its Executive Performance Incentive Programs, including the 2008 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2008 EPIP) and the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program (2007 Supply Program) as liability awards. The actual cost to be recorded for these plans will not be known until the measurement date, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date. The Company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts. Approximately 70,000 units were granted under the 2008 EPIP. The payout of this program will be between zero and three times this number of units valued at the price of the Companys common stock at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2011. The payout multiple is dependent upon the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer groups total shareholder return and the downward discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors if the Company does not attain a specified revenue target. As of December 31, 2009 approximately 270,000 awards were outstanding under the 2007 Supply Program. The awards earned may be increased to a maximum of three times the initial award or reduced to zero based upon achievement of the predetermined production sales revenue and efficiency targets. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company increased its assumption for the payout multiple to approximately 290% of the units awarded. The performance period for the 2007 Supply Program ends on December 31, 2010. Assuming no change in the current payout multiple assumptions for both programs, a 10% increase in the Companys stock price assumptions for the 2008 EPIP and the 2007 Supply Program would have resulted in an increase in 2009 compensation expense under these plans of approximately $2 million. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted the 2009 Shareholder Value Plan (2009 SVP) in December 2008. A total of 977,600 units were granted under the plan. The payout of this award depended on a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group and the Companys average absolute return on total capital during the performance period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009. Payout of awards could be between zero and 250% of the number of units awarded at the price of the Companys common stock at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2009. The vesting of the stock units granted under this award occurred on December 31, 2009 and resulted in approximately 2.2 million units (225% of the award) with a value of approximately $45 million being distributed in cash on December 31, 2009. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the 2010 Executive Performance Incentive Program and the 2010 Stock Incentive Award program. The Company may adopt other plans in the future. The Company has not recorded an obligation under the 2010 Executive Performance Incentive Program, the 2010 Stock Incentive Award program or any potential future plans at December 31, 2009. The 1999 and 2009 Long Term Incentive Plans permit the grant of restricted stock awards and non qualified stock options to employees of the Company. For time restricted stock awards, compensation expense, which is based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The majority of the time based restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the three year period commencing with the date of grant. For non qualified stock options, compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Companys stock. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share based compensation are critical accounting estimates because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the Companys shares, the volatility of the Companys shares, market interest rates and the various performance factors. The impact on net income of these changes can be material. 50 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Commodity Instruments The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily through the EQT Production and EQT Midstream segments. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption Commodity Risk Management in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K. The Company uses non leveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is continually monitored. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices. The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. Commodity Price Risk The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10% increase or a 10% decrease in commodity prices. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Companys forecasted production, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk, the Company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company include futures contracts, swap agreements, collar agreements and option contracts, which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity. The Company also considers options and other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to ensure an adequate level of return for the well development and infrastructure investment at EQT Production and EQT Midstream. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2009, the Company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2015 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 142.9 Bcf of natural gas. See the Commodity Risk Management in the Capital Resources and Liquidity sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K for further discussion. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2009 levels would increase the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $66.9 million. A hypothetical increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2009 levels would decrease the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $64.2 million. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at December 31, 2009. The price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Companys balance sheet, resulting in the change in fair value. The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the Company and its subsidiaries physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the derivative 51 Table of Contents commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected. If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. Other Market Risks The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value. The Company believes that NYMEX traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants, including the Company, from any potential financial instability of the exchange members. The Companys swap, collar and option derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole. The Company utilizes various processes and analysis to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures. This includes closely monitoring current market conditions, counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits. To manage the level of credit risk, the Company deals with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better, enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security. Approximately 54%, or $144.5 million, of OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 have a positive fair value. All derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2009 are with counterparties having an S&P rating of A or above at that date. In September 2008, the credit support provider of one counterparty (Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc.) declared bankruptcy resulting in a default under various derivative contracts with the Company. As a result, those contracts were terminated and a reserve of approximately $5 million was recorded against the entire balance due to the Company. There is no additional income statement exposure to this counterparty beyond the reserve recorded in 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was not in default under any derivative contracts and has no knowledge of default by any other counterparty to derivative contracts. The Company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal non performance risk adjustment included in the Companys established fair value procedure. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas. A significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from EQT Production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas to certain marketers, including the Companys wholly owned marketing subsidiary EQT Energy, and utility and industrial customers located mainly in the Appalachian area. Additionally, a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from EQT Midstream is generated from the sale of produced natural gas liquids to a gas processor in Kentucky and gathering of natural gas in Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures on October 26, 2011. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. Lehman is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding $95 million under the facility. Lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the Company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to $1,405 52 Table of Contents million. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding under the facility $5.0 million of loans in support of corporate activities and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of $24.4 million. No one lender in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. The Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to otherwise limit the Companys exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry. 53 Table of Contents
