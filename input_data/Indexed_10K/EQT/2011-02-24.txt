Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations In 2010 EQT achieved record results. Highlights for 2010 include: Record annual sales of produced natural gas of 134.6 Bcfe, more than 34% higher than 2009; A 28% increase in proved reserves to 5.2 Tcfe; The Company drilled 489 gross wells during 2010, of which 326 were horizontal wells, 90 targeting the Marcellus Shale play and 236 targeting the Huron play; The Company was successful on more than 99.6% of the wells drilled in 2010; Achieved 20% decrease in unit lease operating expense (LOE), excluding production taxes, to $0.24 per Mcfe. Including production taxes, LOE was $0.48 per Mcfe; Record EQT Midstream throughput and operating income; and Record Distribution operating income of $83.2 million, 5% higher than 2009. EQTs consolidated net income for 2010 was $227.7 million, $1.57 per diluted share, compared with $156.9 million, $1.19 per diluted share, for 2009 and $255.6 million, $2.00 per diluted share, for 2008. The $70.8 million increase in net income from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to increased produced natural gas sales volumes, higher gathering revenues, increased net revenues for NGLs, lower long term incentive compensation expense and lower exploration expense. These favorable variances were partially offset by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, lower average well head sales prices, lower storage and marketing revenues and higher interest expense. EQT revenues for 2010 increased approximately 4% compared to 2009 revenues. Gas sales volumes increased more than 34% from 2009 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys producing wells. Gathered volumes increased due to the Companys production growth and infrastructure expansion, and NGL sales revenues increased as a result of an increase in NGL sales price as well as an increase in NGLs sold. Residential revenues increased as a result of the Companys base rate increases in February 2009 and August 2010. These increases were partially offset by a 4% decline in the average well head sales price as a result of lower hedge prices year over year which more than offset slightly increased commodity market prices and a 7% decline in stor age and marketing revenues primarily resulting from lower margins on pipeline capacity. 28 Table of Contents Operating expenses for 2010 decreased approximately 7% compared to 2009. This decline was primarily attributable to a $118.2 million decrease in purchased gas costs due to lower recoverable commodity costs, a $39.3 million decrease in long term incentive compensation expense primarily due to the Companys share price and performance in relation to its peer group which resulted in $61.8 million of expense in 2009 and a $12.5 million decrease in the Companys exploration program. The decrease in exploration expense is primarily a result of a reduction in the level of purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties. These decreases were partially offset by higher depletion resulting from increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The $98.7 million decrease in net income from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a lower average well head sales price, increased incentive compensation expense, increased depletion expense and higher interest expense partially offset by increased gas and NGL sales volumes at EQT Production, increased gathering revenues, Big Sandy Pipeline activity at EQT Midstream and an increase in base rates in the Distribution segment. Incentive compensation expense increased from 2008 to 2009 and decreased from 2009 to 2010 as a result of expenses related to the Companys 2009 Shareholder Value Plan recorded in 2009 and a reversal of previously recorded expense on the Companys 2005 Executive Performance Incentive Program in 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in the Companys stock price in 2008. Incentive compensation is primarily reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Statements of Consolidated Income. A significant portion of the 2009 expense and 2008 reversal are reported as unallocated expenses in the information by business segment in Note 2 of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense increased from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the Companys continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure. This investment was partially funded by the issuance of $700 million of 8.125% notes in May 2009. See Investing Activities in Capital Resources and Liquidity for a discussion of capital expenditures. Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income. Interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Certain performance related incentive compensation expenses (income) and administrative expenses totaling $15.1 million, $62.2 million and ($17.4) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were not allocated to business segments. The unallocated expenses in 2010 and 2009 primarily relate to performance related incentive compensation expenses, while the unallocated income in 2008 primarily relates to the reversal of previously recorded performance related incentive compensation expenses. The Company has reconciled each segments operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the Companys consolidated operating income, equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income totals in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, these subtotals are reconciled to the Companys consolidated net income in Note 2. The Company has also reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQTs management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQTs segments without being obscured by thes e items for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. On February 1, 2011, the Company sold its natural gas processing complex in Langley, Kentucky. Subsequent to the closing of this sale, the processing of the Companys produced natural gas has been performed by a third party vendor. The revenue received as a result of the fractionation of NGLs which were extracted from 29 Table of Contents the Companys produced natural gas (frac spread) was previously reported in the EQT Midstream segment in conjunction with the results of the processing activities. As a result of the sale of the Companys processing assets, management determined that this frac spread would be reported in the EQT Production segment as additional revenue for its produced NGL sales. The segment disclosures and discussions contained in this report have been reclassified to reflect all periods presented under the new methodology. In conjunction with the closing of the sale, the Company executed a long term agreement to receive processing services for its Kentucky Huron Shale gas and extended its existing agreement for NGL transportation, fractionation and marketing services until 2022. Expenses incurred during 2010 to operate the Langley processing complex, excluding DD&A, were $20.2 milli on. If the natural gas volumes processed by the Langley facility in 2010 would have been processed by a third party, the Company would have incurred approximately $35.1 million in processing fees and expenses.

(c) Average well head sales price is calculated as market price adjusted for hedging activities less deductions for gathering, processing and transmission included in EQT Midstream revenues. These deductions totaled $1.69/Mcfe, $1.69/Mcfe and $1.50/Mcfe for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, third party gathering, processing and transportation deductions totaled $0.42/Mcfe, $0.36/Mcfe and $0.43/Mcfe for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (d) Capital expenditures in 2010, 2009 and 2008 include $357.7 million, $31.0 million and $85.5 million, respectively, for undeveloped property acquisitions. The amount for 2010 includes $230.7 million of undeveloped property which was acquired with EQT stock. (e) Production taxes include severance and production related ad valorem and other property taxes. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. December 31, 2009 EQT Productions operating income totaled $223.5 million for 2010 compared to $185.9 million for 2009, an increase of $37.6 million between years, primarily due to increased sales volumes of produced natural gas, NGL and crude oil, partially offset by a lower average well head sales price and an increase in depletion and SG&A expenses. Total operating revenues were $537.7 million for 2010 compared to $421.0 million for 2009. The $116.7 million increase in operating revenues was due to increased sales volumes which more than offset lower realized prices. The increase in produced natural gas sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus and Huron Shale plays. This increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells. The $0.18 per Mcfe decrease in the average well head sales price was primarily due to lower hedging gains and lower hedged gas sales compared to 2009, partially offset by a 10% increase in the average NYMEX price and a higher sales price for NGLs. Operating expenses totaled $314.2 million for 2010 compared to $235.1 million for 2009. The 34% increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increases of $66.3 million in DD&A, $20.9 million in SG&A, $2.6 31 Table of Contents million in LOE partially offset by a decrease of $12.5 million in exploration expense. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate ($25.6 million) and volume ($38.2 million). The $0.20 per Mcfe increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to the reversal of reserves in the prior year for certain legal disputes; higher personnel costs including incentive compensation and hiring and relocation costs, a portion of which were recorded at headquarters in prior years; a charge for the buy out of excess contractual capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water; and an increase in professional fees. Despite the 20% decrease in the average LOE per Mcfe, total LOE increased as a result of incre ased activity in the Marcellus Shale play in the current year. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in exploration expense due to a reduction in geophysical activity compared to the prior year as well as an impairment charge in 2009 on an exploratory Utica well. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. December 31, 2008 EQT Productions operating income totaled $185.9 million for 2009 compared to $267.6 million for 2008, a decrease of 31% between years, primarily due to a lower average well head sales price and an increase in depletion expense partially offset by increased sales volumes. Total operating revenues were $421.0 million for 2009 compared to $473.0 million for 2008. The decrease in operating revenues was due to lower realized prices which more than offset increased sales volumes. The average well head sales price decreased by $1.40 per Mcfe, primarily as a result of a 56% decrease in NYMEX natural gas prices, a 36% lower sales price for NGLs and a lower percentage of hedged gas sales, partially offset by a higher realized hedge price. The decrease in prices was partially offset by increased sales volumes of more than 19% as a result of the 2008 and 2009 drilling programs, net of the normal production decline in the Companys wells, and a decrease in Company usage and line loss. Operating expenses totaled $235.1 million for 2009 compared to $205.3 million for 2008. The $29.8 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of $39.2 million in DD&A partially offset by decreases of $16.4 million in production taxes, $1.4 million in SG&A, and $0.5 million in LOE. In addition, 2009 includes an $8.8 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the Companys examination of emerging plays and the impairment charge on an exploratory Utica well. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate ($26.3 million) and volume ($11.0 million). The $0.25 per Mcfe increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing propert ies. The decrease in production taxes was primarily due to a $17.8 million decrease in severance taxes partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in property taxes. The decrease in severance taxes (a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted) was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices partially offset by higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes. The increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years, as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the Companys wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for certain legal disputes partially offset by higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the Company, increased franchise and gross receipts taxes attributable to increased receipts and costs associated with the amendment of a contract to secure capaci ty for the processing and disposal of salt water. The decrease in LOE was primarily attributable to the 2008 program to test the re fracturing of existing wells. 32 Table of Contents EQT Midstream Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 % change 2010 2009 2008 % change 2008 2007 OPERATIONAL DATA Gathering and processing: Gathered volumes (BBtu) 195,642 161,480 21.2 145,031 11.3 Average gathering fee ($/MMBtu) $ 1.11 $ 1.04 6.7 $ 0.98 6.1 Gathering and compression expense ($/MMBtu) (a) $ 0.37 $ 0.42 (11.9) $ 0.37 13.5 Transmission pipeline throughput (BBtu) 109,165 84,132 29.8 76,270 10.3 Net operating revenues (thousands): Gathering $ 212,170 $ 165,519 28.2 $ 140,118 18.1 Transmission 84,190 76,749 9.7 51,563 48.8 Storage, marketing and other 100,097 107,530 (6.9) 95,842 12.2 Total net operating revenues $ 396,457 $ 349,798 13.3 $ 287,523 21.7 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 193,128 $ 201,082 (4.0) $ 593,564 (66.1) FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 580,698 $ 465,444 24.8 $ 597,073 (22.0) Purchased gas costs 184,241 115,646 59.3 309,550 (62.6) Total net operating revenues 396,457 349,798 13.3 287,523 21.7 Operating expenses: Operating and maintenance (O&M) 107,601 95,164 13.1 83,577 13.9 SG&A 48,127 47,146 2.1 49,208 (4.2) DD&A 61,863 53,291 16.1 34,802 53.1 Total operating expenses 217,591 195,601 11.2 167,587 16.7 Operating income $ 178,866 $ 154,197 16.0 $ 119,936 28.6 Other income, net $ 509 $ 1,357 (62.5) $ 5,678 (76.1) Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments $ 9,532 $ 6,376 49.5 $ 5,053 26.2 (a) The calculation of gathering and compression expense ($/MMBtu) for 2008 excludes a $9.5 million charge for pension and other post retirement benefits. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. December 31, 2009 EQT Midstreams operating income totaled $178.9 million for 2010 compared to $154.2 million for 2009. The $24.7 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased gathering volumes and 33 Table of Contents gathering rates, partially offset by decreased storage, marketing and other net operating revenues and increased operating expenses. Total net operating revenues were $396.5 million for 2010 compared to $349.8 million for 2009. The $46.7 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $46.7 million increase in gathering net operating revenues and a $7.4 million increase in transmission net operating revenues, partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues. Gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 21% increase in gathered volumes as well as a 7% increase in the average gathering fee. This increase was driven primarily by higher Marcellus Shale volumes from EQT Production. Transmission net revenues in 2010 increased from the prior year primarily as a result of higher firm transportation activity from affiliated shippers due to the increased Marcellus Shale volumes and increased capacity from Phase 1 of the Equitrans Marcellus expansion project, which came on line during the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in storage, marketing and other net revenues was primarily due to decreased margins and volumes of third party marketing that utilized pipeline capacity, less volatility in seasonal price spreads and decreased basis differentials which in 2009 had a positive impact on the Company. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in NGL processing net revenues primarily due to an increase in average NGL sales price. Total operating revenues increased by $115.3 million, or 25%, primarily as a result of increased marketed volumes due to higher Marcellus Shale activity and higher gathered volumes. Total purchased gas costs also increased as a result of higher Marcellus Shale activity. Operating expenses totaled $217.6 million for 2010 compared to $195.6 million for 2009. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $12.4 million in O&M and $8.6 million in DD&A. The increase in O&M is primarily due to higher electricity, labor, and non income taxes associated with the growth of the business as well as a $2.6 million loss on compressor decommissioning at the Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing facility. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to the increased investment in gathering and transmission infrastructure. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled $9.5 million for 2010 compared to $6.4 million for 2009. This increase is related to equity earnings recorded for EQT Midstreams investment in Nora Gathering, LLC. The higher net income was driven by increases in the average gathering fee and gathered volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses for the Nora operations in 2010. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. December 31, 2008 EQT Midstreams operating income totaled $154.2 million for 2009 compared to $119.9 million for 2008. The $34.3 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased gathering volumes and rates and increased Big Sandy Pipeline activity, partially offset by increased operating expenses. Total net operating revenues were $349.8 million for 2009 compared to $287.5 million for 2008. The $62.3 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $25.4 million increase in gathering net operating revenues, a $25.2 million increase in transmission net operating revenues, and an $11.7 million increase in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues. Gathering net operating revenues increased due to an 11% increase in gathered volumes as well as a 6% increase in the average gathering fee. This increase was driven by more volumes gathered for EQT Production, as well as increased third party customer volume due to increased available capacity with the Big Sandy Pipeline being operational for a full year in 2009. Transmission net revenues in 2009 increased from the prior year primarily due to increased capacity from the Big Sandy Pipeline, which came on line in the second quarter of 2008. 34 Table of Contents The increase in storage, marketing and other net revenues was primarily due to increased third party marketing that utilized Big Sandy Pipeline capacity as well as increased margins on third party NGLs sold. Total operating revenues decreased by $131.6 million, or 22%, primarily as a result of lower sales prices on decreased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets partially offset by an increase in gathering volumes and rates and increased transmission revenues from the Big Sandy Pipeline. Total purchased gas costs decreased 63% as a result of lower gas costs on decreased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets. Operating expenses totaled $195.6 million for 2009 compared to $167.6 million for 2008. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $11.6 million in O&M and $18.5 million in DD&A, offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in SG&A. The increase in O&M resulted mainly from higher electricity, labor, non income taxes and compressor maintenance expenses for the gathering business due to new compressors and processing facilities put in operation in the second half of 2008, partially offset by a decrease of $9.5 million relating to pension and other post retirement benefit charges recorded in 2008. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to the increased investment in infrastructure during 2008 and 2009. Other income represents allowance for equity funds used during construction. The $4.3 million decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily caused by AFUDC recorded on the construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline in 2008. AFUDC was no longer recorded once Big Sandy was placed into service in the second quarter of 2008. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled $6.4 million for 2009 compared to $5.1 million for 2008. This increase is related to equity earnings recorded for EQT Midstreams investment in Nora Gathering, LLC. Earnings increased in 2009 as a result of higher net income for Nora Gathering, LLC in 2009 compared to 2008. The higher net income was driven by increases in the average gathering fee and gathered volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses for the Nora operations in 2009. 35 Table of Contents Distribution Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 % change 2010 2009 2008 % change 2009 2008 OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,829) 5,516 5,474 0.8 5,622 (2.6) Residential sales and transportation volume (MMcf) 23,132 23,098 0.1 23,824 (3.0) Commercial and industrial volume (MMcf) 27,124 30,521 (11.1) 27,503 11.0 Total throughput (MMcf) 50,256 53,619 (6.3) 51,327 4.5 Net operating revenues (thousands): Residential $ 117,418 $ 111,007 5.8 $ 105,059 5.7 Commercial & industrial 48,614 47,432 2.5 46,394 2.2 Off system and energy services 21,365 21,545 (0.8) 19,415 11.0 Total net operating revenues 187,397 179,984 4.1 170,868 5.3 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 36,619 $ 33,707 8.6 $ 45,770 (26.4) FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 474,143 $ 560,283 (15.4) $ 698,385 (19.8) Purchased gas costs 286,746 380,299 (24.6) 527,517 (27.9) Net operating revenues 187,397 179,984 4.1 170,868 5.3 Operating expenses: O & M 44,047 43,663 0.9 44,161 (1.1) SG&A 35,994 35,028 2.8 44,793 (21.8) DD&A 24,174 22,375 8.0 22,055 1.5 Total operating expenses 104,215 101,066 3.1 111,009 (9.0) Operating income $ 83,182 $ 78,918 5.4 $ 59,859 31.8 Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. December 31, 2009 Distributions operating income totaled $83.2 million for 2010 compared to $78.9 million for 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in base rates which was partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net operating revenues were $187.4 million for 2010 compared to $180.0 million for 2009. The $7.4 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily the result of an increase in residential net operating revenues. Net operating revenues from residential customers increased $6.4 million as a result of the approval of the Companys Pennsylvania base rate increase in late February 2009 as well as the approval of the Companys West Virginia base rate increase in August 2010. Commercial and industrial net revenues increased $1.2 million due to higher base rates and an increase in performance based revenues, partially offset by a decrease in usage by one industrial customer. High volume sales to this industrial customer had low unit margins and the decrease in sales did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. Off system a nd energy services net operating revenues decreased due to lower 36 Table of Contents margins in asset optimization activities, partially offset by increased gathering revenue as a result of higher rates. A decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates and a decrease in gas costs associated with asset optimization transactions resulted in a decrease in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs. Operating expenses totaled $104.2 million for 2010 compared to $101.1 million for 2009. The $3.1 million increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher bad debt and depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in bad debt expense from 2009 to 2010 was primarily the result of a favorable one time adjustment in the allowance for uncollectible accounts in 2009 due to the recovery of CAP costs associated with the approval of the Pennsylvania rate case settlement. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accruals for certain non income tax reserves in 2009 and a decrease in incentive compensation costs in 2010. The increase in DD&A expense was primarily the result of increased capital expenditures. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. December 31, 2008 Distributions operating income totaled $78.9 million for 2009 compared to $59.9 million for 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in base rates and lower operating expenses. Net operating revenues were $180.0 million for 2009 compared to $170.9 million for 2008. The $9.1 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily the result of the approval of the Companys base rate increase in 2009. Net revenues from residential customers increased $5.9 million as a result of an increase in base rates which was partially offset by the absence of a 2008 non recurring increase in CAP activities, as well as customer conservation and slightly warmer weather. Off system and energy services net operating revenues increased $2.1 million due to higher revenues from gathering activities resulting primarily from increased rates. Commercial and industrial net revenues increased $1.0 million due to higher base rates and an increase in usage by one industrial customer, partially offset by lower performance based revenues. Th e high volume sales from the industrial customer have low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues. A decrease in gas costs associated with asset optimization transactions and a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates resulted in a decrease in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs. Operating expenses totaled $101.1 million for 2009 compared to $111.0 million for 2008. The $9.9 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of lower bad debt, general overhead and labor and fringe benefit expenses in 2009 and the absence of the holding company reorganization costs that were incurred in 2008. The reduction in bad debt expense from 2008 to 2009 was the result of favorable adjustments in the allowance for uncollectible accounts in 2009 due to increased customer participation in programs assisting low income customers in paying their bills, the recovery of CAP costs associated with the approval of the rate case settlement and a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in accruals for certain non income tax reserves and an increase in incentive com pensation costs. Other Income Statement Items Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Thousands) Other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities $ $ $ (7,835) Gain on sale of available for sale securities, net 2,079 Other income 1,147 2,076 6,233 As discussed in Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Companys available for sale investments consist of equity and bond funds intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the Company self insures. At December 31, 2008, these investments had a fair market value which was $7.8 million below cost. The Company analyzed the decline in these investments based on the extent and duration of the impairment and the nature of the underlying assets. Although the Company holds these investments to fund long term liabilities, based on the extent and duration of the impairment, combined with then current market conditions, the Company concluded that the decline was other than temporary. As such, the Company recognized a $7.8 million impairment in earnings in 2008. 37 Table of Contents During 2010, the Company sold available for sale securities for $12.3 million which resulted in gross realized gains of $2.1 million, $1.4 million of which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). In 2010, 2009 and 2008, other income primarily relates to contributions in aid of construction and the equity portion of AFUDC on various projects. The decrease in other income from 2008 to 2009 reflects the completion of the construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline in the second quarter of 2008. Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Thousands) Interest expense $128,157 $111,779 $58,394 Interest expense increased by $16.4 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the full year of expense incurred on the $700 million of 8.125% notes issued in May 2009. This increase was partially offset by a $4.4 million increase in capitalized interest primarily due to the capitalization of interest on Marcellus Shale well development beginning in 2010 reflecting the longer time to flow gas and increased investment associated with the multi well pads. Interest expense increased by $53.4 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the Companys continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2009. This investment was partially funded by the issuance of $700 million of 8.125% notes in May 2009. The interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 2.8% decrease in the average short term interest rate during 2009. Weighted average annual interest rates on the Companys long term debt were 6.8%, 6.5% and 6.1% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Weighted average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 0.7%, 0.7% and 3.5% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income Taxes Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Thousands) Income Taxes $127,520 $96,668 $154,920 Income tax expense increased by $30.9 million from 2009 to 2010 as a result of higher pre tax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. During 2010, the Companys effective income tax rate decreased from 38.1% to 35.9%. The higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily the result of the impact in 2009 of certain nondeductible expenses and the loss of certain prior year deductions as a result of carrying 2009 losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid. These higher rates in 2009 were partially mitigated by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes in 2009. Rates were also lower in 2010 due to the reduction of the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation in 2010. Income tax expense decreased by $58.3 million from 2008 to 2009 despite a higher effective tax rate as a result of lower pre tax income. During 2009, the Companys effective income tax rate increased from 37.7% to 38.1%. The higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily the result of nondeductible compensation expense partially offset by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes. The Company recorded a tax benefit in 2008 for a change in the West Virginia state tax law that primarily provides for a reduction in future corporate income tax rates which was partially offset by additional tax expense recorded as a result of the completion of the IRS audit through the 2005 tax year. 38 Table of Contents The Company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss position for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and expects to pay minimal federal income taxes for the next few years as the Companys drilling program in Appalachia continues to generate intangible drilling cost deductions, unless tax laws change or the Company incurs an unexpected taxable gain from a transaction. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently deducts approximately 80% of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (IDC) in the year incurred. The primary reasons for the Companys net operating loss are the IDC deduction resulting from the Companys drilling program and the accelerated tax deprecation for expansion of gathering infrastructure which provide tax deductions in excess of book deductions. In addition, tax legislation was passed in 2008, 2009 and 2010 that allowed c ompanies to deduct 50% of the cost of qualified assets placed in service for those years. Under the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Create Act of 2010 (2010 Tax Relief Act), companies may deduct 100% of the cost of qualified assets placed in service after September 8, 2010 and before January 1, 2012. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes. Outlook The Company is committed to profitably expanding its production and developing its reserves through cost effective, technologically advanced horizontal drilling in its existing plays. A substantial portion of the Companys drilling efforts in 2011 are expected to be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. The Company expects natural gas sales volume growth of 30% in 2011. Gathering, transmission and marketed volumes are also expected to increase as the Company expands its infrastructure to support its expected growth of produced gas sales. Specifically, in 2011 the Company will focus on: Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale is the Companys fastest growing and most profitable play. The Company expects to access significantly more reserves for less than a proportional amount of development costs through extended lateral drilling and experimenting with new hydraulic fracturing techniques. The Company also plans to spend $12.0 million on seismic data to determine optimal placement for future Marcellus Shale wells. To support the Marcellus Shale drilling growth, the Company plans to add 130 MMcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity. The Company will also strive to optimize its contractual capacity and storage assets, which include 350,000 Dth per day of capacity in TGPs 300 Line expansion project, which is expected to turn in line late in 2011. Also, the Company expects to continue to invest in its Equitrans Marcellus expansion project. The project is underway and, given its significant scope, is progressing in stages. Equitrans placed Phase 1 into service on October 1, 2010. Equitrans filed the certificate application for Phase 2 with the FERC on January 27, 2011, anticipates obtaining final approval in the summer of 2011 and expects to have Phase 2 in service by the end of 2012. Over the course of the next two years, the Equitrans Marcellus expansion project will add approximately 550 MMcfe per day of incremental transmission capacity. Equitrans entered into firm capacity agreements of approximately 530 MMcfe per day with both third parties and affiliates in support of the Marcellus expansion project. Finally, to continue the accelerated development of the Marcellus Shale play, the Company is also considering partnering with third parties, as well as other arrangements, including a potential sale of the Big Sandy Pipeline, to monetize the value of mature assets to redeploy into higher growth Marcellus Shale development. Huron Shale. The Company plans to continue developing its highly successful horizontal drilling program in the Huron Shale play, where it drills horizontal wells and, where possible, extends the lateral length. As many of the Huron wells produce wet gas (with significant NGL content), and NGLs receive higher prices per Btu than natural gas, the Company expects to continue benefiting from the improved economics over an equivalent dry gas well. The Company has significant midstream capacity in the Huron play and is concentrating its drilling near this capacity to further enhance the return on in vestment. 39 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview The Companys primary sources of cash for 2010 were cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from an offering of common stock. The Companys primary uses of cash for 2010 were for capital expenditures and interest and dividend payments. Operating Activities The Companys net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was $789.7 million compared to $725.7 million for the same period of 2009. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to higher earnings resulting from increased production volumes and higher NGL prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices. In addition, EQT received income tax refunds of $129.5 million in 2010 primarily relating to the 2009 net operating loss carryback. The Companys net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was $725.7 million compared to $509.2 million for the same period of 2008. EQT received an income tax refund of $115.2 million in 2009 relating to the 2008 net operating loss carryback. The remaining increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily the result of lower inventory, accounts receivable, unbilled revenues and margin deposits due to lower average natural gas commodity prices in 2009 compared to 2008. These were partially offset by a corresponding decrease in accounts payable at December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1,239.4 million for 2010 as compared to $985.5 million for 2009. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures to $1,246.9 million in 2010 from $963.9 million in 2009. See discussion of capital expenditures below. This increase was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and reduced capital contributions to Nora Gathering, LLC. Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $985.5 million for 2009 as compared to $1,376.0 million for 2008. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following: a decrease in capital expenditures to $963.9 million in 2009 from $1,344.0 million in 2008 due to the completion of the construction of the Big Sandy Pipeline and Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant upgrade in 2008; a decrease in capital contributions to Nora Gathering, LLC for use in midstream infrastructure projects to $6.4 million in 2009 from $29.0 million in 2008; 40 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures 2011 Plan 2010 Actual 2009 Actual 2008 Actual Well development (primarily drilling) $ 691 million $ 888 million $ 686 million $ 615 million Undeveloped property acquisitions $ $ 358 million $ 31 million $ 86 million Midstream infrastructure $ 244 million $ 193 million $ 201 million $ 594 million Distribution infrastructure and other corporate items $ 35 million $ 39 million $ 46 million $ 49 million Total $ 970 million $ 1,478 million $ 964 million $ 1,344 million Less: non cash $ $ 231 million $ $ Total cash capital expenditures $ 970 million $ 1,247 million $ 964 million $ 1,344 million Capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $888 million and $686 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company drilled 489 gross wells (395 net wells) in 2010, including 90 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells with approximately 300,000 feet of pay and 236 horizontal Huron wells with approximately 1.0 million feet of pay, compared to 702 gross wells (536 net wells) in 2009, including 46 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells with approximately 100,000 feet of pay and 356 horizontal Huron wells with approximately 1.0 million feet of pay. Capital expenditures for 2010 also included $358 million for undeveloped property acquisitions, primarily within the Marcellus Shale play. Capital expenditures for 2009 included $31 million for undeveloped property acquisitions. During 2010, the Company acquired approximately 58,000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale from a group of private operators and landowners. The acreage is located primarily in Cameron, Clearfield, Elk and Jefferson counties in Pennsylvania. The purchase included a 200 mile gathering system, with associated rights of way, and approximately 100 producing vertical wells. The Company paid $282.2 million for these assets, $230.7 million in EQT stock and $51.5 million in cash. Following the closing of the acquisition, the Company holds approximately 520,000 net acres in the high pressure Marcellus Shale fairway. Capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled $193 million for 2010. During the year, EQT Midstream turned in line 132 miles of pipeline and 21,000 horse power of compression primarily within the Marcellus and Huron Shale plays. During 2009, midstream capital expenditures were $201 million. EQT Midstream turned in line 274 miles of pipeline and 21,850 horse power of compression primarily within the Huron play in that year. Capital expenditures at Distribution totaled $37 million and $34 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, principally for pipeline replacement and metering. The increase in capital expenditures was due to increased gathering related infrastructure spending in 2010 as compared to 2009. The Company is committed to profitably expanding its production and reserves through horizontal drilling, exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays and expanding its infrastructure in the Appalachian Basin through, among other projects, the Equitrans Marcellus expansion project. Capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be concentrated on drilling in areas that already benefit from the Companys substantial Appalachian midstream infrastructure. The Companys planned 2011 capital expenditures are designed to achieve annual gas sales volume growth of 30% in 2011, without requiring access to the capital markets. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to finance its planned capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities as well as the proceeds from the sale of the Kentucky na tural gas processing facility. 41 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $449.7 million for 2010 as compared to $259.8 million for 2009 as a result of the proceeds from the 2010 equity offering exceeding the proceeds of the 2009 debt offering, net of repayment of short term loans. On March 16, 2010, the Company completed a common stock offering of 12,500,000 shares. The underwriters in this transaction also exercised their over allotment option to purchase 225,000 additional shares of the Companys Common Stock on April 14, 2010. The Company is using the net proceeds of $537.2 million from the offering to accelerate development of its Marcellus and Huron Shale plays. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $259.8 million for 2009 as compared to $785.1 million for 2008. During 2009, the Company received $700 million from the public sale of 8.125% Senior Notes due June 1, 2019. By comparison, during 2008, the Company received $560.7 million from the public sale of 8.625 million shares of common stock and $500 million from the public sale of 6.50% Senior Notes due April 1, 2018. A portion of the 2009 and 2008 debt offerings were used to repay short term borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility during the periods. The Company repaid $314.9 million in short term borrowing during 2009 and $130.1 million in short term borrowings during the same period in 2008. The Company also repaid $4.3 million in long term debt during 2009. Short term Borrowings EQT primarily utilizes short term borrowings to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until they can be permanently financed, to ensure sufficient levels of inventory and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments. The amount of short term borrowings used for inventory transactions is driven by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution and marketing operations. Margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments executed. The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures on December 8, 2014. The facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and any other lawful corporate purposes, including support of any commercial paper program maintained by the Company from time to time. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 20 financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. The Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the Companys exposure if problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding under the revolving credit facility loans of $53.7 million, and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of $23.5 million. The weighted average interest rate for short term loans outstanding as of December 31, 2010 was 1.8% and the maximum amount of outstanding short term loans at any time during 2010 was $139.7 million. The average daily balance of short term loans outstanding over the course of the year was approximately $24.9 million and the weighted average interest rate on the Companys short term borrowings was 0.7% for 2010. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, the Company may obtain loans, which are base rate loans or fixed period Eurodollar rate loans. Base rate loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus a margin determined on the basis of the Company&# 146;s then current credit rating. Fixed period Eurodollar rate loans bear interest on a Eurodollar rate plus a margin determined on the basis of the Companys then current credit rating. The Companys short term borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less. Security Ratings and Financing Triggers The table below reflects the credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the Company at December 31, 2010. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Companys cost of short term and long term debt (including interest rates and fees under its lines of credit), collateral requirements under derivative instruments and its access to the credit markets. 42 Table of Contents Unsecured Medium Term Commercial Rating Service Notes Paper Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB A 3 Fitch Ratings Service BBB+ F2 On September 30, 2010 Moodys Investors Services (Moodys) reaffirmed its ratings on EQT. The outlook is negative. Moodys stated that the ratings reflect the diversification and vertical integration among its three business segments as well as the Baa stand alone quality of both its E&P and LDC operations. On September 20, 2010, Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) reaffirmed its ratings on EQT. The outlook is negative. S&P stated that the ratings and outlook reflect the Companys competitive operating cost structure in its exploration and production (E&P) segment, long reserve life and the Companys aggressive spending in its more volatile E&P and midstream businesses. On March 26, 2010, Fitch affirmed its ratings on EQT stating that the ratings are supported by the strong performance of its upstream segment, the relatively predictable cash flows from its midstream and distribution segments, a significant use of equity to help finance its growth strategy, and managements continued maintenance of a strong liquidity position. The Companys credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the credit rating agencies downgrade the Companys ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Companys access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs and margin deposits on derivative contracts would increase, counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. The required margin is subject to significant change as a result of other factors bes ides credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. The Companys debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. The most significant default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Companys current credit facilitys financial covenants require a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. Commodity Risk Management The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Companys risk management program includes the use of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts and options and OTC natural gas swap agreements and options (collectively, derivative commodity instruments) to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily fixed price swaps, collars and options. The approximate volumes and prices of the Companys total hedge position for 2011 through 2013 production are: 43 Table of Contents 2011 2012 2013 Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 56 24 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 4.86 $ 5.27 $ Puts Total Volume (Bcf) 3 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 7.35 $ $ Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 21 21 15 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 6.53 $ 6.51 $ 6.12 Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 11.91 $ 11.83 $ 11.80 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf In 2008, the Company effectively settled certain derivative commodity swaps scheduled to mature during the period 2010 through 2013 by de designating the swaps and entering into directly counteractive swaps. In 2009, the Company also terminated certain collars scheduled to mature during the period 2010 through 2012. As of the dates of these transactions, the Company had recorded a loss, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $12 million ($21 million pre tax) for the swaps and a gain, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $5 million ($8 million pre tax) for the collars. The net loss recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) from these transactions will be recognized in operating revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income, and included in the average well head sales price, wh en the underlying physical transactions occur. As a result, the Company will recognize reduced operating revenues of approximately $5.4 million, $0.6 million and $2.5 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in Item 7A and Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Items Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic operations in December 2005, the Company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of NORESCO. The savings guarantees provided that once the energy efficiency construction was completed by NORESCO, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years. The undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees is approximately $234 million as of December 31, 2010, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 19 years. In addition, the Company agreed to maintain in place certain outstanding payment and performance bonds, letters of credit and other guarantee obligations supporting NORESCOs obligations under certain customer contracts, existing leases and other items with an undiscounted maximum exposure to the Company as of December 31, 2010 of approximately $40 million, of which approximately $34 million relates to bonds that were to have been terminated as of December 31, 2010 for work completed under the underlying contracts. The Company is working with NORESCO to resolve any open matters with respect to these bonds. In exchange for the Companys agreement to maintain these guarantee obligations, the purchaser of the NORESCO business and NORESCO agreed, among other things, that NORESCO would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and agreed to reimburse the Company for any loss under the guarantee obligations, provided that the purchasers reimbursement obligation will not exceed $6 million in the aggregate and will expire on November 18, 2014. In 2008, the original purchaser of NORESCO sold its interest in NORESCO and transferred its obligations to a third party. In connection with that event, the new owner delivered to the Company a $1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations. 44 Table of Contents The NORESCO guarantees are exempt from FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees. The Company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity. As such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees. The Company has a non equity interest in a variable interest entity, Appalachian NPI, LLC (ANPI), in which EQT was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary because EQT does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact ANPIs economic performance. Thus, ANPI is not consolidated within the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2010, ANPI had $143.8 million of total assets and $86.1 million of total liabilities (including $66.3 million of long term debt, including current maturities), excluding minority interest. ANPI is financed primarily through cash provided by operating activities. The Company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to ANPI, which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the projects future cash flows from the preceding year end until the termination date of the agreement. This liquidity reserve guarantee is equal to the fair market value of the assets purchased by ANPI. The Company receives a market based fee for the issuance and continuation of the reserve guarantee. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately $31 million. The Company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee. The terms of the ANPI liquidity reserve guarantee require the Company to provide a letter of credit in f avor of ANPI as security for the Companys obligations. The amount of this letter of credit requirement at December 31, 2010 was approximately $23.5 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee. The Company has entered into an agreement with Appalachian Natural Gas Trust (ANGT) to provide gathering and operating services to deliver ANGTs gas to market. In addition, the Company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered. The revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately $15.6 million, $15.7 million and $15.9 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys guarantees. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations, transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed. As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory accounting allows the Company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. 45 Table of Contents Schedule of Contractual Obligations The following table details the undiscounted future projected payments associated with the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016+ (Thousands) Purchase obligations $1,608,554 $ 66,553 $ 293,334 $ 223,637 $ 1,025,030 Long term debt 1,949,200 6,000 210,000 165,000 1,568,200 Interest payments 1,034,866 133,296 253,407 241,017 407,146 Operating leases 171,747 28,390 45,204 23,427 74,726 Pension and other post retirement benefits 174,263 10,722 20,315 19,183 124,043 Other liabilities 38,173 38,173 Total contractual obligations $4,976,803 $ 283,134 $ 822,260 $ 672,264 $ 3,199,145 Purchase obligations primarily are commitments for demand charges under existing long term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines. Approximately $17.0 million and $13.7 million of these obligations payable in 2011 and 2012, respectively, are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the Companys drilling program. The obligations for the Companys various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $119.0 million as of December 31, 2010. The Company has subleased some of these facilities. Sublease payments to the Company total $32.4 million and are not netted from the amounts presented in the above table. The Company has agreements with Savanna Drilling, LLC, Highlands Drilling, LLC, Patterson, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling and other drilling contractors to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company. These obligations totaled approximately $52.8 million as of December 31, 2010. The other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program and the 2008 Executive Performance Incentive Program. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. Effective 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Value Driver Award program. The Company may adopt other plans in the future. The contractual obligations do not include any payments under the 2011 Value Driver Award program or any potential future plans. As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total liability for the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 of $41.5 million. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company has established reserves for pending litigation, which it believes are adequate, and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingent liabilities and commitments. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon EQTs Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Companys Audit Committee, relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Con solidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit. The depletion rate is derived by di viding the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves. The carrying values of the Companys proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. In order to determine whether impairment has occurred, the Company estimates the expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties. The estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves, utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset, market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable. Those properties would be written down to fair value, which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis. Indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. If it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made. Unproved properties had a net book value of $445.9 million, $105.9 million and $81.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves, a process which can be significantly impacted by managements expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans. Should the Company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities, future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Oil and Gas Reserves: The Company adopted the SEC rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, as of December 31, 2009. Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10, are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Companys 47 Table of Contents engineers and reviewed by the Companys independent engineers. Revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements. The Company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12 month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Income Taxes: The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans and pension and other post retirement benefits recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. No other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. The Company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. If this step is satisfied, then the Company must measure the tax position. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit realizable upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine wheth er, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. In making this determination, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. Evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that an uncertain tax 48 Table of Contents position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Derivative Commodity Instruments: The Company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices. Derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not design ated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. See Commodity Risk Management above, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding hedging activities. The Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use as inputs market based parameters, including but not limited to forward curves, discount rates, broker quotes, volatilities and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Companys credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterpartys credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Companys or counterpartys credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available.& #160; The values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. A substantial majority of the Companys derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be de designated, the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings, which could materially impact the results of operations. One of the requirements for hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged. Effectiveness may be impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective. The Company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads, credit ratings, credit default swap rates and market activity. In addition, the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the Company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the Company to margin requirements. Given the Companys price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are critical accounting estimates because the Companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the Companys derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of non performance risk and by changes in margin requirements. Contingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results. The Company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Companys plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company increases the carrying amount of 49 Table of Contents the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value, through charges to depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets. The Company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems, and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Share Based Compensation: The Company has awarded share based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 Long Term Incentive Plans. The Company treats certain of its Executive Performance Incentive Programs, including the 2008 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2008 EPIP) and the 2007 Supply Long Term Incentive Program (2007 Supply Program) as liability awards. The actual cost to be recorded for these plans will not be known until the measurement date, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date. The Company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate p ayouts. Approximately 70,000 units were granted under the 2008 EPIP. The payout of this program will be between zero and three times this number of units valued at the price of the Companys common stock at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2011. The payout multiple is dependent upon the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer groups total shareholder return and the downward discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors if the Company does not attain a specified revenue target. As of December 31, 2010, 265,850 awards were outstanding under the 2007 Supply Program. The awards earned were increased to the maximum of three times the initial award based upon achievement of the predetermined production sales revenue and efficiency targets. The performance period for the 2007 Supply Program ended on December 31, 2010. Assuming no change in the current payout multiple assumptions for 2008 EPIP, a 10% increase in the Companys stock price assumption would have resulted in an increase in 2010 compensation expense under this plan of approximately $0.2 million. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the 2010 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2010 Program) and the 2010 Stock Incentive Award (2010 SIA) program. The vesting of the units under the 2010 Program will occur upon payment after the end of the 3 year performance period. The payment will vary between zero and 300% of the number of units granted contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a redefined peer group over the three year period ending December 31, 2012 and the level of production sales revenues over the period January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2012. If earned, the 2010 Program units are expected to be distributed in Company common stock. The vesting of the awards under the 2010 SIA will occur on the third anniversary of the grant date. The number of awards granted was contingent upon adjusted 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) performance as compared to plan and individual, business unit and Company value driver performance over the period January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. As of February 2, 2011, there were 302,355 awards outstanding under the 2010 SIA which are expected to be distributed in Company common stock. Effective 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Volume and Efficiency Program and the 2011 Value Driver Award program. The Company may adopt other plans in the future. The Company has not recorded an obligation under the 2011 Volume and Efficiency Program, the 2011 Value Driver Award program or any potential future plans at December 31, 2010. 50 Table of Contents The 1999 and 2009 Long Term Incentive Plans permit the grant of restricted stock awards and non qualified stock options to employees of the Company. For time restricted stock awards, compensation expense, which is based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The majority of the time based restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the three year period commencing with the date of grant. For non qualified stock options, compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term.& #160; The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Companys stock. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share based compensation are critical accounting estimates because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the Companys shares, the volatility of the Companys shares, market interest rates and the various performance factors. The impact on net income of these changes can be material. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Commodity Instruments The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and NGLs, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily through the EQT Production and EQT Midstream segments. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption Commodity Risk Management in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K. The Company uses non leveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is continually monitored. The Company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices.& #160; The Companys use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. Commodity Price Risk For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Companys forecasted production, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk, the Company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company include futures contracts, swap agreements, collar agreements and option contracts which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity. The Company also considers other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy. Management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to ensure an adequate level of return for the well development and infrastructure investment at EQT Production and EQT Midstream. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2010, the Company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2015 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 162 Bcf of natural gas. See the Commodity Risk Management in the Capital Resources and Liquidity sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K for further discussion. 51 Table of Contents The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10% increase or a 10% decrease in commodity prices. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2010 levels would increase the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $65.0 million. A hypothetical increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2010 levels would decrease the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $62.7 million. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, resulting in the change in fair value. The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the Companys physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, a change to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced ab ove would be offset by the impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected. If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur, or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. Other Market Risks The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value. The Company believes that NYMEX traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants, including the Company, from any potential financial instability of the exchange members. The Companys swap, collar and option derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole. The Company utilizes various processes and analysis to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures. This includes closely monitoring current market conditions, counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits. To manage the level of credit risk, the Company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better, enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security. Approximately 69%, or $216.4 million, of OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010 have a positive fair value. As of December 31, 2010, all derivative contracts outstanding are with counterparties having an S&P rating of A or above at that date. In September 2008, the credit support provider of one counterparty (Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc.) declared bankruptcy resulting in a default under various derivative contracts with the Company. As a result, those contracts were terminated and a reserve of approximately $5 million was recorded against the entire balance due to the Company. There is no additional income statement exposure to this counterparty beyond the reserve recorded in 2008. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was not in default under any derivative contract and has no knowledge of default by any counterparty to a derivative contract. The Company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal non performance risk adjustment 52 Table of Contents included in the Companys established fair value procedure. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas. A significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from EQT Production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas to certain marketers, including the Companys wholly owned marketing subsidiary EQT Energy, utility and industrial customers located mainly in the Appalachian area and a gas processor in Kentucky. Additionally, a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from EQT Midstream are generated from the gathering of natural gas in Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures on December 8, 2014. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 20 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding under the facility $53.7 million of loans in support of corporate activities and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of $23.5 million. No single lender of the 20 financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. The Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the Companys exposure if problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry. 53 Table of Contents
