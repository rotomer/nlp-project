Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations In 2011 EQT achieved record results. Highlights for 2011 include: Record annual production sales volumes of 194.4 Bcfe, 44% higher than in 2010; Marcellus proved reserves increased by 19%; Unit lease operating expense, excluding production taxes (LOE), decreased 17% in 2011, to $0.20 per Mcfe. Including production taxes, LOE was $0.40 per Mcfe; and Record EQT Midstream throughput and operating income. EQTs consolidated net income for 2011 was $479.8 million, $3.19 per diluted share, compared with $227.7 million, $1.57 per diluted share, for 2010 and $156.9 million, $1.19 per diluted share, for 2009. In 2011, the Company recorded $128.3 million of after tax gains on dispositions related to the sales of Langley and Big Sandy as described in Item I, Business. Operating income increased to $861.3 million in 2011 from $470.5 million in 2010. In addition to the $202.9 million pre tax gain on the dispositions of Big Sandy and Langley and the absence of revenues and expenses associated with these assets, operating income was favorably impacted by increased production sales volumes and higher gathering and transmission revenues which more than offset the increase in operating expenses associated with higher volumes, lower storage and marketing net operating revenues and a lower average wellhead sales price to EQT Corporation. Production sales volumes increased more than 44% in 2011 from 2010, largely associated with the Marcellus play, as a result of increased production from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys producing wells. Gathered revenues increased as a result of a 32% increase in gathered volumes primarily related to the Companys production growth. Transmission net revenues increased as a result of higher firm transportation activity and capacity from the Equitrans 2010 Marcellus expansion project. The average wellhead sales price to EQT Corporation including the effect of the Companys hedging program was $5.37 per Mcfe in 2011 compared to $5.62 per Mcfe in 2010. Hedging activities resulted in an increase in the average natural gas sales price of $0.55 per Mcf in both 2011 and 2010. 30 Table of Contents Operating expenses for 2011 increased $77.6 million compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increased production depletion and expenses on higher produced volumes as well as higher selling, general and administrative expenses consistent with the growth of the business. These increases were partially offset by the absence of expenses associated with Big Sandy and Langley, primarily operating and maintenance expenses, and favorable adjustments for certain non income tax matters. The $70.8 million increase in net income from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to increased production sales volumes, higher gathering revenues, increased net revenues for NGLs, lower long term incentive compensation expense and lower exploration expense. These favorable variances were partially offset by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, lower average wellhead sales prices and lower storage and marketing revenues. EQT revenues for 2010 increased approximately 5% compared to 2009 revenues. Production sales volumes increased more than 34% from 2009 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys producing wells. Gathered volumes increased due to the Companys production growth and infrastructure expansion. Residential revenues increased as a result of the Companys base rate increases in February 2009 and August 2010. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decline in the average wellhead sales price to EQT Corporation as a result of lower hedge prices year over year which more than offset slightly increased natural gas commodity and NGL prices and a 7% decline in storage and marketing revenues primarily resulting from lower margins on asset optimization activities. Operating expenses for 2010 decreased approximately 5% compared to 2009. This decline was primarily attributable to a $108.0 million decrease in purchased gas costs due to lower recoverable commodity costs, a $39.3 million decrease in long term incentive compensation expense and a $12.5 million decrease in the Companys exploration program. The decrease in exploration expense was primarily a result of a reduction in the level of purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties. These decreases were partially offset by higher depletion resulting from increased investment in oil and gas producing properties.

Business Segment Results Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Companys consolidated results based on operating income. Interest, income taxes and other income are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters annual operating budget. Differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses totaling $29.3 million, $15.1 million and $62.2 million, respectively, were not allocated to the operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 32 Table of Contents The Company has reported the components of each segments operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQTs management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQTs segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest, income taxes and other income. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. The Companys management reviews and reports Production segment results for operating revenues and purchased gas costs with transportation costs reflected as a deduction from operating revenues as management believes this presentation provides a more useful view of net wellhead price and is consistent with industry practices. Third party transportation costs are reported as a component of purchased gas costs in the consolidated results. The Company has reconciled each segments operating income to the Companys consolidated operating income and net income in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b) Capital expenditures in the EQT Production segment include $92.6 million of liabilities assumed in exchange for producing properties as part of the ANPI transaction in 2011 and $230.7 million of undeveloped property which was acquired with EQT common stock in 2010. (c) Production taxes include severance and production related ad valorem and other property taxes. Year Ended December 31, 2011 vs. December 31, 2010 EQT Productions operating income totaled $387.1 million for 2011 compared to $223.5 million for 2010, an increase of $163.6 million between years, primarily due to increased production sales volumes and higher wellhead sales prices to EQT Production, partially offset by an increase in DD&A and operating costs resulting from higher volumes. Total net operating revenues were $791.3 million for 2011 compared to $537.7 million for 2010. The $253.6 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a 44% increase in production sales volumes as well as a 3% increase in the average wellhead sales price to EQT Production. The increase in sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus, as well as the acquisition of producing properties associated with the ANPI transaction, as described in Item 1, Business, in May 2011 which added 5.5 Bcfe of sales volumes in 2011. This increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells. The $0.11 per Mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price to EQT Production was primarily due to lower gathering rates and higher sales prices for NGLs and oil in the current year partially offset by an 8% decrease in the average NYMEX price compared to 2010. The average wellhead sales price was also impacted favorably from selling excess transmission capacity on the Tennessee Gas Pipeline 300 Line in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating expenses totaled $404.2 million for 2011 compared to $314.2 million for 2010. The 29% increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased DD&A, production taxes and LOE. The depletion expense increased as a result of higher volumes in the current year partially offset by a slightly lower overall depletion rate. Production taxes increased due to higher revenues and increased assessments in certain jurisdictions that impose these taxes in the year of production. The increase in LOE was primarily the result of increased activity in 2011 as well as the elimination, as part of the ANPI transaction, of certain operating expense reimbursement 34 Table of Contents agreements. Lower costs for road and location maintenance due to less severe weather in the current year partly offset these increases. SG&A increased due to higher overhead and commercial services costs associated with the growth of the company and higher franchise tax expense. These increases were partially mitigated by a charge in 2010 related to the buy out of excess contractual capacity for water treatment and lower professional services, hiring and relocation costs in 2011. Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. December 31, 2009 EQT Productions operating income totaled $223.5 million for 2010 compared to $185.9 million for 2009, an increase of $37.6 million between years, primarily due to increased production sales volumes, partially offset by a lower average wellhead sales price and an increase in depletion and SG&A expenses. Total operating revenues were $537.7 million for 2010 compared to $421.0 million for 2009. The $116.7 million increase in operating revenues was due to increased sales volumes which more than offset lower average realized wellhead sales prices. The increase in gas sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus and Huron plays. This increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the Companys wells. The $0.18 per Mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price to EQT Production was primarily due to lower hedging gains and lower hedged gas sales volumes compared to 2009, partially offset by a 10% increase in the average NYMEX price and a higher sales price for NGLs. Operating expenses totaled $314.2 million for 2010 compared to $235.1 million for 2009. The 34% increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increases of $66.3 million in DD&A, $20.9 million in SG&A and $2.6 million in LOE partially offset by a decrease of $12.5 million in exploration expense. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from increases in the blended depletion unit rate and volume. The $0.20 per Mcfe increase in the blended depletion unit rate was primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to the reversal of reserves in the prior year for certain legal disputes; higher personnel costs including incentive compensation and hiring and relocation costs, a portion of which was recorded at headquarters in prior years; a charge for the buy out of excess contractual capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water; and an increase in professional fees. Despite the 20% decrease in the average LOE per Mcfe, total LOE increased as a result of increased activity in the Marcellus play in the current year. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in exploration expense due to a reduction in geophysical activity compared to the prior year as well as an impairment charge in 2009 on an exploratory Utica well. 35 Table of Contents EQT Midstream Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 % change 2011 2010 2009 % change 2010 2009 OPERATIONAL DATA Gathering and processing: Gathered volumes (BBtu) 258,179 195,642 32.0 161,480 21.2 Average gathering fee ($/MMBtu) $ 0.97 $ 1.11 (12.6 ) $ 1.04 6.7 Gathering and compression expense ($/MMBtu) (a) $ 0.30 $ 0.37 (18.9 ) $ 0.42 (11.9 ) Transmission pipeline throughput (BBtu) 159,384 109,165 46.0 84,132 29.8 Net operating revenues (thousands): Gathering $ 249,607 $ 212,170 17.6 $ 165,519 28.2 Transmission 90,405 84,190 7.4 76,749 9.7 Storage, marketing and other 64,614 100,097 (35.4 ) 107,530 (6.9 ) Total net operating revenues $ 404,626 $ 396,457 2.1 $ 349,798 13.3 Unrealized (losses) gains on derivatives and inventory (thousands) (b) $ (755 ) $ (379 ) 99.2 $ 206 (284.0 ) Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 242,886 $ 193,128 25.8 $ 201,082 (4.0 ) FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 525,345 $ 580,698 (9.5 ) $ 465,444 24.8 Purchased gas costs 120,719 184,241 (34.5 ) 115,646 59.3 Total net operating revenues 404,626 396,457 2.1 349,798 13.3 Operating expenses: Operating and maintenance (O&M) 83,907 107,601 (22.0 ) 95,164 13.1 SG&A 49,901 48,127 3.7 47,146 2.1 DD&A 57,135 61,863 (7.6 ) 53,291 16.1 Total operating expenses 190,943 217,591 (12.2 ) 195,601 11.2 Gain on dispositions 202,928 100.0 Operating income $ 416,611 $ 178,866 132.9 $ 154,197 16.0 (a) Gathering and compression expense for the full year 2011 excludes $7.1 million of favorable adjustments for certain non income tax reserves. (b) Included in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues. 36 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 vs. December 31, 2010 EQT Midstreams operating income totaled $416.6 million for 2011, including gains on the dispositions of Langley and Big Sandy of $202.9 million, compared to $178.9 million for 2010. In addition to the gains, operating income increased as a result of increased gathering and transmission volumes combined with lower operating expenses. These favorable variances were partially offset by decreased storage, marketing and other net operating revenues and a lower average gathering fee. Total net operating revenues were $404.6 million for 2011 compared to $396.5 million for 2010. The increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $37.4 million increase in gathering net operating revenues and a $6.2 million increase in transmission net operating revenues, partly offset by a $35.5 million decrease in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues. Gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 32% increase in gathered volumes, partially offset by a 13% decrease in the average gathering fee. This increase in gathered volumes was driven primarily by higher produced natural gas volumes gathered for EQT Production in the Marcellus play. The decrease in the average gathering fee was a result of lower gathering rates charged to affiliates and other shippers in the Marcellus play. Transmission net revenues increased in 2011 as a result of higher firm transportation activity from affiliated shippers due to the increased Marcellus volumes and increased capacity from the Equitrans 2010 Marcellus expansion project, partly offset by the absence of revenues from the sold Big Sandy Pipeline. Storage, marketing and other net revenue decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in natural gas volumes marketed for third parties utilizing pipeline capacity, lower net revenue from natural gas liquids marketed for non affiliated producers, lower margins due to reduced commodity prices and lower price spreads and volatility. Higher NGL prices were more than offset by the loss of processing fees associated with the sale of Langley. Total operating revenues decreased by $55.4 million or 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales prices on decreased commercial activity and a lower gathering rate partially offset by an increase in gathered volumes and increased transmission revenue. Total purchased gas costs decreased as a result of decreased commercial activity. Operating expenses totaled $190.9 million for 2011 compared to $217.6 million for 2010. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases of $23.7 million in O&M and $4.7 million in DD&A. The decrease in O&M is primarily due to the absence of operating expenses associated with Langley and Big Sandy and reductions in certain non income property tax reserves partly offset by increased compensation costs. The decrease in DD&A was primarily due to the sales of Big Sandy and Langley, partly offset by increased depreciation on increased investment in gathering and compression infrastructure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. December 31, 2009 EQT Midstreams operating income totaled $178.9 million for 2010 compared to $154.2 million for 2009. The $24.7 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased gathering volumes and gathering rates, partially offset by decreased storage, marketing and other net operating revenues and increased operating expenses. Total net operating revenues were $396.5 million for 2010 compared to $349.8 million for 2009. The $46.7 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a $46.7 million increase in gathering net operating revenues and a $7.4 million increase in transmission net operating revenues, partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in storage, marketing and other net operating revenues. Gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 21% increase in gathered volumes as well as a 7% increase in the average gathering fee. The increased revenue was driven primarily by higher Marcellus volumes from EQT Production. 37 Table of Contents Transmission net revenues in 2010 increased from the prior year primarily as a result of higher firm transportation activity from affiliated shippers due to the increased Marcellus volumes and increased capacity from the Equitrans 2010 Marcellus expansion project, which came on line during the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in storage, marketing and other net revenues was primarily due to decreased margins and volumes of third party marketing that utilized pipeline capacity, less volatility in seasonal price spreads and decreased basis differentials which in 2009 had a positive impact on the Company. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in NGL processing net revenues primarily due to an increase in average NGL sales price. Total operating revenues increased by $115.3 million, or 25%, primarily as a result of increased marketed volumes due to higher Marcellus activity and higher gathered volumes. Total purchased gas costs also increased as a result of higher Marcellus activity. Operating expenses totaled $217.6 million for 2010 compared to $195.6 million for 2009. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $12.4 million in O&M and $8.6 million in DD&A. The increase in O&M is primarily due to higher electricity, labor, and non income taxes associated with the growth of the business as well as a $2.6 million loss on compressor decommissioning at Langley. The increase in DD&A was primarily due to the increased investment in gathering and transmission infrastructure. 38 Table of Contents Distribution Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 % change 2011 2010 2009 % change 2010 2009 OPERATIONAL DATA Heating degree days (30 year average 5,710) 5,189 5,516 (5.9 ) 5,474 0.8 Residential sales and transportation volume (MMcf) 22,333 23,132 (3.5 ) 23,098 0.1 Commercial and industrial volume (MMcf) 28,752 27,124 6.0 30,521 (11.1 ) Total throughput (MMcf) 51,085 50,256 1.6 53,619 (6.3 ) Net operating revenues (thousands): Residential $ 115,912 $ 117,418 (1.3 ) $ 111,007 5.8 Commercial & industrial 48,968 48,614 0.7 47,432 2.5 Off system and energy services 22,672 21,365 6.1 21,545 (0.8 ) Total net operating revenues $ 187,552 $ 187,397 0.1 $ 179,984 4.1 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 31,313 $ 36,619 (14.5 ) $ 33,707 8.6 FINANCIAL DATA (thousands) Total operating revenues $ 419,678 $ 474,143 (11.5 ) $ 560,283 (15.4 ) Purchased gas costs 232,126 286,746 (19.0 ) 380,299 (24.6 ) Net operating revenues 187,552 187,397 0.1 179,984 4.1 Operating expenses: O & M 43,383 44,047 (1.5 ) 43,663 0.9 SG&A 31,524 35,994 (12.4 ) 35,028 2.8 DD&A 25,747 24,174 6.5 22,375 8.0 Total operating expenses 100,654 104,215 (3.4 ) 101,066 3.1 Operating income $ 86,898 $ 83,182 4.5 $ 78,918 5.4 Year Ended December 31, 2011 vs. December 31, 2010 Distributions operating income totaled $86.9 million for 2011 compared to $83.2 million for 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of an increase in estimated recoverable costs in 2011, an increase in the Companys West Virginia base rates and lower operating expenses. These increases were partly offset by warmer weather. Net operating revenues were $187.6 million for 2011 compared to $187.4 million for 2010 as an increase in estimated recoverable costs in 2011 was substantially offset by a decrease in residential net operating revenues. Net operating revenues from residential customers decreased $1.5 million as a result of warmer weather partially offset by the full year impact of the Companys West Virginia base rate increase, which was approved in August 2010. The weather in Distributions service territory in 2011 was 6% warmer than 2010 and 9% warmer than the territorys 30 year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration average. Commercial and industrial net revenues increased $0.4 million primarily as a result of an increase in usage by one industrial customer. The high volume sales to this industrial customer had low unit margins and did not ratably impact total net operating 39 Table of Contents revenues. Off system and energy services net operating revenues were higher as a result of a change in estimated recoverable costs in 2011 offset by fewer asset optimization opportunities realized in 2011. A decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates and fewer asset optimization transactions resulted in a decrease in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs. Operating expenses totaled $100.7 million for 2011 compared to $104.2 million for 2010. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of lower bad debt expense and the reduction of certain non income tax reserves resulting from settlements with tax authorities. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other compensation related costs and depreciation expense in 2011. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily the result of a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates and the Companys favorable collections experience. Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. December 31, 2009 Distributions operating income totaled $83.2 million for 2010 compared to $78.9 million for 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in base rates which was partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net operating revenues were $187.4 million for 2010 compared to $180.0 million for 2009. The $7.4 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily the result of an increase in residential net operating revenues. Net operating revenues from residential customers increased $6.4 million as a result of the approval of the Companys Pennsylvania base rate increase in late February 2009 as well as the approval of the Companys West Virginia base rate increase in August 2010. Commercial and industrial net revenues increased $1.2 million due to higher base rates and an increase in performance based revenues, partially offset by a decrease in usage by one industrial customer. High volume sales to this industrial customer had low unit margins and the decrease in sales volumes did not ratably impact total net operating revenues. Off system and energy services net operating revenues decreased due to lower margins on asset optimization activities, partially offset by increased gathering revenue as a result of higher rates. A decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates and a decrease in gas costs associated with asset optimization transactions resulted in a decrease in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs. Operating expenses totaled $104.2 million for 2010 compared to $101.1 million for 2009. The $3.1 million increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher bad debt and depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in bad debt expense from 2009 to 2010 was primarily the result of a favorable one time adjustment in the allowance for uncollectible accounts in 2009 due to the recovery of CAP costs associated with the approval of the Pennsylvania rate case settlement. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accruals for certain non income tax reserves in 2009 and a decrease in incentive compensation costs in 2010. The increase in DD&A expense was primarily the result of increased capital expenditures. Other Income Statement Items Other Income Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Thousands) Other income $34,138 $12,898 $8,585 Other income includes equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments, primarily the Companys investment in Nora Gathering LLC, of $7.2 million, $9.7 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Other income increased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the $10.1 million pre tax gain on the ANPI transaction, an $8.5 million gain on sales of available for sale securities and an increase in the equity portion of AFUDC as a result of construction on the Equitrans Sunrise Pipeline project. Other income for the year ended 2010 also included a $2.1 million gain on sales of available for sale securities. 40 Table of Contents Interest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Thousands) Interest expense $136,328 $128,157 $111,779 Interest expense increased by $8.2 million from 2010 to 2011 as a result of the Companys continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during the year. The increase in interest from the Companys November 2011 issuance of $750 million 4.875% notes and the debt assumed in the May 2011 ANPI transaction was partially offset by higher capitalized interest on increased Marcellus well development. The Company also paid higher commitment fees under the terms of its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility entered into on December 8, 2010 than under the previous facility. Interest expense increased by $16.4 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the full year of expense incurred on the $700 million of 8.125% notes issued in May 2009. This increase was partially offset by a $4.4 million increase in capitalized interest primarily due to the capitalization of interest on Marcellus well development beginning in 2010, reflecting the longer time to flow gas and increased investment associated with the multi well pads. Weighted average annual interest rates on the Companys long term debt were 6.8%, 6.8%, and 6.5% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Weighted average annual interest rates on the Companys short term debt were 1.81%, 0.7% and 0.7% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Thousands) Income Taxes $279,360 $127,520 $96,668 Income tax expense increased by $151.8 million from 2010 to 2011 as a result of higher pre tax income and an increase in the Companys effective income tax rate from 35.9% to 36.8%. The Companys regulated business accounts for tax deductible repair costs as a permanent difference, as the related deferred taxes are recoverable in rates. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2011was primarily the result of the tax benefit for these repair costs being higher in 2010 than in 2011. State income taxes were also higher due to a shift in the Companys non regulated business to states with higher income tax rates. Other rate reconciling items had a larger percentage impact on the effective tax rate in 2010 than 2011 due to significantly higher pre tax income in 2011. Income tax expense increased by $30.9 million from 2009 to 2010 as a result of higher pre tax income which was partly offset by a lower effective tax rate. During 2010, the Companys effective income tax rate decreased from 38.1% to 35.9%. The higher tax rate in 2009 was primarily the result of the impact in 2009 of certain nondeductible expenses and the loss of certain prior year deductions as a result of carrying 2009 losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid. These higher rates in 2009 were partially mitigated by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes in 2009. Rates were also lower in 2010 due to a reduction of the reserve for uncertain tax positions. The Company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss position for 2011, 2010 and 2009 and expects to pay minimal federal income taxes for the next few years as the Companys drilling program in Appalachia continues to generate intangible drilling cost deductions, unless tax laws change or the Company incurs a taxable gain from a discrete transaction. In 2011 the sales of Langley and Big Sandy resulted in the Company paying federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes totaling approximately $49.6 million. For federal income tax purposes, the Company deducts approximately 84% of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (IDC) in the year incurred. The primary reasons for the Companys net operating loss are the IDC deduction resulting from the Companys drilling program and the accelerated tax deprecation for expansion of gathering infrastructure which 41 Table of Contents provide tax deductions in excess of book deductions. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes. Outlook The Company is committed to profitably developing its Marcellus reserves through environmentally responsible, cost effective, technologically advanced horizontal drilling. The market price for natural gas can be volatile as demonstrated by significant declines in late 2011 and early 2012. In response to these lower prices, the Company has suspended drilling new Huron wells. Wells currently in progress will be completed and turned in line. Changes in the market price for natural gas impact the Companys revenues, earnings and liquidity. The Company is unable to predict potential future movements in the market price for natural gas and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations; however, the Company monitors the market for natural gas and adjusts strategy and operations as deemed appropriate. After adjusting for the change in drilling plans for 2012, capital expenditures for well development (primarily drilling) in 2012 are expected to be approximately $1,055 million to support the drilling of approximately 158 gross wells, including 146 gross Marcellus wells and 12 gross Huron wells which were either spud in January 2012 or are required to maintain lease rights. Sales volumes are expected to be between 250 and 255 Bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 30% in 2012. In addition, the Company plans to spend $365 million on midstream infrastructure in 2012 to support this production growth and expects gathering and transmission volumes to increase as a result of this expansion. EQT Midstream plans to add 445 MMcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity and 700 MMcfe per day of transmission capacity in 2012. This includes 300 MMcfe per day of transmission volumes from the Sunrise Pipeline project which is expected to go into service in 2012. The Company currently believes that the 2012 capital spending plan will be funded by cash flow generated from operations and cash on hand. Capital Resources and Liquidity The Companys primary sources of cash for 2011 were cash flows from operating activities, and proceeds from the issuance of senior debt and asset sales. The Companys primary use of cash in 2011 was for capital expenditures. Operating Activities The Companys net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was $915.3 million compared to $789.7 million for the same period of 2010. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher operating receipts as a result of increased production in 2011, which more than offset the negative cash flow impact of paying $47.2 million in taxes in 2011 compared to receiving tax refunds of $129.5 million in 2010. The Companys net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was $789.7 million compared to $725.7 million for 2009. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher earnings resulting from increased production volumes and higher NGL prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $624.3 million for 2011 as compared to $1,239.4 million for 2010. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to 2011 proceeds from the sales of Big Sandy, Langley and available for sale securities. Capital expenditures increased $27.3 million to $1,274.3 million in 2011. See discussion of capital expenditures below. 42 Table of Contents Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1,239.4 million for 2010 as compared to $985.5 million for 2009. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures to $1,246.9 million in 2010 from $963.9 million in 2009. See discussion of capital expenditures below. This increase was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and reduced capital contributions to Nora Gathering, LLC. Capital Expenditures 2012 Forecast 2011 Actual 2010 Actual 2009 Actual Well development (primarily drilling) $ 1,055 million $ 938 million $ 888 million $ 686 million Property acquisitions $ $ 150 million $ 358 million $ 31 million Midstream infrastructure $ 365 million $ 243 million $ 193 million $ 201 million Distribution infrastructure and other corporate items $ 35 million $ 36 million $ 39 million $ 46 million Total $ 1,455 million $ 1,367 million $ 1,478 million $ 964 million Less: non cash $ $ 93 million $ 231 million $ Total cash capital expenditures $ 1,455 million $ 1,274 million $ 1,247 million $ 964 million Capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $938 million and $888 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company drilled 222 gross wells (213 net wells) in 2011, including 105 horizontal Marcellus wells with approximately 500,000 feet of pay and 115 horizontal Huron wells with approximately 550,000 feet of pay, compared to 489 gross wells (395 net wells) in 2010, including 90 horizontal Marcellus wells with approximately 300,000 feet of pay and 236 horizontal Huron wells with approximately 1.0 million feet of pay. Capital expenditures for 2011 also included $57 million for undeveloped property acquisitions, primarily within the Marcellus play and $93 million of liabilities assumed in exchange for producing properties in the ANPI transaction. Capital expenditures for 2010 included $358 million for undeveloped property acquisitions, $231 million of which was non cash. Capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled $243 million for 2011. During the year, EQT Midstream turned in line 46 miles of pipeline and 20,000 horse power of compression primarily in the Marcellus play. During 2010, midstream capital expenditures were $193 million. EQT Midstream turned in line 132 miles of pipeline and 21,000 horse power of compression primarily within the Huron play in 2010. Capital expenditures at Distribution totaled $31 million and $37 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, principally for pipeline replacement. The Company is committed to profitably developing its Marcellus reserves through environmentally responsible, cost effective, technologically advanced horizontal drilling. In response to lower prices, the Company suspended drilling new Huron wells in January 2012. Wells currently in progress will be completed and turned in line. After adjusting for the change in drilling plans for 2012, capital spending for well development (primarily drilling) is expected to be approximately $1,055 million to support the drilling of approximately 158 gross wells, including 146 gross Marcellus wells and 12 Huron wells which were either spud in January 2012 or are required to maintain lease rights. Sales volumes are expected to be between 250 and 255 Bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 30% in 2012. In addition, the Company plans to spend $365 million on midstream infrastructure in 2012 to support its production growth and expects gathering and transmission volumes to increase as a result this expansion. EQT Midstream plans to add 445 MMcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity and 700 MMcfe per day of transmission capacity in 2012. This includes 300 MMcfe per day of transmission volumes from the Sunrise Pipeline project which is expected to go into service in 2012. 43 Table of Contents The Company currently believes that 2012 capital expenditures will be funded by cash flow generated from operations and cash on hand. Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $540.3 million for 2011 as compared to $449.7 million for 2010. During 2011, the Company issued $750 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due November 15, 2021. The proceeds of these notes are to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company also repaid short term loans of $53.7 million. In 2010, the Company received $537.2 million from a common stock offering. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $449.7 million for 2010 as compared to $259.8 million for 2009 as the proceeds from the 2010 equity offering exceeded the proceeds of the 2009 debt offering, net of repayment of short term loans. Short term Borrowings EQT primarily utilizes short term borrowings to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until they can be permanently financed, to ensure sufficient levels of inventory and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments. The amount of short term borrowings used for inventory transactions is driven by the seasonal nature of the Companys natural gas distribution and marketing operations. Margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments executed. The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures on December 8, 2014. The facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and any other lawful corporate purposes, including support of any commercial paper program maintained by the Company from time to time. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 20 financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. The Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the Companys exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had loans of $53.7 million and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of $23.5 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company paid commitment fees averaging approximately 30 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively, to maintain credit availability under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average interest rate for short term loans outstanding as of December 31, 2010 was 1.81%. The maximum amount of outstanding short term loans at any time during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $104.0 million and $139.7 million respectively. The average daily balance of short term loans outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $5.5 million and $24.9 million, respectively, at weighted average annual interest rates of 1.81% and 0.70% respectively. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, the Company may obtain base rate loans or fixed period Eurodollar rate loans. Base rate loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the Companys then current credit rating. Fixed period Eurodollar rate loans bear interest at a Eurodollar rate plus a margin based on the Companys then current credit rating. The Companys short term borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less. Security Ratings and Financing Triggers The table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the Company at December 31, 2011. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Companys cost of short term and long term debt (including interest rates 44 Table of Contents and fees under its lines of credit), collateral requirements under derivative instruments and its access to the credit markets. Unsecured Medium Term Commercial Rating Service Notes Paper Moodys Investors Service Baa2 P 2 Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB A 3 Fitch Ratings Service BBB F2 On November 1, 2011, S&P affirmed its rating on EQT and revised the rating outlook from negative to stable. On November 2, 2011, Fitch affirmed its rating on EQT and affirmed the rating outlook at stable. On November 2, 2011, Moodys affirmed its rating on EQT and revised the rating outlook from stable to negative. The Companys credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the credit rating agencies downgrade the Companys ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Companys access to the capital markets may be limited, margin deposits on derivative contracts and borrowing costs would increase, counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. The required margin is subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. The Companys debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. The most significant default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Companys credit facilitys financial covenants require a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all existing debt covenants. Commodity Risk Management The substantial majority of the Companys commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the Companys produced natural gas. The Companys overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The Companys risk management program may include the use of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts and options and OTC natural gas swap agreements and options (collectively, derivative commodity instruments) to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily fixed prices swaps, collars and futures. 45 Table of Contents The approximate volumes and prices of the Companys hedge position for 2012 through 2014 production are: 2012 2013 2014 Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 101 70 42 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 5.20 $ 5.15 $ 4.82 Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 21 15 14 Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 6.51 $ 6.12 $ 6.37 Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX)* $ 11.83 $ 11.80 $ 11.55 * The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in Item 7A and Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Items Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic operations in December 2005, the Company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of NORESCO. The savings guarantees provided that once the energy efficiency construction was completed by NORESCO, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years. The undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees is approximately $213 million as of December 31, 2011, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 16 years. In addition, the Company agreed to maintain in place certain outstanding payment and performance bonds, letters of credit and other guarantee obligations supporting NORESCOs obligations under certain customer contracts, existing leases and other items with an undiscounted maximum exposure to the Company as of December 31, 2011 of approximately $35 million, of which approximately $34 million relates to bonds that were to have been terminated as of December 31, 2010 for work completed under the underlying contracts. The Company is working with NORESCO to resolve any open matters with respect to these bonds. In exchange for the Companys agreement to maintain these guarantee obligations, the purchaser of the NORESCO business and NORESCO agreed, among other things, that NORESCO would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and agreed to reimburse the Company for any loss under the guarantee obligations, provided that the purchasers reimbursement obligation will not exceed $6 million in the aggregate and will expire on November 18, 2014. In 2008, the original purchaser of NORESCO sold its interest in NORESCO and transferred its obligations to a third party. In connection with that event, the new owner delivered to the Company a $1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations. The NORESCO guarantees are exempt from FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees. The Company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity. As such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees. Rate Regulation The Companys distribution operations, transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed. As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory accounting allows the Company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The 46 Table of Contents Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. Schedule of Contractual Obligations Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017+ (Thousands) Purchase obligations $ 2,331,443 $ 192,157 $ 313,501 $ 352,418 $ 1,473,367 Long term debt 2,740,885 219,315 34,366 169,004 2,318,200 Interest payments 1,269,473 171,401 319,622 306,182 472,268 Operating leases 200,259 39,875 67,375 26,244 66,765 Pension and other post retirement benefits 160,230 10,115 19,631 17,596 112,888 Other liabilities 33,678 14,564 19,114 Total contractual obligations $ 6,735,968 $ 647,427 $ 773,609 $ 871,444 $ 4,443,488 Purchase obligations primarily are commitments for demand charges under existing long term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines, some of which extend up to approximately 15 years. Approximately $17.6 million and $3.5 million of these obligations payable in 2012 and 2013, respectively, are believed to be recoverable in customer rates. The Company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties. Amounts included in the above table for capacity released under long term agreements approximate $61.8 million, $47.5 million and $20.4 million in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the Companys drilling program. The obligations for the Companys various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $110.1 million as of December 31, 2011. The Company has subleased some of these facilities. Sublease payments to the Company total $30.2 million and are not netted from the amounts presented in the above table. The Company has agreements with Savanna Drilling, LLC, Pioneer Drilling Company and Patterson Drilling Company, to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company over the next four years. These obligations totaled approximately $90.2 million as of December 31, 2011. The other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2011 Value Driver Award program. See section titled Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total liability for the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 of $33.0 million, of which $19.4 million reduces the net operating loss carryover. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company accrues legal or other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. The Company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingent liabilities and commitments. 47 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon EQTs Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Companys Audit Committee, relate to the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit. The depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves. The carrying values of the Companys proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. In order to determine whether impairment has occurred, the Company estimates the expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties. The estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves, utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset, market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable. Those properties would be written down to fair value, which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis. Indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. If it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made. Unproved properties had a net book value of $358.8 million, $445.9 million and $105.9 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves, a process which can be significantly impacted by managements expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans. Should the Company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities, future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Oil and Gas Reserves: Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S X Rule 4 10, are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Companys engineers and audited by the Companys independent engineers. Revisions may result from changes in, among 48 Table of Contents other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements. The Company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12 month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because the Company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Income Taxes: The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans and pension and other post retirement benefits recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized. No other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. The Company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. If this step is satisfied, then the Company must measure the tax position. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit realizable upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. In making this determination, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. Evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the Companys current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including the Companys anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the Company. To the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include 49 Table of Contents an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Derivative Commodity Instruments: The Company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production. The Company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales, to hedge natural gas inventory and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Energy trading contracts are also utilized to leverage assets and limit exposure to shifts in market prices. Derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the value of fair value hedges are offset with changes in the value of the hedged item (inventory). See Commodity Risk Management above, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding hedging activities. The Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use as inputs market based parameters, including but not limited to forward curves, discount rates, broker quotes, volatilities and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Companys credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterpartys credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Companys or counterpartys credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available. The values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. A substantial majority of the Companys derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be de designated, the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings, which could materially impact the results of operations. One of the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged. Effectiveness may be impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective. The Company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads, credit ratings, credit default swap rates and market activity. In addition, the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the Company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the Company to margin requirements. Given the Companys price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are critical accounting estimates because the Companys financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the Companys derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, by changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of non performance risk and by changes in margin requirements. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Contingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results. 50 Table of Contents The Company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Companys plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company increases the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value, through charges to depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets. The Company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems, and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Share Based Compensation: The Company has awarded share based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 Long Term Incentive Plans. The Company treats certain of its programs as liability awards. The actual cost to be recorded for these programs will not be known until the measurement date, requiring the Company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date. The Company reviews the assumptions for liability programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts. Awards that pay in stock are treated as equity awards. These programs may require estimates of total number of shares to be issued depending on performance conditions or may be fixed because of a market condition. Fixed plans require the Company to obtain a valuation which includes assumptions including the expected term of the award, the risk free rate and expected volatility based on the historical performance of the Company and its peers. Effective in 2010, the Company adopted the 2010 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2010 EPIP) and the 2010 Stock Incentive Award (2010 SIA) program. The vesting of the units under the 2010 EPIP will occur upon payment after the end of the 3 year performance period. The payment will vary between zero and 300% of the number of units granted contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a pre defined peer group over the three year period ending December 31, 2012 and the level of production sales revenues over the period January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2012. If earned, the 2010 EPIP units are expected to be distributed in Company common stock. The vesting of the awards under the 2010 SIA will occur on the third anniversary of the grant date. The number of awards granted was contingent upon adjusted 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) performance as compared to the Companys annual business plan and individual, business unit and Company value driver performance over the period January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, 295,635 confirmed performance awards were outstanding under the 2010 SIA which are expected to be distributed in Company common stock. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Volume and Efficiency Program (2011 VEP) and the 2011 Value Driver Award program (2011 VDA). A total of 260,330 awards were granted under the 2011 VEP. The payout of the 2011 VEP awards will range from zero to three times the initial award based on the achievement of pre determined specified performance measures. Payment of the awards is expected to be distributed in Company stock after the end of the performance period, December 31, 2013. The Company accounts for these awards as equity awards using the $48.09 grant date fair value which was equal to the Companys stock price at the grant date of the award. Under the 2011VDA, 50% of the units awarded vested upon the payment date following the first anniversary of the grant date; the remaining 50% of the units awarded will vest upon the payment date following the second anniversary of the grant date. The payment under this plan varied between zero and 300% of the number of units granted contingent upon adjusted 2011 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) performance as compared to the Companys annual business plan and individual, business unit and Company value 51 Table of Contents driver performance over the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, 523,347 confirmed awards were outstanding under the 2011 VDA. Half of the awards were distributed in cash in February 2012. The remainder of the awards are expected to vest and be paid in cash in the first quarter of 2013. Effective 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Value Driver Award program (2012 VDA) and the 2012 Executive Performance Incentive Program (2012 EPIP). The Company may adopt other plans in the future. The Company has not recorded an obligation under the 2012 VDA, the 2012 EPIP or any potential future plans at December 31, 2011. The 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan permits, and the 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan permitted, the grant of restricted stock awards and non qualified stock options to employees of the Company. For time restricted stock awards, compensation expense, which is based on the grant date fair value, is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The majority of the time based restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the three year period commencing with the date of grant. For non qualified stock options, compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Companys stock. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share based compensation are critical accounting estimates because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the Companys shares. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Derivative Commodity Instruments The Companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and NGLs, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily through EQT Production and the storage, marketing and other activities at EQT Midstream. The Companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption Commodity Risk Management in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K. The Company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is regularly monitored. The Company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales, to hedge natural gas inventory and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys use of derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Companys Corporate Risk Committee and Board of Directors. Commodity Price Risk For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Companys forecasted production, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk. For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk and to hedge natural gas inventory which is exposed to changes in fair value, the Company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels. The financial instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity. The Company also considers other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy. 52 Table of Contents The Company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. The Companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading as of December 31, 2011, the Company hedged portions of expected equity production, portions of forecasted purchases and sales and portions of natural gas inventory by utilizing futures contracts, swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 347 Bcf of natural gas. See the Commodity Risk Management in the Capital Resources and Liquidity sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) of this Form 10 K for further discussion. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2011 levels would increase the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $129.1 million. A hypothetical increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the December 31, 2011 levels would decrease the fair value of non trading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately $128.1 million. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The price change was then applied to the non trading natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, resulting in the change in fair value. The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the Companys physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods. Furthermore, the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected. If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first. Interest Rate Risk Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the Company earns on cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate it pays on borrowings under the revolving credit facility. All of the Companys long term borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the Company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt. See Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys borrowings and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of fair value measurements, including the fair value of long term debt. In August 2011, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this swap. Other Market Risks The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value, which may change as market prices change. The Company believes that NYMEX traded futures contracts have limited credit risk because the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants, including the 53 Table of Contents Company, from any potential financial instability of the exchange members. The Companys swap and collar derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole. The Company utilizes various processes and analysis to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures. This includes monitoring current market conditions, counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits. To manage the level of credit risk, the Company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade, enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security. Approximately 81%, or $508.5 million, of OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 have a positive fair value. All derivative contracts outstanding were with counterparties having an S&P rating of A or above on December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was not in default under any derivative contracts and has no knowledge of default by any counterparty to derivative contracts. The Company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal non performance risk adjustment included in the Companys established fair value procedure. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas. A significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from EQT Production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas, NGLs and crude oil to marketers, utility and industrial customers located mainly in the Appalachian area and a gas processor in Kentucky. Additionally, a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from EQT Midstream are generated from the gathering of natural gas in Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures on December 8, 2014. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 20 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its pro rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the facility. No single lender of the 20 financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. The Companys large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the Companys exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry. 54 Table of Contents
