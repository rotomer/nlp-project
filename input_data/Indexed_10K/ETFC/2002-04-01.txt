Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements Statements made in this document, other than statements of historical information, are forward looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements may sometimes be identified by words such as expect, may, looking forward, we plan, we believe, are planned, could have, could be, and currently anticipate. Although we believe these statements, as well as other oral and written forward looking statements made by or on behalf of E*TRADE Group, Inc. from time to time, to be true and reasonable, we can give no assurance that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are set forth in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in this document under the heading Risk Factors, beginning on page 70 and in this section captioned Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution that the risks and factors discussed below and in such filings are not exclusive. We do not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of E*TRADE Financial. Overview E*TRADE Group, Inc. (E*TRADE Group, the Company, or we), a financial services holding company, is a provider of personalized online financial services offering value added investing, banking, lending, planning and advice to our customers through services provided by our wholly owned subsidiaries, including but not limited to, E*TRADE Securities, Incorporated (E*TRADE Securities), a securities broker dealer, E*TRADE Institutional, a provider of global securities brokerage and other related services to institutional clients, ETFC, a provider of financial services whose primary business is conducted by its subsidiary, E*TRADE Bank (the Bank), a federally chartered savings bank that provides deposit accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to customers nationwide. Our business is discussed in greater detail in this Form 10 K in Item 1. Business. On January 22, 2001, our fiscal year end was changed from September 30 to December 31. During the three months ended December 31, 2000 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, we expanded and diversified our business through several strategic acquisitions. Through our acquisition in February 2001 of 45 Table of Contents LoansDirect, Inc., which merged into and was renamed E*TRADE Mortgage Corporation effective June 15, 2001 (E*TRADE Mortgage), we began offering mortgage loans. Through our acquisitions of Web Street, Inc. (Web Street) and Dempsey and Company, LLC (Dempsey), we expanded our Domestic Retail Brokerage business by offering market making services and increasing our account base. In October 2000, we also enhanced our wealth management business through the acquisition of PrivateAccounts, renamed E*TRADE Advisory Services, a platform which aggregates the services of individual money managers and investment advisers and launched Stock Baskets, which enables our customers to set up dollar denominated, personalized portfolios via the Internet. All of our acquisitions from October 2000 through the end of 2001 have been accounted for under the purchase method and, accordingly, the operating results of these entities have been combined with those of the Company since the dates of acquisition. Summary of Critical Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because we operate in the financial services industry, we follow certain accounting guidance used by the brokerage and banking industries. One of the more significant impacts of these rules is that interest income and expense from our lending and banking activities, as well as gains and losses from sales of loans and bank investments, are included in net revenues, whereas corporate interest income and expense, as well as gains and losses on corporate investments, are reported as non operating income or expense. In addition, our consolidated balance sheet is not separated into current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. Also, certain financial assets, such as mortgage backed and investment securities are carried at fair market value in our consolidated balance sheet, while other assets, such as loans receivable, are carried at historic values. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented and actual results could differ from our estimates. Critical accounting estimates, which are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and which require complex, subjective judgments, are as follows: Accrued restructuring costs; Determination of the allowance for loan losses; The classification and carrying value of investments; Accounting for financial derivatives; Recognition of deferred tax assets; and The valuation of goodwill. Accrued restructuring costs On August 29, 2001, we announced a restructuring plan aimed at streamlining operations and enhancing profitability by consolidating facilities in the United States and Europe. The restructuring resulted in a pre tax charge of $202.8 million in fiscal 2001, and is more fully described under the caption Facility Restructuring and Other Nonrecurring Charges. This charge included the write off of assets totaling approximately $96.8 million, while the remainder represents cash obligations. As of December 31, 2001, our estimated future cash obligations were $89.5 million. This includes rental payments due for certain facilities no longer to be used by the Company totaling $170.4 million, offset by our best estimate of the future sublease income we expect to receive. In calculating the charge related to our facilities consolidation, certain estimates were made including time to vacate facilities, sublease terms upon the negotiation of future leases, broker commissions, tenant 46 Table of Contents improvements and operating costs. In developing our estimates, we obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income. In calculating the undiscounted value of ongoing lease commitments for facilities expected to be vacated or unused, we considered ongoing facility needs and the time required to vacate facilities and execute on our restructuring plan. Market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to vacate premises and sublease facilities ahead of schedule, or the negotiation of lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated, will affect our accrual and the related restructuring charge. Differences between estimates of related broker commissions, tenant improvements and operating costs may increase or decrease the accrual upon final negotiation. We recorded a reduction in our initial facility consolidation charge of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 primarily because we were able to utilize a larger portion of our furniture and fixtures than originally estimated. Determination of the allowance for loan losses Through the Bank, we originate and purchase mortgage and consumer loans that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay off. We may not collect all contractual principal and interest on some of these loans that we have originated or purchased. To the extent these uncollectible loans are not adequately reserved for, we may incur additional charges to loan losses in the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers to be adequate to absorb loan losses inherent in the portfolio. In determining the level of the allowance the company has established both specific and general allowances. The amount of the specific allowance is determined through a loan by loan analysis of certain large dollar real estate and consumer loans. Loans not specifically reviewed by management are evaluated using expected loss ratios. The expected loss ratios are determined based on historical charge off experience, industry loss experience and current market and economic conditions. At December 31, 2001, our loan loss allowance was $19.9 million on total loans of $7,992 million. The purpose of the allowance for loan losses is to provide for losses that are probable to have occurred as of the balance sheet date, and not to predict future losses in the loan portfolio. The determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires management to make significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of losses and current market and economic conditions. These estimates are susceptible to change. Accordingly, a continued decline in the national economy or the economies in the areas in which the Banks loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies or foreclosures, resulting in the need for additional loan loss allowances in future periods. In addition, the regulatory agencies that supervise the Bank periodically reviews the Banks allowance for loan losses. This review, which is an integral part of their examination process, may result in additions or deductions to the allowance for loan losses based on judgments with regard to available information provided at the time of their examinations. In addition to our banking loans described above, we also extend credit to our brokerage customers in the form of margin loans. At December 31, 2001, margin accounts were approximately $1,537 million and we had provided an allowance for uncollectible amounts of $3.6 million, which was based on historical experience as well as a review of individual customer accounts. The classification and carrying value of investments We generally classify our investment in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The fair value of these securities are determined by obtaining quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income and excluded from our earnings. Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other than temporary are included in earnings. 47 Table of Contents We have investments in several publicly traded and privately held companies. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we evaluate our corporate holdings of these companies for declines in market value that may be other than temporary. Our policy is to recognize such declines when the market value of a companys stock is less than our cost for a period of six months, unless there are other indicators that such declines should be recognized sooner. During fiscal 2001, we recognized losses of $43.5 million from declines in market value which we determined to be other than temporary related to investments in publicly traded companies, mutual funds in which we are the sponsor, and other joint venture investments. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2001, certain of the publicly traded equity securities which we held had unrecognized losses of $1.1 million, which we believed to be temporary and so this decline was not included in the computation of our earnings. Our investments include direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. We have made significant investments in venture capital funds, which invest in privately held companies. In addition to the potential for financial returns, our venture activities increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies. Certain officers of our company manage two of the venture funds. Generally accepted accounting principles require venture capital funds to adjust their investments in publicly traded and privately held companies to current market value each period. Because we account for our investment in these funds on the equity method, our earnings are impacted each period by our allocated portion of these market value changes. The determination of market value for privately held companies requires significant judgment on the part of the fund managers. The general practice in the venture capital industry, which is followed by the funds managed by our officers, is to only record an increase in fair value when it is demonstrated through a third party transaction, such as sales of stock to an unrelated investor. Decreases in fair value are generally recognized upon a similar event, or sooner if general market conditions or company specific events indicate there has been a decline in value. During fiscal 2001, we recorded losses of $34.7 million on our venture fund investments. Accounting for financial derivatives The Bank uses various financial derivatives in managing the risks inherent in its business. One of the most significant risks arises because the principal investments of the Bank are residential mortgages and other mortgage backed securities, which often pay a fixed interest rate over a long time horizon, whereas the principal source of funds to make these investments are customer deposits and short term borrowings whose interest rates are fixed for a much shorter period of time, if at all. In order to manage this differential, the Bank has purchased interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps, and floors. Under generally accepted accounting principles, all derivatives must be reflected in the balance sheet at their fair market value each period; this fair market value reflects the gain or loss implicit in the derivative. The income statement accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether or not a derivative is designated as a hedge. In order to qualify as a hedge, management must designate a derivative as a hedge of a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased, as well as continue to demonstrate that the instrument functions as an effective hedge of that item. Management has designated substantially all of the derivatives it held as of December 31, 2001 as hedges. By doing so, the balance sheet items that are hedged are adjusted to market as well as the derivative itself, resulting in a net offset to the extent that the hedge is effective, gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognized only as a component of other comprehensive income, and excluded from earning. More information concerning our derivatives is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. At December 31, 2001, as a result of interest rate changes our balance sheet hedges were in an aggregate loss position of $253.3 million, and our cash flow hedges had an aggregate gain of $119.6 million. Recognition of deferred tax assets We have recognized for financial statement purposes the tax benefits connected with losses related to our domestic operations. This recognition assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income 48 Table of Contents so that the carryforwards of these losses will be realized. The factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax asset. At December 31, 2001, we had recorded net deferred tax assets of $165.5 million. Should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of this deferred tax asset in the future, a valuation reserve against the asset would be charged to income tax expense in that period. We have also incurred losses in certain foreign countries and from certain capital transactions. We have not recorded the potential tax benefit of these losses, because we believe it is less certain that we will be able to generate income in these countries, or future domestic capital gains, sufficient to realize the carryforward benefits of these losses. At December 31, 2001, potential tax benefits of $69.4 million from these losses have been fully reserved. Valuation of goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired resulting from acquisitions made by us. We have historically amortized goodwill using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of five to twenty years. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we stopped the amortization of goodwill with an estimated net carrying value of approximately $417.6 million at December 31, 2001. Currently, we are evaluating goodwill under the SFAS No. 142s transitional impairment test and expect to record an impairment charge of approximately $300.0 million to $350.0 million, primarily attributed to the goodwill from our international acquisitions. The evaluation is based on our forecast of operating results for each of the reporting units which have recorded goodwill, as well as estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets of these units. Transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. Significant Related Party Transactions In connection with the renegotiation of our employment contract with our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and as part of other contractual renegotiations undertaken by the Company, in August 2001 we cancelled a $15.0 million note receivable and agreed to reimburse $15.2 million dollars in related taxes in return for the elimination of certain benefits contained in our Chief Executive Officers employment agreement. This action had the effect of eliminating the Companys contractual obligations to cancel the note and reimburse related taxes in the event of a change of control of the Company. The total of $30.2 million is reflected as executive loan settlement in the consolidated statement of operations. Other related party transactions are described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Transition Period As noted above, on January 22, 2001, our fiscal year end was changed from September 30 to December 31. Results for the three month transition period ended December 31, 2000 were filed in our transition report on Form 10 QT filed with the SEC on February 14, 2001. During the three month period ended December 31, 2000, we completed the following significant activities, which are described in further detail in our transition report on Form 10 QT: We completed our acquisition of privately held E*TRADE Advisory Services, a Minneapolis based developer of online separately managed accounts. We issued 618,057 shares of common stock valued at approximately $8.7 million in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of E*TRADE Advisory Services in the three month period ended December 31, 2000. The acquisition of E*TRADE Advisory Services did not materially affect the results of operations during this period. 49 Table of Contents We acquired an additional 40% ownership interest in E*TRADE Germany in October 2000, increasing our investment to 100%, for approximately 24.0 million Euros (approximately $20.2 million as of December 31, 2000) comprised of cash and common shares. The acquisition of the remaining ownership percentage of E*TRADE Germany did not materially affect the results of operations during the transition period. In November 2000, we sold our ownership interest in E*TRADE @ Net Bourse S.A. for approximately 80.5 million Euros (approximately $68.0 million). No gain or loss resulted from this transaction. On October 16, 2000, Wit Soundview Group, Inc. (Wit) completed the acquisition of E*OFFERING Corp. (E*OFFERING), a full service, Internet based investment bank in which we held a 23.6% equity interest. Under the terms of the agreement, we received common shares and warrants to purchase shares of Wit common stock, as well as the right to elect one representative to Wits Board of Directors. Concurrent with this agreement, we entered into certain other collateral arrangements whereby we acquired Wits retail brokerage business and received shares of Wit common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of Wit common stock as consideration of our entering into a strategic alliance agreement with Wit. This agreement was subsequently terminated in fiscal 2001. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 1, 2000, we adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In addition to the fair value adjustment for warrants recognized in conjunction with the Wit transaction of $6.3 million, we recognized non operating losses of $1.7 million (pre tax) reflecting the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow and fair value hedges. In December 2000, we instituted a $15 per quarter maintenance fee for low balance, inactive accounts, which is reflected in other revenues. 50 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2001, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2000, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1999 Key Performance Indicators The following tables set forth several key performance indicators used by management to measure our performance and in explaining the results of our operations for the comparative three years ended December 31, 2001, September 30, 2000 and September 30, 1999: Percentage Change December 31, 2001 September 30, 2000 September 30, 1999 2001 versus 2000 2000 versus 1999 Net new domestic brokerageaccounts 285,646 1,401,312 1,006,755 (80)% 39 % Net new banking accounts 128,296 190,671 50,383 (33)% 278 % Net new global and institutionalaccounts 29,903 58,657 9,804 (49)% 498 % Total net new accounts 443,845 1,650,640 1,066,942 (73)% 55 % Cost per net new account $ 281 $ 263 $ 245 7 % 7 % Total domestic brokeragetransactions(1) 27,125,028 42,315,785 17,257,878 (36)% 145 % Daily average domestic brokerage transactions 109,000 167,256 68,484 (35)% 144 % Average commission per domestic brokerage transaction $ 13.16 $ 15.52 $ 18.35 (15)% (15)% Rebate income per domestic brokerage transaction $ 1.85 $ 1.95 $ 2.27 (5)% (14)% Active domestic brokerage accounts 3,398,014 2,951,946 1,550,634 15 % 90 % Active banking accounts 490,913 288,073 97,402 70 % 196 % Active global and institutionalaccounts 113,927 75,416 16,759 51 % 350 % Total active accounts at periodend 4,002,854 3,315,435 1,664,795 21 % 99 % Total customer households at periodend 3,005,021 Not Available Not Available Not Available Not Available Average assets per household $ 17,586 Not Available Not Available Not Available Not Available (dollars in thousands) Total assets in domestic brokerage accounts $ 43,490,869 $ 59,901,277 $ 28,445,369 (27)% 111 % Total deposits in banking accounts 8,082,859 4,630,068 2,095,584 75 % 121 % Total assets in global and institutional accounts 1,273,328 1,348,672 306,556 (6)% 340 % Total assets/deposits in customer accounts at period end $ 52,847,056 $ 65,880,017 $ 30,847,509 (20)% 114 % (1) In fiscal year 2001, four fewer trading days are included as a result of the market closure following the events of September 11, 2001. 51 Table of Contents For purposes of the tables above: A domestic or global brokerage account is included as an active account if the account has a positive asset balance, or if a trade has been made in the account in the past six months or if the account was opened in connection with a corporate employee stock benefit program. Customers may have separate or multiple accounts for each relationship they maintain with us, including separate or multiple brokerage and banking accounts. A bank account is included as an active account if a customer has made an initial deposit and the account is not considered abandoned or dormant under applicable Federal and State laws, and the account has not been closed. Net new accounts is equal to the number of accounts opened during the applicable period that qualify as active accounts less the number of accounts deactivated due to customer attrition or because the account no longer met the definition of an active account during the reported period. A household is a collection of active accounts, as defined above, which have a matching address and last name. The following table sets forth the components of both gross and net revenues and percentage change information related to certain items on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Years Ended Percentage Change December 31, 2001 September 30, 2000 September 30, 1999 2001 Versus 2000 2000 Versus 1999 Transaction Revenues: Commissions $ 354,478 $ 656,725 $ 316,656 (46 )% 107 % Order flow 52,683 82,353 39,174 (36 )% 110 % Total transaction revenues 407,161 739,078 355,830 (45 )% 108 % Interest Income: Brokerage related 305,581 463,590 176,479 (34 )% 163 % Banking related 854,290 496,768 192,595 72 % 158 % Total interest income 1,159,871 960,358 369,074 21 % 160 % Global and institutional 152,822 166,061 124,233 (8 )% 34 % Gains on sales of originated loans 95,478 100 % % Gains on sales on Bank loans held for sale and other securities, net 75,836 8,491 6,255 793 % 36 % Other 170,947 99,195 34,291 72 % 189 % Gross revenues 2,062,115 1,973,183 889,683 5 % 122 % Interest Expense: Brokerage related 86,489 222,552 72,789 (61 )% 206 % Banking related 692,786 378,310 142,663 83 % 165 % Total interest expense 779,275 600,862 215,452 30 % 179 % Provision for loan losses 7,476 4,003 2,783 87 % 44 % Net revenues $ 1,275,364 $ 1,368,318 $ 671,448 (7 )% 104 % 52 Table of Contents Revenues Net revenues decreased 7% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 104% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The decrease in our net revenues in fiscal 2001 is mainly due to decreases in our brokerage related activities, including a decrease in transaction revenues and interest income which have been affected by the market volatility, combined with a narrowing of interest spreads reflective of the interest rate environment in the comparative periods. The sharp decline in the value of publicly traded securities has impacted the total assets in our domestic brokerage accounts, which declined 27% from September 30, 2000 to December 31, 2001 and increased 111% from September 30, 1999 to September 30, 2000. The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2000 reflected the growth in our diversified revenue streams, which included integrating our Banking operations acquired January 2000, improvements in our cross selling ability across business segments, and sustained growth in customer transaction volumes, net new active bank and brokerage customer accounts and total assets/deposits in customer accounts during a period of unprecedented growth in the Nasdaq composite index. The Nasdaq composite index reached a record high in March 2000, and then dramatically declined through the three months ended December 31, 2000, the transition period. The decline in the Nasdaq composite index continued at a slower rate through fiscal 2001, and fluctuated near Q1 fiscal year 1999 levels. Transaction Revenues Transaction revenues consist of commission revenues from Domestic Retail Brokerage transactions and payments for order flow. Transaction revenues decreased 45% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 108% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The decrease in transaction revenue in fiscal 2001 is primarily due to the stock market downturn experienced since a record high achieved in March 2000. Also contributing to the decrease in transaction revenues is the impact of the market being closed for four trading days in September 2001 following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Transaction revenue growth in fiscal 2000 reflected an increase in the level of online trading volumes in U.S. financial markets through the second quarter of fiscal 2000. Contributing to the growth in transaction revenues were (1) sustained growth in new customer accounts coupled with our Power E*TRADE program (which extends special incentives to participating, highly active customers who remained active), despite declining volumes in the market during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2000, and (2) the implementation of our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology, which has enabled us to identify and attract higher quality accounts. Volatile market conditions in the latter half of fiscal 2000, followed by a general market decline through fiscal 2001 and coupled with our focus on revenue diversification beginning in fiscal 2000, have resulted in a reduction in transaction revenues as a percentage of net revenues. Transaction revenues as a percentage of net revenues have decreased to 32% in fiscal 2001 from 54% in fiscal 2000, which remained flat from 53% in fiscal 1999. Commission revenues, which are earned as customers execute domestic securities transactions, decreased 46% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 107% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Commission revenues are primarily affected by total domestic brokerage transactions, which decreased 36% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. This decrease reflects the sustained economic downturn experienced through fiscal 2001 as unfavorable economic news impacted investor trading. The increase in commission revenue in fiscal 2000 reflects the unprecedented growth in the market through the second quarter of fiscal 2000, which was somewhat offset by a decline in the latter part of that year. Active domestic brokerage accounts increased 15% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 compared to a 90% increase from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Daily average domestic brokerage transactions decreased 32% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 compared to an increase of 144% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The average commission per domestic transaction decreased to $13.16 in fiscal 2001 from $15.52 in fiscal 2000, which decreased from $18.35 in fiscal 1999. The decline in average commission per domestic transaction is a result of promotional activities, changes in the mix of revenue generating transactions and the August 1999 implementation of the Power E*TRADE program, a component of which includes reduced 53 Table of Contents commissions for active traders. Commission revenues as a percentage of net revenues are expected to decrease as we continue to diversify revenue streams and execute on cross selling initiatives across business lines. Revenue from order flow is comprised of rebate income from various market makers and market centers that process our transactions. We use many market makers including Dempsey, a market making specialist firm which we acquired October 1, 2001, and other broker dealers to execute our customers orders and, in recent years, have derived a significant portion of our transaction revenues from these broker dealers. Rebate income from transactions processed through Dempsey subsequent to October 1, 2001 is eliminated in our consolidation. The practice of receiving payment for order flow is widespread in the securities industry. Under applicable SEC regulations, receipt of these payments requires disclosure of such payments by us to our customers. Payments for order flow decreased 36% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 110% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. This decrease primarily reflects the 36% decrease in domestic brokerage transactions processed from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and the 145% increase in domestic brokerage transactions processed from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Further impacting revenues from order flow, in January 2001, the listed marketplace implemented the move from fractional based trading to decimal based trading, commonly referred to as decimalization. The Nasdaq initiated decimalization in March 2001. The implementation of decimalization, which resulted in reduced market maker and market center spreads, has decreased the order flow payments they are willing to make. Further, with the acquisition of Dempsey in October 2001, revenue from order flow decreased in the fourth quarter to the extent we directed order flow to Dempsey. Other revenues have increased from the date of acquisition reflecting principal market making revenues earned by Dempsey of $25.9 million, offsetting the decrease in order flow revenues. The decrease in order flow revenue associated with equity transactions has been partially offset by the receipt of option order flow beginning in October 2000. We cannot be certain that rebates per transaction will continue at the same levels in future periods. However, at this time, we are unable to quantify the future impact on net revenues. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our present relationships and terms for such payments for order flow. Also, there can be no assurance that payments for order flow will continue to be permitted by the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, Inc. (NASDR) or other regulatory agencies, courts or governmental units. Loss of any or all of these revenues could harm our business. See Item 2. Risk Factors Restrictions on the ability of, or decreased willingness of, third parties to make payments for order flow or potential payments by us to third parties for handling orders could reduce our profitability. Interest Income and Expense Interest income from brokerage related activities is comprised of interest earned by our brokerage subsidiaries on credit extended to customers to finance their purchases of securities on margin, interest received from other broker dealers through our brokerage subsidiaries stock borrow programs and fees on customer assets invested in money market accounts. Interest expense from brokerage related activities is comprised of interest paid to customers on certain credit balances, interest paid to banks and interest paid to other broker dealers through our brokerage subsidiaries stock loan programs. Interest income from banking related activities reflects interest earned on assets, primarily loans receivable and mortgage backed and investment securities. Interest expense from banking related activities is comprised of interest bearing banking liabilities that include customer deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) and other borrowings. Brokerage interest income decreased 34% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 163% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The decrease in brokerage interest income in fiscal 2001 primarily reflects the overall decrease in average customer margin balances. Assets in domestic brokerage accounts totaled $43.5 billion in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 27% from $59.9 billion in fiscal 2000, which was an increase of 111% from $28.4 billion in fiscal 1999. The decrease in brokerage interest expense in fiscal 2001 is mainly due to the overall decrease in average stock loan balances. The increase in brokerage interest expense in fiscal 2000 is mainly due to an increase in the average stock loan balance and an increase in the average customer credit balance. 54 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the changes in average customer margin balances, average customer money market fund balances, average stock borrow balances, average stock loan balances and average customer credit balances for the years indicated (dollars in millions): December 31, 2001 September 30, 2000 September 30, 1999 2001 Versus 2000 2000 Versus 1999 Average customer margin balances $ 2,053 $ 4,379 $ 1,853 (53 )% 136 % Average customer money market fund balances $ 8,525 $ 6,793 $ 3,207 25 % 112 % Average stock borrow balances $ 1,270 $ 730 $ 343 74 % 113 % Average stock loan balances $ 1,761 $ 3,597 $ 1,406 (51 )% 156 % Average customer credit balances $ 1,440 $ 1,397 $ 493 3 % 183 % Banking interest income increased 72% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 158% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Increases in banking interest income reflect an increase in the average interest earning banking asset balances, fluctuations in average interest yields, increases in active banking accounts, fluctuations in net new banking accounts and increases in total deposits in banking accounts. Average interest earning banking assets increased 92% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 134% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The average yields on interest earning banking assets decreased to 6.93% in fiscal 2001 from 7.73% in fiscal 2000, which increased from 7.01% in fiscal 1999. Active banking accounts increased 70% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 196% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Net new banking accounts decreased 33% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 278% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Total deposits in banking accounts increased 75% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 121% from fiscal 1999 to 2000. Banking interest expense increased 83% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 165% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The increase in banking interest expense in fiscal 2001 reflects an increase in the average interest bearing banking liabilities offset by a decrease in the average cost of the borrowings. The increase in banking interest expense in fiscal 2000 reflects an increase in the average interest bearing banking liabilities coupled with an increase in the average cost of the borrowings. Average interest bearing banking liabilities increased 93% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 140% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The average cost decreased to 5.97% in fiscal 2001 from 6.29% in fiscal 2000, which increased from 5.69% in fiscal 1999. 55 Table of Contents The following table presents average balance data and income and expense data for our Banking operations and the related interest yields and rates for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, September 30, 2000 and September 30, 1999. The table also presents information with respect to net interest margin, an indicator of profitability. Another indicator of profitability is net interest spread, which is the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning banking assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing banking liabilities.

Changes due to changes in rate volume, which is calculated as the change in interest rate multiplied by changes in volume, have been allocated proportionately between changes in asset/liability volume and changes in interest rate.

Global and institutional revenues are comprised primarily of revenues from E*TRADE Institutional and VERSUS Technologies, Inc., now E*TRADE Technologies, Inc. (E*TRADE Technologies) operations, as well as retail brokerage related transaction revenue from our international subsidiaries. The decrease in fiscal 2001 is primarily attributable to the decrease in net new global and institutional accounts as well as a slowdown in the institutional business due to global market conditions in the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in fiscal 2000 is primarily due to strong market conditions in Asia and Europe and the emerging on line brokerage market in Canada during fiscal year 2000. The acquisition of several of our international affiliates in fiscal 2000 also resulted in increasing global and institutional revenues in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999. E*TRADE Institutionals revenues are largely comprised of commissions from institutional transaction executions. For fiscal 2001, approximately 47.4% of E*TRADE Institutionals transactions were from outside the U.S. and approximately 66.4% were from cross border transactions. 57 Table of Contents Gains on sales of originated loans Gains on the sales of originated loans of $95.5 million in fiscal year 2001 reflect the revenues contributed by E*TRADE Mortgage. Revenues generated from E*TRADE Mortgage have been combined with our revenues since February 1, 2001, the date of acquisition. Gain on Bank loans held for sale and other securities, net Gains on sales of Bank loans held for sale and other securities, consists primarily of gains on sales of bank loans and mortgage backed securities of $32.2 million and $57.4 million in fiscal 2001; $3.6 million and $3.9 million in fiscal 2000; and $2.8 million and $3.7 million in fiscal 1999, respectively. The total increased 793% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 36% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The increases in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal year 2000 are due to a significant increase in sales of the Bank loans purchased from correspondents and sales of available for sale securities in connection with the asset portfolio restructuring. The Bank actively chose to reduce its investment in mortgage backed securities and increase its investments in loans receivable, which carry a higher rate of return. Other Other revenue increased 72% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 189% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The increase in other revenues in both years primarily reflects the ATM fees recorded by E*TRADE Access since its acquisition in May 2000 and the implementation of a quarterly maintenance fee for low balance, inactive accounts in December 2000. For purposes of the quarterly maintenance fee, an inactive account is one in which there have been less than two commission generating transactions in the six months prior to quarter end. We expect to continue our policy of assessing maintenance fees for low balance, inactive accounts. Also, contributing to the increase in other revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 was the acquisition of Dempsey. Revenues from the market making activities of Dempsey of $25.9 million have been included in other revenues since its acquisition on October 1, 2001. Also included in other revenues are Business Solutions Group revenue, mutual fund revenues, revenues from fees charged for advertising on our web site, investment banking revenue, and brokerage and banking related fees for services. Provision for loan losses The provision for loan losses recorded reflects adjustments in our allowance for loan losses based upon managements review and assessment of the risk in our loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $7.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, $4.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 and $2.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999. The increase in the provision for loan losses primarily reflects the growth in and composition of our banking loan portfolio as well as the Banks decision to invest a greater portion of its assets in loans with higher yields and, therefore, increased credit risk, such as automobile loans. As of December 31, 2001, the total loan loss allowance was $19.9 million, or 0.31% of total loans held for investment or 96.1% of total non performing loans of $20.7 million. As of September 30, 2000, the total loan loss allowance was $10.9 million, or 0.26% of total loans held for investment or 91% of total non performing loans of $12.0 million. 58 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of cost of services and operating expenses and percentage change information for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2001 September 30, 2000 September 30, 1999 2001 Versus 2000 2000 Versus 1999 Cost of services $ 595,590 $ 515,571 $ 302,342 16 % 71 % Cost of services as a percentage of net revenues 47 % 38 % 45 % Operating expenses: Selling and marketing 253,422 521,532 325,449 (51 )% 60 % Technology development 88,717 142,914 79,935 (38 )% 79 % General and administrative 236,353 209,436 102,826 13 % 104 % Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 43,091 22,764 2,915 89 % 681 % Acquisition related expenses 11,174 36,427 7,174 (69 )% 408 % Facility restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 202,765 100 % Executive loan settlement 30,210 100 % Total operating expenses $ 865,732 $ 933,073 $ 518,299 (7 )% 80 % Cost of Services Cost of services increased 16% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 71% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Cost of services includes expenses related to our brokerage clearing operations, mortgage origination activities, banking operations, customer service activities, web site content costs and systems maintenance. The increases in cost of services in fiscal 2001 reflect a full year of additional expenses for the acquisition of E*TRADE Access and a partial year for the acquisitions of E*TRADE Mortgage, Web Street, and Dempsey, as well as the impact of amortizing internally developed software as a significant number of large projects were completed in November 2000. The increase in cost of services in fiscal 2000 reflects the overall increase in customer transactions processed by our brokerage and banking subsidiaries, a related increase in customer service inquiries, and operations and maintenance costs associated with our technology centers in Rancho Cordova, California and Alpharetta, Georgia. Also impacting cost of services is increased activity in our Banking segment where active customer accounts increased 70% from September 30, 2000 to December 31, 2001 and in our Global and Institutional business segments, where active customer accounts have increased 51% from September 30, 2000 to December 31, 2001. Growth in our banking and international subsidiaries combined with investment in our wealth management business resulted in an increase in cost of services in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 and in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999. These additions to costs have been partially offset by reduced clearing and other transaction related expenses as volumes have decreased year over year, and by the operating improvements described below. The initial impact of our facility restructuring, effective August 29, 2001, has also been reflected in the results of fiscal 2001, reducing our ongoing lease costs relating to vacated facilities. Cost of services has not decreased at the same level as transaction revenues because of the need to maintain an acceptable level of customer service across an account base that continues to grow and the need to service a wider range of product offerings. Looking forward, we plan to continue to identify and implement cost savings strategies in this area, including a greater integration of our bank and brokerage customer service and the implementation of a tiered customer service strategy across the organization which will include improved interactive voice response call servicing and a tier focused automated call routing system. 59 Table of Contents Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses decreased 51% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 60% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The selling and marketing expenditures reflect expenditures for advertising placements, creative development and collateral materials resulting from a variety of advertising campaigns directed at expanding brand identity, growing the customer base and increasing market share. Selling and marketing expenditures also include selling efforts in support of our Global and Institutional business segment. In fiscal 2000, we continued the momentum behind our significantly expanded marketing efforts through national television advertising and new strategic marketing alliances, as well as our first Super Bowl sponsorship. Decreases in selling and marketing expenditures from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 are primarily due to reductions in customer acquisition spending, including advertising, online and direct mailing and promotional activities. We believe marketing dollars are being spent more efficiently since we cross sell banking services to our brokerage customers in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, our strategic relationships are scaleable and structured to allow us to rapidly take advantage of market upswings and minimize risk in market downturns. Our cost per net new account totaled $281 in fiscal 2001, an increase of 7% from $263 in fiscal 2000, which was an increase of 7% from $245 in fiscal 1999. These increases are indicative of the increasing difficulty in acquiring new accounts given changing market conditions. We believe that our reduction in selling and marketing expenditures over the past year should not significantly impact our competitive position because substantial investment in marketing efforts has already been made to build a strong brand identity and because we are focusing marketing and sales resources on cross selling our services to our existing customer base, which is a less expensive way to generate and maintain business. Technology Development Technology development decreased 38% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased 79% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Costs of internally developed software are included in technology development until the specific project qualifies for capitalization treatment. Once the project is completed, these capitalized costs are amortized to cost of services. Through fiscal 2001, we continued to invest in the development of technology to enhance our existing product offerings, including enhancements to our web site and brokerage systems, and development of CRM capabilities. The decrease in technology development in fiscal 2001 reflects our focused investment on core projects, such as product offerings supporting our active trader customer base completed in fiscal 2001. Also, during the third quarter of fiscal 2001, management reviewed our current technology development activities in conjunction with our restructuring plans and business initiatives. As a result, work on less critical projects ceased during the last half of fiscal 2001 and the use of outside contractors was reduced. The increase in technology development in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 is due to enhancement of our existing product offerings, including maintenance of our web site and expensing of our CRM technology development costs during the preliminary project stage. With managements continuing focus on cost efficiencies in fiscal 2001, no significant increases in technology development spending are planned in fiscal 2002. Management believes that the level of current technology development spending is appropriate to support pending initiatives and to operate competitively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased 13% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 104% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 is primarily due to the growth of our Banking segment, which includes the operations of E*TRADE Access and E*TRADE Mortgage. Also, we implemented our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) on January 1, 2001, which increased general and administrative expenses by $24.5 million in fiscal 2001. We expect to continue to fund the SERP in future years. The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a reduction in spending on corporate overhead expense and an increased focus on spending controls. In addition, the initial 60 Table of Contents impact of our facility restructuring and other nonrecurring charges, effective August 29, 2001, has been reflected in fiscal 2001. The significant increase in fiscal 2000 is a result of personnel additions and the development of administrative functions resulting from our overall growth and increased business activities. Looking forward, we expect that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat with fiscal 2001, with some increases related to our operations of Dempsey, offset by possible reductions from integration of our past business acquisitions, and our ongoing efforts to re engineer and reorganize our business to realize operating efficiencies from these acquisitions. Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was $43.1 million in fiscal 2001, $22.8 million in fiscal 2000 and $2.9 million in fiscal 1999. The significant increase in the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is primarily related to the purchase acquisitions of E*TRADE Access in May 2000, E*TRADE Germany in October 2000, E*TRADE Mortgage in February 2001, Web Street in June 2001, and several of our international affiliates. At December 31, 2001, unamortized goodwill and workforce intangibles are $561.4 million and unamortized other intangibles are $123 million, comprised primarily of intangibles related to Web Street and Dempsey accounts upon acquisition. Other intangibles are amortized over 5 to 30 years. With the release of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill attributed to purchase acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 is no longer amortized. As a result, the goodwill recorded upon the purchase of Dempsey is not being amortized. Upon our adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, we discontinued the amortization of goodwill subject to the new pronouncement. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Acquisition Related Expenses Acquisition related expenses were $11.2 million in fiscal 2001, $36.4 million in fiscal 2000 and $7.2 million in fiscal 1999. In fiscal 2001, acquisition related expenses include approximately $5.8 million related to losses incurred by Web Street during the transition of Web Streets accounts to our systems. The transition of Web Streets accounts was completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, at which time all of Web Streets domestic stand alone operations ceased. Also included in acquisition related expenses during fiscal 2001 was approximately $4.9 million paid under a management continuity agreement in connection with the acquisition of Dempsey in October 2001. Acquisition related expenses in fiscal 2000 primarily relate to transaction costs associated with the acquisitions of ETFC and E*TRADE Technologies. In fiscal 1999, acquisition related expenses were incurred primarily in connection with the acquisitions of E*TRADE Institutional, ClearStation and ETFC. Facility Restructuring and Other Nonrecurring Charges On August 29, 2001, we announced a restructuring plan aimed at streamlining operations primarily by consolidating facilities in the United States and Europe. This restructuring resulted in a pre tax charge of $202.8 million ($148.0 million after tax) in fiscal 2001. Over the past three years, we have completed more than 16 acquisitions of companies with facilities in major metropolitan centers in the United States and Europe. The restructuring was designed to consolidate some of these facilities to bring together key decision makers and streamline operations. As discussed in our summary of critical policies and estimates portion of managements discussion and analysis, we have recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $131.8 million related to our facilities consolidation at September 30, 2001 (adjusted by $3.3 million at December 31, 2001), representing the undiscounted value of ongoing lease commitments offset by anticipated third party subleases. The charge also includes a pre tax write off of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures totaling $38.6 million. The charge does not include relocation costs that will be incurred over the next 12 months and expensed as incurred. The cash outflow related to this action will be paid out over the length of our committed lease terms of 7 to 11 years. 61 Table of Contents As a result of our worldwide consolidation activities, certain software developed for specific locations and certain other fixed assets will no longer be used. In addition, management reviewed our current technology development activities and decided to focus on projects generating the highest return in the short term. As such, work on less critical projects has ceased. In total, we recorded a pre tax charge of $52.5 million related to the write off of capitalized software and hardware related to certain technology projects and other fixed assets. In calculating the charge related to our asset write off, we calculated the amount of write offs as the net book value of assets less the amount of estimated proceeds upon disposition for certain saleable assets. The increase to our initial asset write off charge of $49.4 million to $52.5 million reflects the identification of additional excess equipment. The restructuring accrual also included other pre tax charges of $15.8 million for committed expenses, termination of consulting agreements and cancellation penalties on various services, that will no longer be required in the facilities the Company is vacating. We recorded an increase to our initial restructuring charge included in Other of $5.9 million for severance payments made to associates identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a part of our consolidation and integration efforts. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, severance is recorded in the period in which associates are identified and communication is made to these individuals (See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Executive Loan Settlement In connection with the renegotiation of our employment contract with our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and as part of other contractual renegotiations undertaken by the Company, in August 2001 we cancelled a $15.0 million note receivable and agreed to reimburse $15.2 million dollars in related taxes in return for the elimination of certain benefits contained in our Chief Executive Officers employment agreement. This action had the effect of eliminating the Companys contractual obligations to cancel the note and reimburse related taxes in the event of a change of control of the Company. The total of $30.2 million is reflected as executive loan settlement in the consolidated statement of operations. Other related party transactions are described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Interest Income Corporate interest income was $22.2 million in fiscal 2001, $17.2 million in fiscal 2000 and $20.7 million in fiscal 1999. Corporate interest income primarily relates to interest income earned on corporate investment balances, restricted cash balances, and related party notes. The increase in corporate interest income was primarily due to an increase in our corporate investment activity during fiscal 2001, reflecting the initial use of proceeds from the issuance of $325 million ($315.3 million, net of issuance costs) of 6.75% convertible subordinated notes in May 2001 and interest income earned on related party notes, which were entered into during the period from March 2000 through June 2001. Corporate Interest Expense Corporate interest expense was $52.9 million in fiscal 2001, $29.5 million in fiscal 2000 and $100,000 in fiscal 1999. The increase in corporate interest expense in fiscal 2001 primarily reflects the interest expense resulting from the issuance of $325 million of 6.75% convertible subordinated notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 and interest paid on our $650 million 6% convertible notes issued during the second quarter of fiscal 2000. Beginning with the end of the second quarter in fiscal 2001 and extending through the fourth quarter, we retired 6% subordinated notes totaling $214.8 million in share and cash exchanges. The reduction in our outstanding debt balance is expected to reduce corporate interest expense by $12.9 million annually. The increase in corporate interest expense in fiscal 2000 primarily reflects the interest expense resulting from the issuance of $650 million in convertible subordinated notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2000. 62 Table of Contents Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investments Gains (losses) on investments were $(49.8) million in fiscal 2001, $211.1 million in fiscal 2000 and $54.1 in fiscal 1999. In fiscal 2001, loss on sale of investments was primarily comprised of a $(43.5) million impairment write down on publicly traded equity securities, proprietary mutual funds, and equity method and other investments. In fiscal 2000, we liquidated portions of our investment portfolio, recognizing realized gains as a result of these sales. Included in realized gains on sale of investments in fiscal 2000 is $77.5 million on the sale of a portion of our equity holdings in E*TRADE Japan K.K. following its initial public offering and realized gains of $132.3 million on the sale of other publicly traded equities. E*TRADE Japan K.K. is accounted for on the equity method. Equity in Losses of Investments Equity losses on investments were $6.2 million in fiscal 2001, $11.5 million in fiscal 2000 and $8.8 million fiscal 1999, which resulted from our minority ownership in investments that are accounted for under the equity method. Losses in fiscal 2001 reflected our investment in Wit, accounted for under the equity method until it was disposed of on August 20, 2001, and our equity investment in eAdvisor, partially offset by income recorded from our equity investments in E*TRADE Japan K.K. and AG Arbor, Inc. In fiscal 2000, losses resulted from our minority ownership in investments that are accounted for under the equity method, primarily E*OFFERING. Unrealized Loss on Venture Funds Unrealized losses on venture fund were $34.7 million in fiscal 2001, $700,000 in fiscal 2000 and none in fiscal 1999. In fiscal 2001, we recorded unrealized losses on our participation in the Softbank Capital Partners, L.P. Fund, E*TRADE eCommerce Fund I (Fund I) and Arrow Path Fund II (formerly E*TRADE eCommerce Fund II). These changes represent market fluctuations on public investments held by the funds and changes in the estimated value of their non public investments. Fund I was formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 and the Arrow Path Fund II was formed in the third quarter of fiscal 2000. In October, 2001, we amended our agreement in Fund I, whereby we increased our capital commitment by $7.5 million and modified the order in which Fund I distributions are to occur. The change provides for cash contributing partners to receive priority in distribution until they reach a 15% annual rate of return on their initial investment. The securities contributing partners would then receive a 15% annual rate of return; additional distributions, if any, would be allocated proportionately to all limited partners. Most of our contribution to Fund I was made in the form of private securities and, with respect to this contribution, will be entitled to distributions behind the cash contributing partners of Fund I, which include certain of our executive officers and directors. Due to this change in allocation method, we recorded an additional equity loss of $11.1 million. Fair Value Adjustments of Financial Derivatives In fiscal 2001, we recorded a loss of $3.1 million for the fair value adjustments of financial derivatives. In fiscal 2001, the amount represents a $3.7 million loss on the valuation of warrants, partially offset by a $600,000 gain representing the ineffective portions of fair value and cash flow hedges recorded by the Bank. We owned warrants to purchase shares of common stock of Wit through August 20, 2001. The adjustment to the fair value of these warrants is reflected in the fair value adjustments of financial derivatives. We returned these warrants to Wit on August 20, 2001. Other Other non operating income (expense) was $200,000 in fiscal 2001, $(1.8) million in fiscal 2000 and $(100,000) in fiscal 1999, which is primarily comprised of foreign exchange gains (losses), recorded as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet that are denominated in non functional currencies. 63 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense (benefit) represents the expense for federal and state income taxes at an effective tax rate of (12.9)% for fiscal 2001, 81.8% for fiscal 2000 and (37.5)% for fiscal 1999. The rate for fiscal 2001 reflects a decrease in the tax benefit for non deductible expenses such as certain compensation and the amortization of goodwill, differences between our statutory and foreign effective tax rates and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized. The rate for fiscal 2000 reflects an increase in non deductible acquisition related expenses combined with the amortization of goodwill and differences between our statutory and foreign effective tax rate. These increases are primarily due to business acquisitions during fiscal 2000. The rate for fiscal 1999 reflects the impact of non deductible acquisition related expenses and amortization of goodwill arising from acquisitions. Minority Interest in Subsidiaries Minority interest in subsidiaries was $480,000 in fiscal 2001, $(181,000) in fiscal 2000 and $2.2 million in fiscal 1999. Minority interest in subsidiaries results primarily from ETFCs interest payments to subsidiary trusts which have issued Company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities and which hold junior subordinated debentures of ETFC. Also included in minority interest in subsidiaries is the net income or loss attributed to a minority interest in one of our international affiliates in fiscal year 2001 and two of our international affiliates in fiscal year 2000. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Change The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $(469,000) in fiscal 1999 resulted from the implementation by ETFC of Statement of Position 98 5, Reporting on the Cost of Start Up Activities, which requires that the cost of start up activities be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized, with the initial application reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Extraordinary Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt Extraordinary gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt was $29.3 million in fiscal 2001, none in fiscal 2000 and $(2.0) million in 1999. In fiscal 2001, extraordinary gain on early extinguishment of debt of $29.3 million (net of tax expense of $19.5 million) included a $36.0 million gain (net of tax expense of $24.0 million) from retirement of $214.8 million of our 6% convertible subordinated notes in exchange for approximately 19.2 million shares of our common stock and $15.3 million paid in cash, offset by a $6.7 million loss (net of tax benefit of $4.5 million) recorded as a result of the early redemption of $827.0 million of adjustable and fixed rate advances from the FHLB. The FHLB advances were entered into as a result of normal funding requirements of our Banking operations. The loss consisted primarily of prepayment penalties and costs associated with these early redemptions. In fiscal 1999, ETFC redeemed all of its outstanding debt. ETFC wrote off both the related premium and the remaining discount as an extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt, totaling approximately $2.0 million, net of tax. Variability of Results We expect to experience fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors, including the following: the timing of introductions or enhancements to online investing and banking services and products by us or our competitors; market acceptance of online investing and banking services and products; the pace of development of the market for online commerce; changes in trading volume in securities markets; trends in the securities and banking markets; domestic and international regulation of the brokerage and 64 Table of Contents banking industries; changes in interest rates; changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors; changes in strategy; the success of or costs associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic relationships; changes in key personnel; seasonal trends; the extent of international expansion; the mix of international and domestic revenues; changes in the level of operating expenses to support projected growth; and general economic conditions. Because of the foregoing factors, in addition to other factors that impact our operating results and financial position, investors should not consider past financial performance or managements expectations to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In that regard, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors in addition to those discussed above, including overall economic conditions. Furthermore, our stock price is subject to volatility. Any of the factors discussed above could have an adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, our stock price could be adversely affected if our revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment communitys expectations, or if there are broader, negative market trends. We do not undertake an obligation to update our forward looking statements or Risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances. See Item 7. Risk factors Risks related to owning our stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity represents our ability to raise capital to fund operations, support asset growth, and meet obligations, including deposit withdrawals, maturing liabilities and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and to otherwise meet our ongoing obligations. We have historically met our liquidity needs primarily through investing and financing activities, consisting principally of equity and debt offerings, increases in core deposit accounts, other borrowings, and sales of loans or securities. We believe that we will be able to renew or replace our funding sources at prevailing market rates, which may be higher or lower than current rates, as well as to supplement these funding sources with cash flow from operations. Equity Offerings and Retirements In fiscal 1999, E*TRADE Technologies raised aggregate net proceeds of $30.7 million and ETFC raised aggregate net proceeds of $395.9 million in their initial public offerings prior to being acquired by us. These proceeds have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements. In fiscal 2001, we repurchased and retired approximately 37.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $238.9 million. Of the 37.5 million shares repurchased, 30.5 million shares were repurchased under a multi year stock buyback program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2001 authorizing us to repurchase up to 50.0 million shares of common stock. The remaining 7 million shares were repurchased in an earlier transaction approved by our Board of Directors. Pursuant to the stock buyback program approved by the Board, we remain authorized to repurchase up to 19.5 million additional shares of common stock. Of the 37.5 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired, approximately 27.0 million shares were purchased in two private transactions with SOFTBANK Corporation, a significant shareowner of E*TRADE Group, for approximately $183.6 million. Of this total, 20.0 million shares were purchased at a price of $7.28 per share, which represented a discount from the market price on the day of sale. Debt Offerings and Retirements In the quarter ended March 31, 2000, we completed a private offering of an aggregate principal amount of $650 million of convertible subordinated notes due February 2007. The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into a total of 27.5 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $23.60 per share. The notes bear interest at 6%, payable semi annually, and are non callable for three years and may then be called by us at a premium, which declines over time. The holders have the right to require redemption at a premium in the event of a change in control or other defined redemption event. We used $145.0 million of the $631.3 million in 65 Table of Contents net proceeds to pay the outstanding balance on a $150 million line of credit, which was subsequently dissolved in February 2000. In fiscal 2001, we retired $214.8 million of these notes in exchange for 19.2 million shares of our common stock and $15.3 million in cash. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 29, 2001, the Company completed a private offering of $325 million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due May 2008. The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into a total of approximately 29.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $10.925 per share. The notes bear interest at 6.75%, payable semiannually, and are non callable for three years and may then be called by the Company at a premium, which declines over time. The holders have the right to require redemption at a premium in the event of a change in control or other defined redemption event. The net proceeds from this debt offering were used to repurchase $238.9 million of common shares, to fund merger and acquisition activity during fiscal 2001, and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs. Debt issuance costs of $10.5 million are included in other assets and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Technology Center Financing On July 30, 1999, the Company entered into a lease agreement for its 164,500 square foot technology operation center located near Atlanta, Georgia. To secure the lease, the Company had posted cash collateral, which was $71.9 million at December 31, 2001. The cash is invested in U.S. dollar certificates of deposit with an agent for the lessor, and these funds are not available for other operating cash requirements. The cash is classified in Other Assets within the consolidated financial statements. The lease payments vary based on LIBOR plus 30 basis points. The Company has the right to acquire the related property during the five year lease period at its lease purchase cost of $71.9 million. On March 27, 2002, the Company exercised its purchase option, and intends to use the cash collateral to fund the purchase. Other Sources of Liquidity We have financing facilities totaling $275 million to meet the needs of E*TRADE Securities. These facilities, if used, would be collateralized by customer securities. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines on December 31, 2001. We also have a short term line of credit for up to $50 million, collateralized by marketable securities owned by us, of which there are no borrowings as of December 31, 2001. We also have three term loans collateralized by equipment owned by us and one installment purchase contract, for which $15.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2001. We have also financed the purchase of fixed assets under capital leases totaling $18.2 million. In addition, we have entered into numerous agreements with other broker dealers to provide financing under our stock loan program. In our Banking operation, we seek to maintain a stable funding source for future periods in part by attracting core deposit accounts, which are accounts that tend to be relatively stable even in a changing interest rate environment. Typically, time deposit accounts, transactional accounts, and accounts that maintain a relatively high balance provide a relatively stable source of funding. At December 31, 2001, our average retail banking deposit account balance was approximately $19,000 and our banking customers maintained an average of 1.71 accounts. Savings and transactional deposits increased from $533.5 million at September 30, 2000 to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of 435.5%. Retail certificates of deposit increased from $4.1 billion at September 30, 2000 to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of 27.6%. Callable certificates of deposit decreased from $91.7 million at September 30, 2000 to none at December 31, 2001. We also rely on borrowed funds in our banking operations, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity. Total banking related borrowings increased 18% from $3.5 billion at September 30, 2000 to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, ETFC had approximately $2.5 billion in additional borrowing capacity. 66 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2001, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands). Due in Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total General obligations: Convertible subordinated notes(1) $ 48,053 $ 48,053 $ 48,053 $ 48,053 $ 48,053 $ 806,214 $ 1,046,479 Mandatorily redeemable preferredsecurities(1) 5,615 5,615 5,615 5,615 5,615 200,950 229,025 Operating lease payments 31,445 29,321 23,665 21,272 20,810 95,415 221,928 Technology center lease purchase exercise(2) 71,900 71,900 Venture capital funding commitments(3) 20,780 20,000 9,750 50,530 Facilities offered for sublease less estimated future subleaseincome(4) 23,981 12,399 9,161 7,631 7,067 22,126 82,365 Capital lease payments 16,106 3,031 513 114 19,764 Acquisition related employment agreements 3,600 4,800 8,400 Total general obligations(5) 221,480 123,219 96,757 82,685 81,545 1,124,705 1,730,391 Banking obligations: Certificates of deposit(6) 4,030,719 544,345 322,589 215,595 93,063 19,500 5,225,811 Borrowings by bank subsidiary 3,635,440 335,000 50,000 100,000 50,000 4,170,440 Commitments to sell securities(7) 1,555,000 1,555,000 Purchases of loans 1,577,863 1,577,863 Purchases of mortgage backed securities 90,752 90,752 Total banking obligations 10,889,774 879,345 322,589 265,595 193,063 69,500 12,619,866 Total contractual obligations $ 11,111,254 $ 1,002,564 $ 419,346 $ 348,280 $ 274,608 $ 1,194,205 $ 14,350,257 (1) Includes annual interest or dividend payments; does not assume early redemption under current call provisions.

(3) Estimated based on investment plans of the Funds. (4) Included in the facilities restructuring accrual. (5) Excludes commitments to fund certain development activities as further disclosed in Other Commitments below. (6) Does not include demand deposit, money market or passbook savings accounts, as there are no maturities and or scheduled contractual payments. (7) Fair value of commitments included as a component of the fair value of derivatives, recorded in other liabilities. See Note 24 to Consolidated Financial Statements for detail regarding the use of securities forward as a hedging activity. Other Commitments In June 1998, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK Corporation, a related party, to form E*TRADE Japan K.K. to provide online securities trading services to residents of Japan. As part of the transaction, the Company invested approximately $8.0 million in exchange for a 42% ownership position in this joint venture. E*TRADE Japan K.K. issued shares to the public in an initial public offering in September 2000. 67 Table of Contents Following E*TRADE Japan K.K.s initial public offering, we sold a portion of our investment recognizing a pre tax gain of $77.5 million, reducing our ownership percentage from 42% to 32% in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2001, E*TRADE Japan K.K. completed two additional acquisitions that resulted in a decrease of our ownership percentage to 30%. As part of our commitment to the joint venture, we are required to provide a continuing level of systems support to E*TRADE Japan K.K.; the cost of such support was $3.8 million in fiscal 2001, $629,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2000, $1.2 million in fiscal 2000 and $1.9 million in fiscal 1999. The Company does not expect development commitments under this arrangement to be material in future periods. We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced services and products, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies and or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including costs and timing of expansion of technology development efforts and the success of such efforts, the success of our existing and new service offerings and competing technological and market developments. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of the shareowners in our company will be reduced, shareowners may experience additional dilution in net book value per share or such equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to our Company, if at all. See Item 7. Risk Factors We may need additional funds in the future which may not be available and which may result in dilution of the value of our common stock. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business. See Item 7. Risk Factors If we are unable to quickly introduce new products and services that satisfy changing customer needs, we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers. Cash used in operating activities was $254.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from net loss for the year of $241.5 million, adjusted for non cash items totaling $139.3 million (including depreciation and amortization expenses of $179.1 million, the non cash components of our restructuring charge of $96.8 million, and realized gains on securities of $166.8 million), an excess of purchases of banking related assets over the net sale/maturity of banking related assets of $434.4 million, offset by a decrease in brokerage related assets in excess of liabilities of $325.4 million. Cash used in operating activities, net of effects from acquisitions was $138.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from net income for the year of $19.2 million, adjusted for non cash items totalling $(42.6) million (including depreciation of $97.6 million and realized gains on securities of $219.3 million), an increase in brokerage related assets in excess of liabilities of $413.3 million, an increase in other assets of $61.3 million, offset by a decrease in banking related assets from sales and maturities in excess of new purchases of $163.1 million and an increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $199.2 million. Cash provided by operating activities, net of effects from acquisitions, was $23.8 million for the year ended September 30, 1999. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net loss of $56.8 million, adjusted for non cash items totalling $(44.5) million (including depreciation of $34.3 million and realized gains on securities of $54.7 million), an increase in brokerage related liabilities in excess of assets of $66.1 million, an increase in banking related liabilities in excess of assets of $162.7 million, and an increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $86.9 million, offset by an increase in other assets of $44.4 million and a net loss of $56.8 million. Cash used in investing activities was $1,255.2 million, $5,037.0 million and $1,833.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from an increase in loans 68 Table of Contents receivable of $2,185.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $129.7 million, partially offset by an excess of the net sale/maturity of investments over the purchases of investments of $1,183.5 million. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from an increase in loans receivable, purchases of property and equipment and an excess of the purchases of investments over the net sale/maturity of investments. Cash provided by financing activities was $1,889.2 million, $5,342.0 million and $2,000.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from an increase in banking deposits of $2,332.7 million, proceeds from convertible subordinated notes of $315.3 million and a net increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $368.6 million, offset by a net reduction on advances from the FHLB of $830.7 million. For the year ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from an increase in banking deposits, net advances from the FHLB and a net increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, offset by payments on advances from the FHLB and, in fiscal 2000, proceeds from convertible subordinated notes. Regulatory Capital Requirements The SEC, NASDR, OTS and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and regulatory capital by banks. Net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets. Minimum net capital requirements for our broker dealer subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 were fully met. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier I capital to risk weighted assets, Core Capital to adjusted tangible assets and of Tangible Capital to tangible assets. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain a minimum Total Capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 10.0%, Tier I Capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 6.0% and Core Capital to adjusted tangible assets ratio of 5.0%. As of December 31, 2001, the Bank was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements and its capital ratios exceeded the ratios for well capitalized institutions under OTS regulations (See Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. The acquisition of Dempsey occurred subsequent to June 30, 2001, and has been accounted for in accordance with SFAS Nos. 141 and 142; accordingly, the goodwill recognized of $143.8 million was not amortized during the year ended December 31, 2001. For all other acquisitions previously accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will stop the amortization of goodwill with an estimated net carrying value of approximately $417.6 million at December 31, 2001 (excludes Dempsey goodwill of $143.8 million) and annual amortization expense of $27.8 million that resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 141. We are currently evaluating goodwill under the SFAS No. 142 transitional impairment test and expect to record an impairment charge of approximately $300.0 million to $350.0 million primarily attributed to the goodwill from our international acquisitions. Transitional impairment losses will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. 69 Table of Contents In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Impairment on Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, the criteria required for classifying an asset as held for sale have been significantly changed. Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their fair values or carrying amounts and depreciation is no longer recognized. In addition, the expected future operating losses from discontinued operations will be displayed in discontinued operations in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date. More dispositions will qualify for discontinued operations treatment in the income statement under the new rules. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 144 to our consolidated financial statements. RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATING TO THE NATURE OF THE ONLINE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS We face competition from competitors, some of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, which could cause us to lower our prices or to lose a significant portion of our market share The market for financial services over the Internet is new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue and intensify in the future. We face direct competition from retail and institutional brokerage firms, banks, thrifts and other financial institutions, mortgage companies, specialists, market makers, insurance companies, electronic communication networks (ECNs), mutual fund companies, credit card companies, Internet portals, equity compensation product providers and other organizations, including, among others: American Express Company AOL Time Warner Inc.

Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors offer a wider range of investment banking, advisory and other financial services and products than we do, and thus may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and customer preferences and requirements. Many of our competitors also have greater name recognition and larger customer bases that could be leveraged, thereby gaining market share from us. These competitors may conduct more extensive promotional activities and offer better terms and lower prices to customers than we do, possibly even sparking a price war in the online financial services industry. Moreover, some of our competitors have established cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their services and products. It is possible that new competitors, alliances or consolidation (as described below) among existing competitors may significantly reduce our market share or our ability to compete effectively. Commercial banks and other financial institutions have become more competitive with our brokerage operations by offering their customers certain corporate and individual financial services traditionally provided by securities firms and more competitive with our banking operations by offering products electronically. The current trend toward consolidation in the commercial banking industry could further increase competition in all aspects of our business. While we cannot predict the type and extent of competitive services that commercial banks and other financial institutions ultimately may offer, we may be harmed by such competition. To the extent our competitors are able to attract and retain customers, our business or ability to grow could be harmed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that this competition will not significantly harm our business. If we do not act or are unable to take advantage of consolidation opportunities in the online financial services industry, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, or lose our independence Over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the online financial services industry and the consolidation is likely to continue and even accelerate in the future. Should we fail to take advantage of viable consolidation opportunities we could be placed at a disadvantage relative to our competitors who have taken appropriate advantage of these opportunities. 71 Table of Contents The security of our computers could be breached or confidential customer information transmitted over public networks could be breached or misused, which could deter customers from using our services and significantly damage our reputation Because we rely heavily on electronic communications and secure transaction processing in every aspect of our businesses, we must protect our computer systems and network from break ins, security breaches, both physical (e.g., at our ATMs and retail locations) and electronic (e.g., through hacking), and other disruptions caused by unauthorized access. We must also provide for the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks and prevent unauthorized use of confidential customer information. The open nature of the Internet makes protecting against these threats more difficult. Unauthorized access to our computers could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network, which could harm our ability to retain or attract customers, damage our reputation and subject us to litigation and financial losses. We have been in the past, and could be in the future, subject to denial of service, vandalism and other attacks on our systems. We rely on encryption and authentication technology, including cryptography technology licensed from a third party provider, to provide secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer and decryption capabilities or other developments could compromise the methods we use to protect customer transaction data, which could harm our ability to retain or attract customers. In addition, we must guard against damage, fraud, embezzlement and unauthorized trading or publication of private information by persons with authorized access to our computer systems, including individuals employed by us. The security and encryption technology and the operational procedures we implement to prevent break ins, damage and failures may be unable to prevent future disruptions of our operations. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses that may result from these events. As a significant portion of our revenues come from online investing services, downturns or disruptions in the securities markets have harmed and could further significantly harm our business, including by reducing transaction volumes and margin borrowing and increasing our dependence on our more active customers who receive lower prices A significant portion of our revenues in recent years has been from online investing services, and although we continue to diversify our revenue sources, we expect this business to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. We, like other financial services firms, are directly affected by economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance and changes in volume and price levels of securities and futures transactions. The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, for example, resulted in the closing of U.S. financial markets for an unprecedented four days. Future disruption could cause further decreased activity and may result in the continuation of market volatility and decreased investor activity referred to below. The U.S. securities markets are characterized by considerable fluctuation and downturns in these markets have harmed our operating results, including our transaction volume and the rate of growth of new accounts, and could continue to do so in the future. Significant downturns in the U.S. securities markets occurred in October 1987 and October 1989, and a significant downturn has been occurring since March 2000. Consequently, transaction volume has decreased industry wide, and many broker dealers, including E*TRADE Securities, have been adversely affected. The decrease in transaction volume has been more significant with respect to our less active customers, increasing our dependence on our more active Power E*TRADE customers who receive more favorable pricing based on their transaction volume. When transaction volume is low, our operating results are harmed in part because some of our overhead costs remain relatively fixed. The possibility exists that U.S. securities markets will continue to be volatile and that prices and transaction volumes will continue to move downward, either of which could harm our business going forward. Some of our competitors with more diverse product and service offerings might withstand such a downturn in the securities industry better than we would. 72 Table of Contents Downturns in the securities markets increase the risk that parties to margin lending or stock loan transactions with us will fail to honor their commitments and that the value of the collateral we hold in connection with those transactions will not be adequate, increasing our risk of losses from our margin lending or stock loan activities We sometimes allow customers to purchase securities on margin, and we are therefore subject to risks inherent in extending credit. This risk is especially great when the market is rapidly declining and the value of the collateral we hold could fall below the amount of a customers indebtedness. Similarly, as part of our broker dealer operations, we frequently enter into arrangements with other broker dealers for the lending of various securities. Under specific regulatory guidelines, any time we borrow or lend securities, we must correspondingly disburse or receive cash deposits. If we fail to maintain adequate cash deposit levels at all times, we run the risk of loss if there are sharp changes in market values of many securities and counterparties to the borrowing and lending transactions fail to honor their commitments. The significant downturn in equity markets since its record high in March 2000 has led to a greater risk that parties to stock lending transactions may fail to meet their commitments. Any such losses could harm our financial position and results of operations. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Developments. An inability to retain and hire skilled personnel and senior management could seriously harm our ability to maintain and grow our business If the number of accounts and transaction volume increases significantly over current volume, there could be a shortage of qualified and, in some cases, licensed personnel that we may then be seeking to hire which could cause a backlog in the handling of banking transactions, the processing of brokerage orders or the promotion and processing of insurance products that need review or could slow the growth in our customer accounts, and that could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Competition for such personnel is intense when transactions in our various products are high, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or hire technical persons or licensed representatives in the future. In addition, our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Customer Operations Officer, Members of the Office of the President and Managing Directors, Chief Finance and Administration Officer, our Board of Directors, and other key management personnel. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could compromise our ability to effectively operate our business. If our ability to correctly process customer transactions is slowed or interrupted, we could be subject to customer litigation and our reputation could be harmed We process customer transactions mostly through the Internet, online service providers, touch tone telephones, our ATM network, and our computer systems, and we depend heavily on the integrity of the communications and computer systems supporting these transactions, including our internal software programs and computer systems. A degradation or interruption in the operation of these systems, including any such degradation or interruption that is part of a widespread, concerted terrorist attack or computer virus could cause substantial customer losses and subject us to significant customer litigation and could materially harm our reputation. Our systems or any other systems in the transaction process could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including: undetected errors or holes in software programs or computer systems, our inability to effectively resolve any errors in our internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected, or heavy stress placed on systems in the transaction process during certain peak trading times. In addition, we have recently consolidated certain of our computer systems to provide for operational efficiencies. This consolidation has reduced the redundancies that were inherent in our systems to lessen or avoid 73 Table of Contents the effects of interruptions in certain of our systems. If our systems or any other systems in the transaction process slow down or fail even for a short time, our customers could suffer delays in transaction processing, which could cause substantial customer losses and may subject us to claims for these losses or to litigation. The NASDR defines a system failure as a shutdown of our mission critical systems (defined as those necessary for the acceptance and execution of online securities orders) which causes the customers use of these systems to equal or exceed system capacity during regular market hours, or a shutdown of any system application necessary for the acceptance and execution of online securities orders for a period of 15 continuous minutes that affects 25% or more of the customers on the system from effecting securities transactions during regular market hours. We have experienced systems failures and degradation in the past. Systems failures and degradations could occur with respect to U.S. markets or foreign markets where we must implement new transaction processing infrastructures. If we are unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer The results of operations for the Bank depend in large part upon the level of its net interest income, that is, the difference between interest income from interest earning assets, such as loans and mortgage backed securities, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in market interest rates (and the yield curve) could reduce the value of the Banks financial assets and thereby reduce net interest income. Fixed rate investments, mortgage backed and related securities and mortgage loans generally decline in value as interest rates rise. Many factors affect interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Currently, the Banks net interest income would be harmed by material fluctuations in interest rates. The Bank attempts to mitigate this interest rate risk by using derivative contracts that are designed to offset, in whole or in part, the variability in value or cash flow of various assets or liabilities caused by changes in interest rates. There can be no assurances that these derivative contracts move either directionally or proportionately as intended. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which we adopted on October 1, 2000, requires that the hedge ineffectiveness, or the difference between the changes in value of the hedged item versus the change in value of the hedging instruments, be recognized in earnings as of the reporting date. Our financial results may prove to be more volatile due to this reporting requirement. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Banks diversification of its asset portfolio to include higher yielding investments which carry a higher inherent risk of default in its portfolio may increase the risk of charge offs which could reduce our profitability As the Bank diversifies its asset portfolio through purchases of new higher yielding asset classes, such as auto loans and recreational vehicle loans, we will have to manage assets that carry a higher inherent risk of default than experienced with our existing portfolio. Consequently, the level of charge offs associated with these assets may be higher than previously experienced. If expectations of future charge offs increase, a simultaneous increase in the amount of our loan loss allowance would be required. The increased level of provision for loan losses recorded to meet additional loan loss allowance requirements could adversely impact our financial results if those higher yields do not cover the provision for loan losses. We rely on a number of third parties to process our transactions or provide information, products or services to our customers and their inability to meet our needs and those of our customers could impair our ability to acquire new customers and otherwise grow our business We rely on a number of third parties to process our transactions or provide information, products or services to our customers, including online and Internet service providers, back office processing organizations, market makers and other service providers. If any of these third parties are unable to sufficiently meet our needs or those 74 Table of Contents of our customers for any reason (including technology failures, capacity failures or their own bankruptcies), our business could be harmed. If we are unable to quickly introduce new products and services that satisfy changing customer needs, we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers Our future profitability depends significantly on our ability to innovate by developing and enhancing our services and products. There are significant challenges to such development and enhancement, including technical risks. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any of the following: effectively using new technologies, adapting our services and products to meet emerging industry standards, developing, introducing and marketing service and product enhancements, or developing, introducing and marketing new services and products to meet customer demand. Additionally, these new services and products, if they are developed, may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and introduce enhanced or new services and products quickly enough to respond to market or customer requirements, or if they do not achieve market acceptance, our business could be harmed. Risks associated with trading transactions at our specialist/market maker could result in trading losses A majority of our specialist and market maker revenues at Dempsey are derived from trading by Dempsey as a principal. Dempsey may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of securities for its own account. In any period, Dempsey also may incur trading losses in its specialist stocks and market maker stocks for reasons such as price declines, lack of trading volume and the required performance of specialist and market maker obligations. From time to time, Dempsey may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry. In general, because Dempseys inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis, any downward price movement in those securities will result in a reduction of our revenues and operating profits. Dempsey also operates a proprietary trading desk separately from its specialist and market maker operations. We may incur trading losses as a result of these trading activities. Although we have adopted risk management policies at Dempsey, we cannot be sure that these policies have been formulated properly to identify or limit Dempseys risks. Even if these policies are formulated properly, we cannot be sure that we will successfully implement these policies at Dempsey. As a result, we may not be able to manage our risks successfully or avoid trading losses at Dempsey. Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers and or specialists could harm our specialist and market maker business The listed marketplaces other than Nasdaq moved from trading using fractional share prices to trading using decimals in January 2001, and the Nasdaq initiated decimalization in March 2001. As a result, spreads that specialists and market makers receive in trading equity securities have declined and may continue to decline, which could harm revenues generated by Dempsey and, in turn, harm our operating results. Similarly, a reduction in the volume and or volatility of trading activity could also reduce spreads that specialists and market makers receive, also harming revenues generated by Dempsey and, in turn, our operating results. Alternative trading systems that have developed over the past few years could also reduce the levels of trading of exchange listed securities through specialists and the levels of over the counter trading through market makers, also potentially harming Dempseys, and in turn, our revenues. We cannot assure that these developments will not cause a decrease in the transaction volumes of Dempseys specialist operations. 75 Table of Contents In addition, ECNs have emerged as an alternative forum to which broker dealers and institutional investors can direct their limit orders. This allows broker dealers and institutional investors to avoid directing their trades through market makers. As a result, Dempsey may experience a reduction in its flow of limit orders. It is possible that ECNs will continue to capture a greater amount of limit order flow. If our Business Solutions Group products fail, we could be subject to litigation and our reputation may be harmed Among others, our Business Solutions Group provides products and services to assist companies to work effectively with their own legal, accounting and tax advisors to comply with the laws, regulations, and rules pertaining to equity compensation. By their nature, these products and services are highly technical and intricate, dealing with issues which could result in significant accounting and tax reporting inaccuracies for our customers. If our efforts to protect ourselves from product design limitations and or potential human error, or our efforts to limit our potential exposure, prove inadequate, these inaccuracies could subject us to customer litigation and damage our reputation. If our international efforts are not successful, our business growth will be harmed and our resources will not have been used efficiently One component of our strategy is a planned increase in efforts to attract more international customers. To date, we have limited experience in providing brokerage services internationally, and the Bank has had only limited experience providing banking services to customers outside the United States. There can be no assurance that we and or our international licensees will be able to market our branded services and products successfully in international markets. In order to expand our services globally, we must comply with the regulatory controls of each specific country in which we conduct business. Our international expansion could be limited by the compliance requirements of other regulatory jurisdictions, including the European Unions Privacy Directive regulating the use and transfer of customer data. We intend to rely primarily on local third parties and our subsidiaries for regulatory compliance in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the heavily regulated brokerage and banking industries, such as: unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, the level of investor interest in cross border trading, authentication of online customers, political instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, possible fraud, embezzlement or unauthorized trading by our associates, seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world, the level of acceptance and adoption of the Internet in international markets, and potentially adverse tax consequences. 76 Table of Contents Any of the foregoing could harm our international operations. In addition, because some of these international markets are served through license arrangements with others, we rely upon these third parties for a variety of business and regulatory compliance matters. We have limited control over the management and direction of these third parties. We run the risk that their action or inaction, including their failure to follow proper practices with respect to their own corporate governance, could harm our operations and or our reputation. Additionally, certain of our international licensees have the right to grant sublicenses. Generally, we have less control over sublicensees than we do over licensees. As a result, the risk to our operations and reputation is higher. Our failure to successfully integrate the companies that we acquire into our existing operations could harm our business In recent years, we have acquired E*TRADE Access, eInvesting, E*TRADE Advisory Services, E*TRADE Technologies, E*TRADE Mortgage, Web Street, several of our international affiliates and Dempsey. We may also acquire other companies or technologies in the future, and we regularly evaluate such opportunities. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including, but not limited to: difficulties in the assimilation and integration of acquired operations and products, diversion of managements attention from other business concerns, existence of undetected problems or potential liabilities that could have a significant, negative impact on the business or operations of the acquired company, failure to achieve anticipated cost savings, failure to retain existing customers of the acquired companies, amortization of acquired intangible assets, with the effect of reducing our reported earnings, and potential loss of key associates of acquired companies. No assurance can be given as to our ability to integrate successfully any operations, technology, personnel, services or new businesses or products that might be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate acquired organizations could harm our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on any of these investments or that any of our future acquisitions will not be dilutive to earnings. We have substantially increased our indebtedness, which may make it more difficult to make payments on our debts or to obtain financing As a result of our sale in May 2001 of $325 million in 6.75% convertible subordinated notes, offset in part by the retirement of $214.8 million of our 6% convertible subordinated notes in June through December 2001, we have incurred $110.2 million of additional convertible indebtedness. Combined with a decrease in a shareowners equity from March 31, 2001 reflecting the facility restructuring and nonrecurring charge and the effects of the share buyback program of $238.9 million, our ratio of debt (our convertible debt, capital lease obligations and term loans) to equity (expressed as a percentage) increased from approximately 37% as of September 30, 2000 to approximately 51% as of December 31, 2001. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it more difficult to make payments on our debt, make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes, limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. 77 Table of Contents If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party, we could lose our intellectual property rights, be liable for significant damages, or incur significant costs and expenses regardless of the merits of the claims against us Our ability to compete effectively is dependent to a significant degree on our brand and proprietary technology. We rely primarily on copyright, trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology and our brand. Effective trademark protection may not be available for our trademarks. Although we have registered the trademark E*TRADE in the United States and a number of other countries, and have other registered trademarks, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure significant protection for these trademarks. Our competitors or others may adopt product or service names similar to E*TRADE, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. Our inability to adequately protect the name E*TRADE or our other trademarks could harm our business. Despite any precautions we take, a third party may be able to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software or other proprietary information without authorization or develop similar software independently. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is made especially difficult by the global nature of the Internet and difficulty in controlling the ultimate destination or security of software or other data transmitted on it. The laws of other countries may afford us little or no effective protection for our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to: enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and divert resources, either of which could harm our business. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, notices of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that claims for infringement or invalidity or any indemnification claims based on such claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate, divert our attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. There can be no assurance that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Our efforts to expand recognition of the E*TRADE brand to areas of the financial services industry other than online trading may not be effective As we diversify the scope of the products and services we offer, the brand E*TRADE or E*TRADE Financial may not be as effective for us in the future, which could harm our revenues. In addition, our efforts to further our brand as a diversified financial services institution are largely dependent on our use of effective marketing and advertising efforts. If these efforts are not successful, we will not have used resources effectively. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our stockholder rights plan, stock incentive plans, contracts and management retention agreements and Delaware law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us that a shareowner may consider to be favorable Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a shareowner may consider favorable. Such provisions include: authorization for the issuance of blank check preferred stock, 78 Table of Contents provision for a classified board of directors with staggered, three year terms, the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors, a super majority voting requirement to effect business combinations or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, limits on the persons who may call special meetings of shareowners, the prohibition of shareowner action by written consent, and advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareowners at shareowner meetings. Attempts to acquire control of us may also be delayed or prevented by our stockholder rights plan. The stockholder rights plan is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to protect shareowners against, among other things, unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer an adequate price to all shareowners or are otherwise not in the best interests of us and our shareowners. In addition, certain provisions of our stock incentive plans, management retention and employment agreements (including severance payments, stock option acceleration, and loan forgiveness with associated tax gross ups), and Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. RISKS RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS If changes in government regulation, including banking and securities rules and regulations, favor our competition or restrict our business practices, our ability to attract and retain customers and our profitability may suffer The securities and banking industries in the United States are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. Broker dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, which include: sales methods, recommendations of securities, trading practices among broker dealers, execution of customers orders, use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure, record keeping, advertising, conduct of directors, officers and employees, and supervision. Because we are a self clearing broker dealer, we have to comply with many additional laws and rules. These include rules relating to possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending and execution and settlement of transactions. Our ability to comply with these rules depends largely on the establishment and maintenance of a qualified compliance system. We are also subject to additional laws and rules as a result of our specialist and market maker operations in Dempsey. Similarly, E*TRADE Group and ETFC, as savings and loan holding companies, and E*TRADE Bank, as a federally chartered savings bank and subsidiary of ETFC, are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and 79 Table of Contents examination by the OTS, and, in the case of the Bank, the FDIC. Such regulation covers all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, record keeping, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel. In addition, our Business Solutions Group manages equity compensation arrangements that are highly regulated and governed by strict accounting rules. Changes to the regulations governing such arrangements could reduce their widespread use or eliminate such arrangements altogether. Because of our international presence, we are also subject to the regulatory controls of each specific country in which we conduct business. Because we operate in an industry subject to extensive regulation, the competitive landscape in our industry can change significantly as a result of new regulation, changes in existing regulation, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules. For example, in November 1999, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act was enacted into law. This act reduces the legal barriers between banking, securities and insurance companies, and will make it easier for financial holding companies to compete directly with our securities business, as well as for our competitors in the securities business to diversify their revenues and attract additional customers through entry into the banking and insurance businesses. Over time, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act will have a material impact on the competitive landscape that we face. Similarly, in February 2001, the SEC approved amendments to National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) Rule 2520 governing margin requirements for pattern day traders which became effective September 28, 2001. Among other requirements, these amendments will require pattern day traders to have deposited in their accounts a minimum equity of $25,000 on any day in which the customer day trades. The amendments to NASD Rule 2520 could affect the behavior of certain of our most active customers and negatively impact our revenues. In addition, the recent enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and associated actions by various regulatory and industry organization and money laundering regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury Department will impose significant new suspicious activity reporting and other requirements on banks and securities broker dealers. There can be no assurance that federal, state or foreign agencies will not further regulate our business. We may also be subject to additional regulation as the market for online commerce evolves. Because of the growth in the electronic commerce market, Congress has held hearings on whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market. As a result, federal or state authorities could enact laws, rules or regulations affecting our business or operations. We may also be subject to federal, state or foreign money transmitter laws and state and foreign sales or use tax laws. If such laws are enacted or deemed applicable to us, our business or operations could be rendered more costly or burdensome, less efficient or even impossible. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. If we fail to comply with applicable securities, banking and insurance regulations, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business The SEC, the NASDR or other self regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can, among other things, censure, fine, issue cease and desist orders or suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees. The OTS may take similar action with respect to our banking activities. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of a compliance system (including proper supervisory procedures and books and records requirements), as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel. We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed noncompliance in the future, which could harm our business. If we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulators, we may be fined or forced out of business The SEC, NASDR, OTS and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and regulatory capital by banks. Net 80 Table of Contents capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets. If a securities firm fails to maintain the required net capital it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by the NASDR, and could ultimately lead to the firms liquidation. In the past, our broker dealer subsidiaries have depended largely on capital contributions by us in order to comply with net capital requirements. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require the intensive use of capital could be limited. Such operations may include investing activities, marketing and the financing of customer account balances. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from brokerage subsidiaries could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends, repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business, which could harm our business. The table below summarizes the minimum net capital requirements for our domestic broker dealer subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 (in thousands): Required Net Capital  Net Capital Excess Net Capital  E*TRADE Securities $ 34,208 $ 240,141 $ 205,933 E*TRADE Institutional Securities, Inc. $ 250 $ 6,407 $ 6,157 E*TRADE Marquette Securities, Inc. $ 250 $ 532 $ 282 E*TRADE Global Asset Management, Inc. $ 282 $ 8,999 $ 8,717 E*TRADE Canada Securities Corporation $ 100 $ 283 $ 183 Web Street Securities and subsidiary $ 250 $ 796 $ 546 Dempsey $ 802 $ 8,787 $ 7,985 GVR, LLC $ 1,000 $ 4,100 $ 3,100 Similarly, banks, such as the Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could harm a banks operations and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, a bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of a banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the strength of components of the banks capital, risk weightings of assets and off balance sheet transactions, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require a bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and of Core Capital to adjusted tangible assets. To satisfy the capital requirements for a well capitalized financial institution, a bank must maintain minimum total risk based, Tier 1 risk based, and Core Capital ratios as set forth in the following table. The table below summarizes the capital adequacy requirements for the Bank as of December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands): Actual Well Capitalized Requirements Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total Capital to risk weighted assets $ 836,866 11.52 % &gt;$ 726,233 &gt;10.0 % Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets $ 819,367 11.28 % &gt;$ 435,740 &gt; 6.0 % Core Capital to adjusted tangible assets $ 819,367 6.07 % &gt;$ 674,588 &gt; 5.0 % 81 Table of Contents Restrictions on the ability of, or decreased willingness of, third parties to make payments for order flow or potential payments by us to third parties for handling orders could affect our profitability Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate income from various market makers and market centers for processing transactions through them. There can be no assurance that payments for order flow will continue to be permitted by the SEC, the NASDR or other regulatory agencies, courts or governmental units. In addition, the listed marketplaces other than Nasdaq moved from trading using fractional share prices to trading using decimals in January 2001 and the Nasdaq initiated decimalization in March 2001. With the advent of decimalization, certain market makers have reduced payments for order flow, others have announced plans to reduce payments for order flow, and others are taking a wait and see approach. It is possible that some market makers and market centers could begin charging companies that direct order flow to them. As a majority of our order flow revenues is derived from Nasdaq listed securities, we were negatively affected by decimalization during the quarter ended September 30, 2001. The impact of decimalization on future revenues cannot be accurately predicted at this time, and a continued, general decrease in these revenues is expected. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our present relationships and terms for payments for order flow. Loss of any or all of these revenues could harm our business. Specialist rules may require Dempsey to make unprofitable trades or to refrain from making profitable trades Dempseys role as a specialist, at times, requires it to make trades that adversely affect its profitability. In addition, as a specialist, Dempsey is at times required to refrain from trading for its own account in circumstances in which it may be to Dempseys advantage to trade. For example, Dempsey may be obligated to act as a principal when buyers or sellers outnumber each other. In those instances, Dempsey may take a position counter to the market, buying or selling shares to support an orderly market in the affected stocks. In order to perform these obligations, Dempsey holds varying amounts of securities in inventory. In addition, specialists generally may not trade for their own account when public buyers are meeting public sellers in an orderly fashion and may not compete with public orders at the same price. By having to support an orderly market, maintain inventory positions and refrain from trading under some favorable conditions, Dempsey is subject to a high degree of risk. Additionally, stock exchanges periodically amend their rules and may make the rules governing Dempseys activities as a specialist more stringent or may implement other changes, which could adversely affect its trading revenues. Regulatory review of our advertising practices could hinder our ability to operate our business and result in fines and other penalties All marketing activities by E*TRADE Securities are regulated by the NASDR, and all marketing materials must be reviewed by an E*TRADE Securities Series 24 licensed principal prior to release. The NASDR has in the past asked us to revise certain marketing materials. In June 2001, we settled a formal NASDR investigation into our advertising practices and were fined by the NASDR in connection with three advertisements that were placed in 1999. The NASDR can impose certain penalties for violations of its advertising regulations, including: censures or fines, suspension of all advertising, the issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees. In addition, the federal banking agencies impose restrictions on bank advertising of non deposit investment products to minimize the likelihood of customer confusion. 82 Table of Contents If we were deemed to solicit orders from our customers or make investment recommendations, we would become subject to additional regulations that could be burdensome and subject us to fines and other penalties If we were deemed to solicit orders from our customers or make investment recommendations, we would become subject to additional rules and regulations governing, among other things, sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to customers. Compliance with these regulations could be burdensome, and, if we fail to comply, we could be subject to fines and other penalties. Due to the increasing popularity of the Internet, laws and regulations may be passed dealing with issues such as user privacy, pricing, content and quality of products and services, and those regulations could adversely affect the growth of the online financial services industry As required by the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, the SEC and OTS have recently adopted regulations on financial privacy which took effect in July 2001 that will require E*TRADE Securities and the Bank to notify consumers about the circumstances in which they may share consumers personal information with unaffiliated third parties and to give consumers the right to prohibit such information sharing in specified circumstances. Although E*TRADE Securities and the Bank already provide such opt out rights in our privacy policies, the regulations required us to modify the text and the form of presentation of our privacy policies and will require us to incur additional expense to ensure ongoing compliance with the regulations. The enactment or adoption of additional federal and state laws and regulations aimed at protecting consumers privacy may impose additional compliance costs on us and may further restrict our ability to share customer information with our affiliates and business partners. In addition, several recent reports have focused attention on the online brokerage industry. Most recently, the United States General Accounting Office issued a report citing a need for better investor protection information on brokers web sites and, on January 25, 2001, the SEC issued a report summarizing its findings and recommendations following an examination of broker dealers offering online trading. Increased attention focused upon these issues could hurt the growth of the online financial services industry, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our services or otherwise harm our business. Due to our acquisition of ETFC, we are subject to regulations that could restrict our ability to take advantage of good business opportunities and that may be burdensome to comply with Upon the completion of our acquisition of ETFC and its subsidiary, the Bank, on January 12, 2000, we became subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company. As a result, we, as well as the Bank, are required to file periodic reports with the OTS, and are subject to examination by the OTS. The OTS also has certain types of enforcement powers over ETFC and us, including the ability to issue cease and desist orders, force divestiture of the Bank, and impose civil money penalties for violations of federal banking laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, under the Graham Leach Bliley Act, our activities are now restricted to activities that are financial in nature and certain real estate related activities. We may make merchant banking investments in companies whose activities are not financial in nature, if those investments are engaged in for the purpose of appreciation and ultimate resale of the investment and we do not manage or operate the company. Such merchant banking investments may be subject to maximum holding periods and special record keeping and risk management requirements. We believe that all of our existing activities and investments are permissible under the new legislation, but the OTS has not yet interpreted these provisions. Even if all of our existing activities and investments are permissible, under the new legislation we will be constrained in pursuing future new activities that are not financial in nature. We are also limited in our ability to invest in other savings and loan holding companies. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing certain activities and transactions that could be beneficial to us. 83 Table of Contents In addition to regulation of us and ETFC as savings and loan holding companies, federal savings banks such as the Bank are subject to extensive regulation of their activities and investments, their capitalization, their risk management policies and procedures, and their relationship with affiliated companies. In addition, as a condition to approving our acquisition of ETFC, the OTS imposed various notice and other requirements, primarily a requirement that the Bank obtain prior approval from the OTS of any future material changes to the Banks business plan. Acquisitions of and mergers with other financial institutions, purchases of deposits and loan portfolios, the establishment of new Bank subsidiaries, and the commencement of new activities by Bank subsidiaries require the prior approval of the OTS. These regulations and conditions could place us at a competitive disadvantage in an environment in which consolidation within the financial services industry is prevalent. Also, these regulations and conditions could affect our ability to realize synergies from future acquisitions, could negatively affect both us and the Bank following the acquisition and could also delay or prevent the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services. We may incur costs to avoid investment company status and our business would suffer significant harm if we were deemed to be an investment company We may incur significant costs to avoid investment company status and may suffer other adverse consequences if we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, commonly referred to as the 1940 Act. A company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding 40% of its total assets, subject to certain exclusions. As a result of the sale in May 2001 of $325 million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes, we will have substantial short term investments until the net proceeds from the sale can be deployed. In addition, we and our subsidiaries have made minority equity investments in other companies that may constitute investment securities under the 1940 Act. In particular, many of our publicly traded equity investments, which are owned directly or indirectly by us or through related venture funds, are deemed to be investment securities. Although our investment securities currently comprise less than 40% of our total assets, the value of these minority investments has fluctuated in the past, and substantial appreciation in some of these investments or a decline in our total assets may, from time to time, cause the value of our investment securities to exceed 40% of our total assets. These factors may result in us being treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. We believe we are primarily engaged in a business other than investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading securities for our account and, therefore, are not an investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. However, in the event that the 40% limit was to be exceeded (including through fluctuations in the value of our investment securities), we may need to reduce our investment securities as a percentage of our total assets. This reduction can be attempted in a number of ways, including the sale of investment securities and the acquisition of non investment security assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and U.S. government securities. If we sell investment securities, we may sell them sooner than we intended. These sales may be at depressed prices and we may never realize anticipated benefits from, or may incur losses on, these investments. Some investments may not be sold due to normal contractual or legal restrictions or the inability to locate a suitable buyer. Moreover, we may incur tax liabilities if we sell these assets. We may also be unable to purchase additional investment securities that may be important to our operating strategy. If we decide to acquire non investment security assets, we may not be able to identify and acquire suitable assets, and will likely realize a lower return on any such investments. If we were deemed to be an investment company, we could become subject to substantial regulation under the 1940 Act with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, affiliate transactions and other matters. As a consequence, we could be barred from engaging in business or issuing our securities as we have in the past and might be subject to civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance. In addition, some of our contracts might be voidable, and a court appointed receiver could take control of us and liquidate our business in certain circumstances. 84 Table of Contents RISKS RELATING TO OWNING OUR STOCK Our historical quarterly results have fluctuated and do not reliably indicate future operating results We do not believe that our historical operating results should be relied upon as an indication of our future operating results. We expect to experience large fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors, including the following: fluctuations in the fair market value of our equity investments in other companies, including through existing or future private investment funds managed by us, fluctuations in interest rates, which will impact our investment and loan portfolios and the volume of our loan originations, changes in trading volume in securities markets, the success of, or costs associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic relationships, changes in key personnel, seasonal trends, purchases and sales of securities and other assets as part of the Banks portfolio restructuring efforts, customer acquisition costs, which may be affected by competitive conditions in the marketplace, the timing of introductions or enhancements to online financial services and products by us or our competitors, market acceptance of online financial services and products, domestic and international regulation of the brokerage, banking and Internet industries, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, changes in domestic or international tax rates, changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, and changes in the level of operating expenses to support projected growth. We have also experienced fluctuations in the average number of customer transactions per day. Thus, the rate of growth in customer transactions at any given time is not necessarily indicative of future transaction activity. We have incurred losses in the past and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable We have a long history of incurring operating losses in each fiscal year and we may incur operating losses in the future. We reported net income (losses) of $(241.5) million in fiscal 2001, $1.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000, $19.2 million in fiscal 2000 and $(56.8) million in fiscal 1999. Although we achieved profitability in fiscal 2000 due in part to sales of investment securities, we cannot assure you that profitability will be achieved in future periods. The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile which could cause litigation against us and the inability of shareowners to resell their shares at or above the prices at which they acquired them From January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001, the price per share of our common stock has ranged from a high of $15.38 to a low of $4.07. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to 85 Table of Contents continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to various factors, many of which may be beyond our control, including: quarterly variations in operating results, volatility in the stock market, volatility in the general economy, large block transactions in our common stock by institutional investors, changes in investor sentiment, changes in interest rates, announcements of acquisitions, technological innovations or new software, services or products by us or our competitors, and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts. In addition, there have been large fluctuations in the prices and trading volumes of securities of many technology, Internet and financial services companies. This volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock. In the past, volatility in the market price of a companys securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key associates, reduce our access to capital and otherwise harm aspects of our business. We may need additional funds in the future which may not be available and which may result in dilution of the value of our common stock In the future, we may need to raise additional funds for various purposes, including to expand our technology resources, to hire additional associates, to make acquisitions or to increase the Banks total assets or deposit base. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our business growth plans. In addition, if funds are available, the result of our issuing securities could be to dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, we have evaluated such risks for our Domestic Retail Brokerage, Banking, Global and Institutional, and Wealth Management and Other segments separately. The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors. Domestic Retail Brokerage, Global and Institutional, and Wealth Management and Other Our Domestic Retail Brokerage, Global and Institutional, and Wealth Management and Other operations are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk. However, we do not believe any such exposures are material. To reduce certain risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, none of which are held for speculative or trading purposes. 86 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity During the year ended December 31, 2001, we had a $50.0 million variable rate bank line of credit and three variable rate term loans. As of December 31, 2001, we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit and $15.0 million outstanding under these term loans. The line of credit, the term loans and the monthly interest payments are all subject to interest rate risk. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by one percent at December 31, 2001, the interest payments would increase by an immaterial amount. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consists of brokerage and investment services outside of the United States. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide our services. We are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates on the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based revenues decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based revenues increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens. We are a net payer of British pounds and, as such, benefit from a stronger dollar, and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar relative to the British pound. However, we are a net receiver of currencies other than British pounds, and as such, benefit from a weaker dollar, and are harmed by a stronger dollar relative to these currencies. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated sales and operating margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. To mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on our non U.S. dollar based revenues and operating expenses, we routinely hedge our material net non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Currently, hedges of transactions do not extend beyond twelve months and are immaterial. Given the short term nature of our foreign exchange forward and option contracts, our exposure to risk associated with currency market movement on the instruments is not material. Financial Instruments For our working capital and reserves, which are required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations, we primarily invest in money market funds, resale agreements, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Money market funds do not have maturity dates and do not present a material market risk. The other financial instruments are fixed rate investments with short maturities and do not present a material interest rate risk. Banking Operations Our banking operations acquire and manage interest bearing assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. Interest bearing instruments include investment securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and derivative financial instruments. As interest bearing, these instruments are subject to changes in market value as interest rates change. Market risk is the potential for adverse decline in market values. The market values of bank instruments have a direct or indirect impact on Bank earnings, equity and various regulatory constraints. Interest Rate Risk The acquisition, maintenance, and disposition of assets and liabilities are critical elements of the Banks operations. Throughout the process these instruments are subject to market risk, which is the potential for adverse declines in market values. There are numerous factors that may influence the speed and direction of changes in market value including, but not limited to, liquidity, the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, 87 Table of Contents and the implied volatility of future interest rate movements. The net market values of bank instruments may direct or indirectly impact the Banks current or future earnings and is also subject to certain regulatory constraints. Our Board of Directors delegates responsibility for the day to day management of market risk to the Banks Asset Liability Management Committee. The Asset Liability Management Committee is responsible for measuring, managing and reporting the Banks aggregate market risk within the policy guidelines and limits established by the Board of Directors. The Bank maintains a Risk Management Group which is independent of the Banks portfolio management functions to assist the Asset Liability Management Committee in its responsibilities of measuring and managing market risk. The market risk profile of the Bank is a net result of the combination of all interest sensitive assets, liabilities and derivatives. At December 31, 2001, approximately 86% of the market value of the Banks total assets were comprised of residential mortgages and mortgaged backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. The Banks liability structure consists primarily of transactional deposit relationships such as money market accounts, shorter term certificates of deposit, and wholesale collateralized borrowings The derivative portfolio of the Bank is positioned to decrease the overall market risk resulting from the combination of assets and liabilities. The Banks market risk is discussed and quantified in more detail in the Gap Analysis and Scenario Analysis sections below. Most of the Banks assets are generally classified as non trading portfolios and, as such, are not marked to market through earnings for accounting purposes. The Bank did maintain a trading portfolio of investment grade securities throughout 2001. The market value of the trading portfolio at December 31, 2001 was $70.9 million. There were no holdings in the trading account as of September 30, 2000. The trading portfolio at December 31, 2001 was predominantly investment grade collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage backed securities. Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis is a more advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the Net Present Value of Equity (NPVE) approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitment are estimated and then combined to produce a Net Present Value of Equity figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up and down of 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The sensitivity of NPVE as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the limits established by the Board of Directors are listed below: Parallel Changein Interest Rates (bps) Change in NPVEAs of December 31, 2001 Change in NPVEAs of December 31, 2000 Board Limit +300 13% 40% 55% +200 11% 18% 30% +100 6% 4% 15% Base Case 100 3% 19% 15% 200 7% 45% 30% +200 29% 68% 55% As of December 31, 2001 the Banks overall interest rate risk exposure would be classified as minimal under the criteria published by the Banks regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is best viewed in the context of the overall balance sheet, and the value of any single component of the balance sheet or off balance sheet positions should not be viewed in isolation. 88 Table of Contents Gap Analysis A simple tool used in interest rate risk measurement is a gap analysis. A gap analysis quantifies the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice in the same time period. This difference is referred to as the interest rate sensitivity gap. When the assets repricing within a time period exceed the liabilities repricing within the same period, an institution is said to be Positively Gapped and presumably its earnings will rise if interest rates rise and decline if interest rates fall. The cumulative gap to total assets quantifies the interest rate sensitivity gaps for periods in the future. The cumulative gap to total assets hedge affected also includes the impact of repricing of interest rate swaps, discussed more fully in the Derivative Financial Instrument section below. In either line item, a positive number indicates that maturing or repricing assets during the period. At December 31, 2001, the cumulative gap to total assets for repricing within 12 months was 35.1% compared to 49.1% at September 30, 2000. The decline was due primarily to deposit growth of transactional deposits (included in savings account in the table). For the hedge affected cumulative gap, the derivatives portfolio put the Banks gap for repricing within 12 months as more asset heavy at December 31, 2001. The shift in the Banks risk profile and the impact of its derivative positions is discussed more fully in the section entitled Scenario Analysis above. The following table sets forth our gap at December 31, 2001: Balance at December 31, 2001 Percent of Total Repricing Within 0 3 Months Repricing Within 4 12 Months Repricing Within 1 5 Years Repricing in More Than 5 Years (dollars in thousands) Interest earning banking assets: Loans receivable $ 8,010,457 61.80 % $ 794,231 $ 1,279,743 $ 3,501,757 $ 2,434,726 Mortgage backed securities, available for sale and trading 3,627,470 27.98 % 273,579 287,366 857,804 2,208,721 Investment securities, available for sale and FHLB stock 1,035,660 7.99 % 306,672 122,792 378,881 227,315 Federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits 288,674 2.23 % 288,674 Total interest earning banking assets 12,962,261 100.00 % $ 1,663,156 $ 1,689,901 $ 4,738,442 $ 4,870,762 Non interest earning banking assets 499,963 Total banking assets $ 13,462,224 Interest bearing banking liabilities: Savings deposits $ 2,857,048 23.32 % $ $ $ 2,857,048 $ Time deposits 5,225,811 42.65 % 1,261,157 2,745,118 1,218,538 998 FHLB advances 906,300 7.39 % 806,300 50,000 50,000 Other borrowings 3,264,195 26.64 % 3,264,195 Total interest bearing banking liabilities 12,253,354 100.00 % $ 5,331,652 $ 2,745,118 $ 4,125,586 $ 50,998 Non interest bearing banking liabilities 420,612 Total banking liabilities 12,673,966 Minority interest in subsidiary 69,503 Stockholders equity 718,755 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 13,462,224 Periodic gap $ (3,668,496 ) $ (1,055,217 ) $ 612,856 $ 4,819,764 Cumulative gap $ (3,668,496 ) $ (4,723,713 ) $ (4,110,857 ) $ 708,907 Cumulative gap to total assets (27.3 )% (35.1 )% (30.5 )% 5.3 % Cumulative gap to total assets hedge affected 11.6 % 12.0 % (26.9 )% 5.3 % As of September 30, 2000: Cumulative gap to total assets (36.9 )% (49.1 )% (24.0 )% 6.5 % Cumulative gap to total assets hedge affected 1.1 % (12.8 )% (21.5 )% 6.5 % 89 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments The Bank employs derivative financial instruments to help manage the Banks interest rate risk exposure to acceptable levels. Interest rate swaps are used to lower the duration of specific fixed rate assets or increase the duration of specific adjustable rate liabilities. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the effects on market values resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the Banks mortgage portfolios. The types of options the Bank employs are primarily caps and floors. Cap options (caps) benefit from increases in market interest rates while floor options (floors) benefit from decreases in market interest rates. The total notional amount of derivative financial instruments relative to total assets is largely the result of the Banks exposure to mortgage securities and loans which involve both sensitivity to interest rates and sensitivity to the rates at which the borrowers exercise their option to prepay their loans as interest rates decline. Consequently, a mortgage instrument is hedged with a combination of interest rate swaps, cap and floor options. At December 31, 2001, the Bank had derivatives with $11.5 billion in total notional outstanding in comparison to $8.4 billion at September 30, 2000. Interest rate swaps at December 31, 2001, were $6.3 billion in notional with an unrealized loss of $246.2 million. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by the net decrease of interest rates in 2001. The Bank primarily uses payer positions in which the Bank pays a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount and receives a floating rate in exchange. The terms and conditions of the swaps are intended to be industry standard to maintain the liquidity of the instruments. At December 31, 2001, the notional amounts of options were $4.5 billion in caps and $0.7 billion in floors. At September 30, 2000, the Bank had $5.3 billion in interest rate swap notional with an unrealized loss of $38.5 million. At September 30, 2000, the notional amounts of options were $3.1 billion in caps and $25.0 million in floors. The increase of notional amounts outstanding in the Banks derivatives portfolio was in line with the aggregate 50% increase in the Banks total assets from September 30, 2000 to December 31, 2001. The derivatives portfolio grew by 36%. In the +200 basis points change scenario, the risk profile of assets decreased as the Bank diversified its assets into automobile loan product. Automobile loans have less sensitivity to interest rates and refinancing than mortgage product. This diversification mitigated the need for the derivative portfolio to increase proportionately with the increase in assets. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, (SFAS 133), on October 1, 2000. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on SFAS 133. Mortgage Production Activities In the production of mortgage product, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk between the commitment dates of the loans and their funding dates. At December 31, 2001, there were $1.5 billion in mortgage loan commitments await funding. At September 30, 2000, there were $0.5 billion in similar commitments. 90 Table of Contents
