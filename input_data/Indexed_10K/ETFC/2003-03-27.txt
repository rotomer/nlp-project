On January 22, 2001, our fiscal year end was changed from September 30 to December 31. Fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 represent the twelve months ended December 31. Fiscal 2000 represents the twelve months ended September 30. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because we operate in the financial services industry, we follow certain accounting guidance used by the brokerage and banking industries. One of the more significant impacts of these rules is that interest income and expense from our lending and banking activities, as well as gains and losses from sales of loans and banking investments, are included in net revenues, whereas corporate interest income and expense, as well as gains and losses on corporate investments are reported as non operating income and expense. Our consolidated balance sheet is not separated into current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. Certain financial assets, such as mortgage backed and investment securities are carried at fair market value in our consolidated balance sheet while other assets, such as loans receivable, are carried at historic values. Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments which can materially impact reported results: Determination of the allowance for loan losses (see also Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements); Classification and valuation of certain investments (see also Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements); Valuation and accounting for financial derivatives (see also Note 28 to Consolidated Financial Statements); Estimate of accrued restructuring costs (see also Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements); and Valuation of goodwill (see also Note 23 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Determination of the allowance for loan losses Through the Bank, we originate and purchase mortgage and consumer loans that we intend to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay off. We may not be able to collect all principal and interest due on these loans. Allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We perform regular reviews in order to identify inherent losses and to assess the overall credit risk of our portfolio. The determination of the allowance for loan losses involves the monitoring of delinquency, default and historical loss experience. We make estimates and assumptions regarding existing but yet unidentified losses caused by current economic conditions. If we do not adequately reserve for these uncollectible loans, we may incur additional charges to loan losses in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our allowance for loan losses, we have established both specific and general allowances. The amount of the specific allowance is determined through a loan by loan analysis of certain large dollar real estate and consumer loans. Loans not individually reviewed are evaluated as a group using expected loss ratios, which are based on our historical charge off experience, industry loss experience and current market and economic conditions. At December 31, 2002, our loan loss allowance was $27.7 million on $5,580.6 million of loans we intend to hold for investment. In determining the appropriate level of the general allowance and projecting losses 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we make estimates based on various factors including borrower credit scores, debt to income ratios, loan to value ratios, geographic concentrations and the cost and timing of collateral repossession and disposal. Estimates are periodically measured against actual loss experience and industry loss data. Adjustments are made to future projections as assumptions are revised. The determination of the allowance for loan losses requires management to make significant estimates with respect to the amounts and timing of losses and market and economic conditions. Accordingly, a continued decline in the national economy or the local economies of the areas in which the Banks loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge off amounts and the need for additional loan loss allowances in future periods. The Banks investment in consumer loans continues to increase with the addition of retail consumer loan origination platforms that were established or acquired during fiscal 2002. These loans provide higher yields than single family mortgage loans but typically experience higher charge off rates. The impact of adverse economic trends or events is generally more significant in consumer loan portfolios. In addition, the regulatory agencies that supervise the Bank periodically review the Banks allowance for loan losses. These reviews may also result in additions or deductions to the allowance for loan losses. In addition to our banking loans described above, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin loans. At December 31, 2002, margin accounts had approximately $980 million in outstanding margin loans. We provided an allowance for uncollectible margin loans of $3.1 million based on historical experience as well as the review of certain individual customer accounts and the specific identification of uncollectible amounts. Classification and valuation of certain investments We generally classify our investment in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. Classification of an investment determines how it is accounted for. Investment classifications are subject to on going review and change. When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing losses based on market conditions and other factors. If our estimates change, we may recognize additional losses. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities, which are held by our Bank, are recognized in gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net. Our brokerage operations hold trading securities for market making purposes and record the net gains as principal transactions revenues. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value which we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net for our banking investments and gain (loss) on investments for our non banking investments. At December 31, 2002, our investments in debt and mortgage backed securities had unrealized losses of $76.6 million, which we believe to be temporary based in part on our intent to hold these securities for the foreseeable future. Consequently, we have not included these unrealized losses in the computation of our earnings. We have investments in interest only securities which totaled $11.9 million at December 31, 2002. Impairment of interest only securities is recognized when the securitys fair value is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows have decreased since the last periodic estimate. For fiscal 2002, we recorded impairment losses of $16.6 million related to these interest only securities. We also recognized a $16.3 million loss on sale of interest only securities during fiscal 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we held, as part of our investment portfolio, $5.8 million of asset backed securities issued by Metris Master Trust 2000 1 and $29.2 million issued by Conseco Financial Securitizations 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Corporation. These securities are backed by loans and receivables from multiple underlying obligors and are not direct obligations of Metris Companies or Conseco Incorporated. As of December 31, 2002, the market values of these securities were $4.7 million and $21.3 million, respectively. We performed a detailed credit and cash flow analysis of the underlying assets in each of these securities and do not believe this decline in market value represents an other than temporary impairment. We intend to hold these securities for the foreseeable future and continue to monitor any developments related to the cash flows associated with these securities. We have investments in several publicly traded and privately held companies. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we evaluate our investments in these companies for declines in market value which we believe are other than temporary. Our policy is to recognize such declines when the market value of a companys stock remains below our cost for a period of six months, unless recognized sooner based on other indicators. During fiscal 2002, we recognized losses of $12.5 million from declines in market value which we determined to be other than temporary related to investments in privately held companies. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2002, certain of the publicly traded equity securities which we held had unrecognized losses of $0.7 million, which we believe to be temporary and consequently, we have not included these losses in the computation of our earnings. We have made significant investments in venture capital funds, which invest in privately held companies. Generally accepted accounting principles require venture capital funds to adjust their investments in publicly traded and privately held companies to reflect current market values each period. Because we account for our investments in these funds under the equity method, our earnings are impacted by the portion of market value changes allocated to us. The determination of market value for privately held companies requires significant judgment on the part of the fund managers. The general practice in the venture capital industry is to record an increase in fair value only when it is supported by a third party transaction, such as a sale of stock to an unrelated investor. Decreases in fair value are generally recognized upon a similar event, or sooner if general market conditions or company specific events indicate there has been a decline in value. During fiscal 2002, we recorded losses of $9.7 million on our venture fund investments. Valuation and accounting for financial derivatives The Company enters into derivative transactions to protect against the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets and future cash flows. One of the most significant risks arises because the principal investments of the Bank are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which often pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time; however, the principal source of funds used to make these investments are customer deposits and other short term borrowings whose interest rates are fixed for a much shorter period of time, if at all. In order to manage this difference in short term and long term interest rates, the Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors. Under generally accepted accounting principles, all derivatives must be reflected in the balance sheet at their estimated fair market value. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether or not a derivative is designated as a hedge. In order to qualify as a hedge, management must designate a derivative as a hedge or a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased, as well as continue to demonstrate that the instrument effectively hedges or reduces a risk associated with that item. We designated substantially all of our derivatives held as of December 31, 2002 as hedges. By doing so, the balance sheet items that we determine are hedged in fair value hedge relationships are adjusted to market value as well as the derivative itself, resulting in a net offset in the statements of operations to the extent that the hedge is effective. The effective portion of the gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognized initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a yield adjustment as the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings. The assessment as to whether a derivative instrument will continue to meet the effectiveness requirements of generally accepted accounting principles requires assumptions and judgment about the continued effectiveness of 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. We base our assumptions and judgments on the best information available to us at the time of the preparation of our financial statements. If our hedging strategies were to become ineffective or if our assumptions as to the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate we would no longer be able to apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. More information concerning our derivatives is contained in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in Note 28 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimate of accrued restructuring costs On August 29, 2001, we announced a restructuring plan aimed at streamlining operations and enhancing profitability by consolidating facilities in the United States and Europe. The restructuring resulted in a pre tax charge of $202.8 million in fiscal 2001, with additional charges of $11.4 million expensed in fiscal 2002. Total non cash charges through fiscal 2002, principally the write off of assets, total approximately $100.0 million, while the remainder represents cash obligations. As of December 31, 2002, our estimated remaining future cash obligations related to the consolidation of our facilities are $69.1 million. This includes rental payments due for certain facilities no longer to be used by the Company totaling $97.5 million, offset by our best estimate of the future sublease income we expect to receive of $28.3 million. In calculating our initial restructuring accrual and the subsequent adjustments made through December 31, 2002, certain estimates were made including time to vacate facilities, potential future sublease terms, broker commissions and operating costs. In developing our estimates we obtained information from leasing agents to calculate anticipated sublease income. Fluctuating market conditions will continue to affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Of the total $11.4 million fiscal 2002 increase in the 2001 original restructuring charges, $7.3 million was related to facility consolidation. This increase relates to changes in managements estimates based on current economic conditions. The overall net increase in the restructuring reserve reflects lower than estimated sublease rental income combined with longer than estimated periods to sublet vacated facilities. The increase also reflects the Companys negotiations in fiscal 2002 with a lessor on a contractual lease obligation that may require a possible one time $30.0 million payment by the Company in fiscal 2003 to facilitate the lessors sale of the property. In exchange, the Company expects to receive full release from its future lease obligations. The net increase in the facility consolidation reserve is partially offset by the decision to retain usage of certain facilities, resulting in the elimination of the reserve originally estimated for these facilities. Valuation of goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired from acquisitions. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. Adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets are made whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. Based on our evaluation of goodwill under the SFAS No. 142s transitional impairment test, we recorded an impairment charge of $293.7 million in fiscal 2002, primarily attributed to the goodwill from our international acquisitions. This loss was recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The evaluation was based on our forecast of operating results for each of the reporting units, as well as estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets of these units. In November 2002, the Company performed, with the assistance of an independent third party other than its Independent Auditors, its annual impairment test of goodwill. The test indicated that no additional impairment charge was necessary. The Companys recorded goodwill at December 31, 2002 is $385.1 million, which will continue to be evaluated for impairment at least annually. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Key Performance Indicators The following tables set forth several key indicators used by management to measure our performance during the three years ended December 31, 2002, December 31, 2001 and September 30, 2000 (dollars in thousands, except cost per net new account, average assets per household and average commission per brokerage transactions): December 31, September 30, 2000 Percentage Change 2002 versus 2001 2001 versus2000 2002 2001 Active brokerage accounts (1)(2) 3,690,916 3,511,941 3,027,362 5 % 16 % Active banking accounts (3) 511,298 490,913 288,073 4 % 70 % Total active accounts 4,202,214 4,002,854 3,315,435 5 % 21 % Assets in brokerage accounts (2) $ 35,116,929 $ 44,764,197 $ 61,249,949 (22)% (27) % Deposits in banking accounts 8,400,333 8,082,859 4,630,068 4 % 75 % Total assets/deposits in customer accounts $ 43,517,262 $ 52,847,056 $ 65,880,017 (18)% (20)% Total customer households 3,132,024 3,005,021 Not Available 4 % Not Available Average assets per household $ 13,894 $ 17,586 Not Available (21)% Not Available Net new global brokerage accounts (1)(2) 178,975 315,549 1,459,969 (43)% (78)% Net new banking accounts (3) 20,385 128,296 190,671 (84)% (33)% Total new accounts 199,360 443,845 1,650,640 (55)% (73)% Cost per new account $ 365 $ 281 $ 263 30 % 7 % Total brokerage transactions (2)(4)(5) 22,152,137 28,231,162 42,560,692 (22)% (34)% Daily average brokerage transactions (2)(4)(5) 87,905 113,835 168,224 (23)% (32)% Average commission per brokeragetransactions (2)(5) $ 12.78 $ 13.38 $ 15.88 (4)% (16)% (1) Brokerage accounts are considered active if the account has a positive asset balance, or if a trade has been made in the account in the past six months or if the account was opened in connection with a corporate employee stock benefit program.

Net brokerage revenues decreased 5% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 26% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The decrease in net brokerage revenues was mainly due to decreases in commission revenues and net interest income, offset by increases in principal transactions reflecting our acquisition of Dempsey in October 2001 as well as the decrease in interest expenses. Net banking revenues increased 26% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. This increase is due to a widening of the net interest spread at the Bank from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002, the continued decline in interest rates throughout fiscal 2002 to 40 year lows that favorably impacted our mortgage origination business, which we acquired in fiscal 2001, and our correspondent business. This resulted in an increase in gain on sales of originated loans and an increase in gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net, offset by impairments and losses on sale of securities. Brokerage Revenues Commissions, which are earned as retail customers execute securities transactions, decreased 20% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 44% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. These revenues are primarily affected by brokerage transaction volume, average commission per brokerage transactions, transaction mix and our professional trading business. Total retail brokerage transactions, excluding professional trading, decreased 22% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 34% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001, largely reflective of continuing global market declines. Average commission per brokerage transactions, excluding professional trading, decreased 4% from $13.38 for fiscal 2001 to $12.78 for fiscal 2002 and decreased 16% from $15.88 for fiscal 2000 to $13.38 for fiscal 2001. The decreases in average commission per brokerage transactions can be attributed to transaction mix and the 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements implementation of a simplified $9.99 flat commission rate program for the active trader segment in June 2002. This new program, combined with an increase in the transactions generated by this customer segment for fiscal 2002 compared to the same period in 2001, accounts for a majority of the decrease in average commission per brokerage transactions over the same period. The decrease in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 was also impacted by transaction mix, with option transactions, which have higher commissions than equity transactions, representing a smaller percentage of total transactions in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000. Commissions from professional traders are based on share volumes as compared to transactions. The decrease in brokerage transactions during fiscal 2002 was partially offset by commission revenues from professional trading as a result of the acquisition of E*TRADE Professional Trading in June 2002. Principal transactions, which comprise institutional and market making revenues, increased 37% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2001 and 7% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. These increases are primarily due to the impact of a full year in fiscal 2002 of market making revenues following our October 2001 acquisition of Dempsey. Other brokerage related is comprised of account maintenance fees, implemented in December 2001, mutual fund management fees, payments for order flow from outside market makers, BSG revenue, professional trading rebate revenues, fees for brokerage related services and ECN fees. Other brokerage related revenues increased 14% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and decreased 4% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The increase from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to an increase in account maintenance fees, mutual fund revenues, revenues associated with the internalization of the money market funds that are offered to brokerage customers beginning in October 2002 and professional trading rebate revenues from our acquisition of E*TRADE Professional Trading in June 2002, offset by a reduction in payment for order flow revenue. The increase also includes a $6 million gain on the fiscal 2002 sale of the Companys shares in the Toronto Stock Exchange. The decrease from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 is primarily due to a decrease in payment for order flow revenue partially offset by an increase in other brokerage related fees. The decrease in payment for order flow revenue is primarily due to competitive forces and the advent of decimalization in the major market exchanges beginning in January 2001 and implemented by Nasdaq in March 2001. Further, following our acquisition of Dempsey in October 2001, customer orders executed through Dempsey no longer give rise to order flow revenues but instead result in market making revenues included in principal transactions. Interest income from brokerage related activities is primarily comprised of interest earned by our brokerage subsidiaries on credit extended to customers to finance purchases of securities on margin, interest earned on cash and investments required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations and fees on customer assets invested in money market accounts. Brokerage interest income decreased 40% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 34% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The decrease in brokerage interest income primarily reflects the decrease in average customer margin balances, which decreased 40% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 53% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The sluggish economy and continued market decline over the past year, which has decreased the value of net assets held by investors, has reduced borrowing on margin by customers. Interest expense from brokerage related activities is primarily comprised of interest paid to customers on certain credit balances, interest paid to banks and interest paid to other broker dealers through a brokerage subsidiarys stock loan program. Brokerage interest expense decreased 86% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 61% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The decrease in brokerage interest expense primarily reflects an overall decrease in interest rates and reduced margin borrowings. Banking Revenues Gain on sales of originated loans is comprised of gains on loans originated by E*TRADE Mortgage, which we acquired in February 2001. Gain on sales of originated loans increased 35% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to an increased level of volume of direct to customer originations driven by higher refinance and home purchase volumes as mortgage interest rates decreased to record lows throughout fiscal 2002. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net consists primarily of gain on sales of available for sale mortgage backed securities, loans held for sale, trading activity, impairment of Bank securities and gains and losses related to market value adjustments and sales of derivative financial instruments not in effective SFAS No. 133 hedging relationships. Gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net increased 11% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 793% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. These increases were primarily related to gain on sales of loans held for sale and mortgage backed securities which increased $32.4 million from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and $69.6 million from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. Offsetting these increases were recognized losses and impairment charges associated with our interest only securities of $32.9 million in fiscal 2002 and $13.5 million in fiscal 2001 related to an investment security. Losses on derivative financial instrument sales decreased to $3.7 million for fiscal 2002, from $4.3 million for fiscal 2001. For fiscal 2000, losses on derivative financial instruments were $0.8 million. Other banking related is comprised primarily of ATM transaction fees and other fees imposed on deposit accounts. Other banking related revenues increased 20% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 120% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. These increases are due to higher ATM transaction surcharge volume, and the increase in fiscal 2001 also reflects the acquisition of E*TRADE Access in May 2000. Interest income from banking related activities reflects interest earned on assets, consisting primarily of loans receivable and mortgage backed securities. Banking interest income decreased 11% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and increased 72% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. Fluctuation in banking interest income represents changes in average yield based on the decline in market interest rates, partially offset by increases in average interest earning banking asset balances and increases in higher yielding interest earning assets such as the increase in the automobile loan portfolio. Average interest earning banking assets increased 11% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 92% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The average yield on interest earning banking assets decreased to 5.58% for fiscal 2002 from 6.93% for fiscal 2001, which decreased from 7.73% in fiscal 2000. Interest expense from banking related activities is incurred through interest bearing banking liabilities that include customer deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and other borrowings. Banking interest expense decreased 21% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and increased 83% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. Fluctuations in banking interest expense reflect changes in the average cost of borrowings and changes in the average interest bearing banking liability balances. Average interest bearing banking liability balances increased 14% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 93% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. Offsetting the effect of increasing interest bearing banking liability balances in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, the average cost of borrowings decreased to 4.14% in fiscal 2002 from 5.97% in fiscal 2001 which decreased from 6.29% in fiscal 2000. Net interest spread increased from 0.96% for fiscal 2001 to 1.44% for fiscal 2002. This increase is the result of several initiatives put in place to improve overall spreads, such as the Banks asset diversification strategy and the Banks lower cost of funding caused by a shift in the structure of our deposit base from time deposits to transactional accounts that carry a lower cost of funds than certificates of deposits. In addition, decreases in wholesale funding rates also contributed to the decrease in the Banks overall funding costs. Net interest spread decreased from 1.44% for fiscal 2000 to 0.96% for fiscal 2001. The decrease is the result of decreased yields on assets partially due to pre payments of higher yielding mortgages and purchases of lower yielding securities, the effects from which were not fully offset by the impact of decreasing interest rates on our wholesale borrowings and consumer deposits. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table presents average balance data and income and expense data for our banking operations and the related interest yields and rates for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. The table also presents information with respect to net interest margin, an indicator of profitability. Another indicator of profitability is net interest spread, which is the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning banking assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing banking liabilities.

For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to volume (change in average outstanding balance multiplied by the prior years rate) and rate (change in average interest rate multiplied by the prior years volume). Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately (in thousands): Fiscal 2002 Versus Fiscal 2001 Increase (Decrease) Due To Fiscal 2001 Versus Fiscal 2000 Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest earning banking assets: Loans receivable, net $ 56,265 $ (73,109 ) $ (16,844 ) $ 261,427 $ (21,789 ) $ 239,638 Interest bearing deposits 1,368 (589 ) 779 3,137 (2,340 ) 797 Mortgage backed and related available for sale securities 33,662 (80,340 ) (46,678 ) 86,580 (31,942 ) 54,638 Available for sale investment securities (25,702 ) (4,916 ) (30,618 ) 62,244 (1,253 ) 60,991 Investment in FHLB stock 583 (503 ) 80 258 (881 ) (623 ) Trading securities 4,869 (1,722 ) 3,147 2,954 (873 ) 2,081 Total interest earning banking assets(1) 71,045 (161,179 ) (90,134 ) 416,600 (59,078 ) 357,522 Interest bearing banking liabilities: Retail deposits 552 (85,886 ) (85,334 ) 222,382 934 223,316 Brokered certificates of deposit 5,590 (1,425 ) 4,165 (3,653 ) (362 ) (4,015 ) FHLB advances (13,943 ) (7,544 ) (21,487 ) (131 ) 399 268 Other borrowings 34,327 (75,798 ) (41,471 ) 103,498 (8,591 ) 94,907 Total interest bearing banking liabilities 26,526 (170,653 ) (144,127 ) 322,096 (7,620 ) 314,476 Change in net interest income $ 44,519 $ 9,474 $ 53,993 $ 94,504 $ (51,458 ) $ 43,046 (1) Amount includes a taxable equivalent increase in interest income of $0.3 million in fiscal 2002 and none in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses Allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We perform regular reviews in order to identify these inherent losses and to assess the overall credit risk of our portfolio. The determination of the allowance for loan losses involves the monitoring of delinquency, default and historical loss experience. We make estimates and assumptions regarding existing but yet unidentified losses caused by current economic conditions. As a part of our quarterly assessment for the three months ended September 30, 2002, the allowance for loan losses for consumer loans was increased to provide for a minimum twelve months of expected losses compared to six months. This change was made due to increased uncertainty in current economic conditions and due to continued diversification of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2002, the total loan loss allowance was $27.7 million or 104% of total non performing loans of $26.5 million. As of December 31, 2001, the total loan loss allowance was $19.9 million or 96.1% of total non performing loans of $20.7 million. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Activity in the allowance for loan losses is summarized as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Three Months Ended December 31, 2000  Year Ended September 30, 2000  2002 2001 Allowance for loan losses, beginning of period $ 19,874 $ 12,565 $ 10,930 $ 7,161 Provision for loan losses 14,664 7,476 1,647 4,003 Acquired through acquisitions 14,428 4,699 Charge offs, net (21,300 ) (4,866 ) (12 ) (234 ) Allowance for loan losses, end of period $ 27,666 $ 19,874 $ 12,565 $ 10,930 The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by major loan category. This allocation does not necessarily restrict the use of the allowance from absorbing losses in other categories (dollars in thousands): Consumer(1) Real Estate and Home Equity(2) Total Allowance Allowanceas % ofconsumer loans held for investment Allowance Allowanceas % ofreal estate loans held for investment Allowance Allowanceas % oftotal loans held for investment December 31, 2002 $ 23,472 0.68 % $ 4,194 0.21 % $ 27,666 0.50 % December 31, 2001 $ 11,001 0.66 % $ 8,873 0.19 % $ 19,874 0.31 % (1) Primarily includes automobiles, RVs and marine loans. (2) Primarily includes one to four family mortgage and home equity loans. Provision for loan losses was $14.7 million for fiscal 2002, $7.5 million for fiscal 2001 and $4.0 million for fiscal 2000. Charge offs Loans are charged off when, in the estimation of management, principal and interest due on an impaired loan will not be fully collected. Net charge offs increased from $4.9 million to $21.3 million from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002, and from $0.2 million to $4.9 million from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The increase in net charge offs primarily relates to the seasoning of the consumer loan portfolio, as well as an increase in the consumer loan balance. Net charge offs were also higher during fiscal 2002 due to losses related to purchased consumer loans. These losses were charged against a related $4.7 million component of the allowance acquired with the purchase of certain delinquent consumer loans in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The Banks portfolio of held for investment loans decreased to $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002 from $6.4 billion at December 31, 2001, principally due to a reclassification of $2.6 billion in loans from held for investment to held for sale in anticipation of the future sale of these loans, consistent with our plans to achieve a more diversified loan portfolio through the future purchase and acquisition of consumer loans including the $1.9 billion of consumer loans acquired with the December 2002 acquisition of Ganis Credit Corporation. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cost of Services and Operating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of cost of services and operating expenses and percentage change information for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31,  Year Ended September 30, 2000 2002 Versus 2001 2001 Versus 2000 2002 2001 Cost of services $ 567,224 $ 595,590 $ 515,571 (5)% 16 % Cost of services as a percentage of net revenues 43 % 47 % 38 % Operating expenses: Selling and marketing 203,613 253,422 521,532 (20)% (51)% Technology development 55,712 88,717 142,914 (37)% (38)% General and administrative 210,646 236,353 209,436 (11)% 13 % Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 28,258 43,091 22,764 (34)% 89 Acquisition related expenses 11,473 11,174 36,427 3 % (69)% Facility restructuring and other exit charges 16,519 202,765 (92)% Executive agreement and loan settlement (23,485 ) 30,210 (178)% Total operating expenses $ 502,736 $ 865,732 $ 933,073 (42)% (7)% Cost of Services Cost of services includes compensation, benefits, facilities and other costs related to our customer service, system maintenance and technology operation. Cost of services decreased 5% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and increased 16% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The decrease in cost of services for fiscal 2002 was driven by the realization of a full year benefit of our restructuring efforts, including the consolidation of facilities, the rearchitecture of system and networks and the consolidation of certain international operations, as well as improved call center productivity and other operating efficiency gains. This improvement was offset by the impact of added costs associated with significant growth at E*TRADE Mortgage, a full year of expenses for Dempsey and a partial year impact for E*TRADE Professional Trading. The increases in cost of services in fiscal 2001 reflects a full year of additional expenses for the acquisition of E*TRADE Access and a partial year for the acquisitions of E*TRADE Mortgage, Web Street, Inc. (Web Street) and Dempsey, as well as the impact of amortizing internally developed software as a significant number of large projects completed in November 2000. Also impacting cost of services is increased activity in our Banking segment where active customer accounts increased 70% from September 30, 2000 to December 31, 2001. Growth in our banking and international subsidiaries combined with investment in our Wealth Management business segment resulted in an increase in cost of services in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. Looking forward, we expect cost of services to remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue until market conditions become more favorable and lead to increased customer activity, at which point we hope to experience further improvement in cost of services as a percentage of revenue. Operating Expenses Selling and marketing reflects expenditures for advertising placements, creative development and collateral materials resulting from a variety of advertising campaigns directed at expanding brand and product identity, costs for E*TRADE Centers and Zones, growing the customer base and increasing market share. Selling and marketing expenditures also include selling efforts in support of our Global and Institutional business segment. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 20% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 51% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. Decreases in selling and marketing from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 are primarily due to the implementation of a strategy that focuses on higher value customers. This strategy allowed a reduction in advertising, online, direct mailing and promotion activities. Decreases in selling and marketing expenditures 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 are primarily due to reductions in customer acquisition spending, including advertising, online and direct mailing and promotional activities. We believe marketing dollars are being spent more efficiently as we cross sell banking services to our brokerage customers in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. We believe selling and marketing will increase in fiscal 2003 as we try to increase product awareness. Technology development costs reflect design and development expensed during the period. Costs to internally develop software intended to add substantial new functionality are capitalized. Once the project is completed, these capitalized costs are amortized to cost of services. Such capitalized costs were $34.0 million in fiscal 2002, $27.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $61.5 million in fiscal 2000. Non capitalized technology development expenses decreased 37% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and decreased 38% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2001, we reviewed our technology development activities in conjunction with our restructuring plans and business initiatives. As a result, work on less critical projects ceased during the second half of fiscal 2001 and the use of outside contractors was reduced. The decrease in technology development in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 reflects our focused investment on core projects, reduction in use of contractors and realized savings from our restructuring plans initiated in 2001. With managements continuing focus on cost efficiencies, no significant increases in technology development spending are planned in fiscal 2003. Management believes that the level of current technology development spending is appropriate to support pending initiatives. General and administrative consists principally of compensation, benefit and facilities related costs for executive and administrative personnel, professional services and other corporate activities. General and administrative expenses decreased 11% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and increased 13% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The reduction in our general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 was primarily attributable to our restructuring initiated in August 2001 and the completion of ongoing negotiations and execution of a new employment agreement with our Former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (Former CEO) resulting in lower compensation and benefit expenses. The revised agreement was effective from May 2002 through his subsequent departure from the Company on January 23, 2003. Contributing to the decrease was a $9.6 million compensation charge related to vested funds contributed to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) in fiscal 2001. Offsetting these decreases, pursuant to the new employment agreement, the Company met its performance objectives and a bonus of $4.0 million was accrued in fiscal 2002 and paid in January 2003. Increases in costs associated with our fiscal 2001 acquisitions of Web Street and Dempsey and our acquisition of E*TRADE Professional Trading in June 2002 further offset the reduction in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002. In addition, the general and administrative expenses of E*TRADE Mortgage, which we acquired in February 2001, were not fully reflected in fiscal 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 of $26.9 million or 13% is primarily due to the growth of our Banking segment. Contributing to the increase in fiscal 2001 was the establishment and funding of the SERP program in January 2001. Discretionary contributions to the SERP increased general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 relating to both initial funding of the program and the expense accrued during fiscal 2001 for a portion of the January 2002 discretionary contribution. The Companys board of directors did not authorize any contributions to the SERP for fiscal 2003. Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was $28.3 million in fiscal 2002, $43.1 million in fiscal 2001 and $22.8 million in fiscal 2000. The overall decrease in the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in fiscal 2002, primarily relates to our adoption of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on January 1, 2002, after which we no longer amortize goodwill. We recorded no goodwill amortization in fiscal 2002. The amortization expense for fiscal 2002 relates to our other intangible assets from acquisitions including E*TRADE Access, which was acquired during fiscal 2000, the acquisitions of Web Street, E*TRADE Mortgage, 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Dempsey and certain deposit accounts from Advanta National Bank, a subsidiary of Advanta Corporation, in fiscal 2001, the acquisition of certain customer deposit accounts from Chase Manhattan Bank USA, National Association in February 2002, the acquisition of E*TRADE Professional Trading in June 2002 and our December 2002 acquisitions of Engelman and Ganis. The significant increase in the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in fiscal 2001 is primarily related to the acquisitions of E*TRADE Access in May 2000, E*TRADE Germany in October 2000, E*TRADE Mortgage in February 2001, Web Street in June 2001 and several of our international affiliates. Because of the increase in recorded intangibles which occurred during 2002, we expect amortization expense to increase to reflect a full year of amortization in fiscal 2003. Acquisition related expenses were $11.5 million in fiscal 2002, $11.2 million in fiscal 2001 and $36.4 million in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2002, acquisition related expenses included approximately $5.5 million related to non capitalizable costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of E*TRADE Professional Trading and $4.4 million related to payments under a management continuity agreement (Dempsey MCA) in connection with the acquisition of Dempsey in October 2001. In fiscal 2001, acquisition related expenses include approximately $5.8 million related to losses incurred by Web Street during the transition of Web Streets accounts to our systems. The transition of Web Streets accounts was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, at which time all of Web Streets domestic stand alone operations ceased. Also included in acquisition related expenses during fiscal 2001 was approximately $4.9 million paid under the Dempsey MCA. Acquisition related expenses in fiscal 2000 primarily related to transaction costs associated with the acquisition of ETFC and E*TRADE Technologies. Facility restructuring and other exit charges were $16.5 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $202.8 million in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 expense includes $12.2 million related to our strategic decision to sell our German operations and provide brokerage services to our German customers through the operations of our other European subsidiaries. As discussed below, we also increased our 2001 facility restructuring charges by $7.3 million and recognized $3.6 million in related severance expensed during fiscal 2002 and $0.5 million in additional asset write offs. Offsetting these charges in fiscal 2002 were gains associated with the sale and liquidation of two of our international subsidiaries in prior years and the final resolution in fiscal 2002 of related accrued obligations. In fiscal 2001, we announced a restructuring plan aimed at streamlining operations primarily by consolidating facilities in the United States and Europe. This restructuring resulted in a pre tax charge of $202.8 million ($148.0 million after tax) in fiscal 2001. The restructuring was designed to consolidate facilities to bring together key decision makers and streamline operations. We recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $131.8 million related to our facilities consolidation at September 30, 2001 (adjusted by $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and further adjusted by $7.3 million in fiscal 2002), representing the undiscounted value of ongoing lease commitments offset by anticipated third party subleases. The charge also includes a pre tax write off of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures totaling $38.6 million for fiscal 2001. As a result of our fiscal 2001 worldwide consolidation activities, certain software developed for specific locations and certain other fixed assets are no longer used. In total, we recorded a pre tax non cash charge of $52.5 million related to the write off of capitalized software and hardware related to certain technology projects and other fixed assets in fiscal 2001. In calculating the charge related to our asset write off, we calculated the amount of write offs as the net book value of assets less the amount of estimated proceeds upon disposition for certain saleable assets. The restructuring accrual also included other pre tax charges of $15.8 million for fiscal 2001 for committed expenses, termination of consulting agreements and cancellation penalties on various services for facilities we have vacated or expect to vacate. We recorded an increase to our initial restructuring charge of $5.9 million for severance payments made to employees identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and an additional amount 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of $3.6 million in fiscal 2002 as a part of our consolidation and integration efforts. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, severance is recorded in the period in which employees are identified and communication is made to these individuals. See Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Executive Agreement consists of nonrecurring savings from an amendment of the contract between the Company and our Former CEO. Effective January 23, 2003, our Former CEO resigned from the Company. A termination payment of $4.0 million required under his employment agreement, which is further discussed below, will be expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and paid in increments during fiscal 2003. Concurrent with his resignation in fiscal 2003, the Company reversed $3.7 million of compensation expense accrued in fiscal 2002 for the unvested portion of the Former CEOs restricted stock, held by a subsidiary trust of the Company. In May 2002, we executed a new employment agreement (the Employment Agreement) with our Former CEO, which included concessions resulting in a fiscal 2002 benefit to executive agreement and loan settlement. The Employment Agreement was effective May 2002 through his subsequent departure from the Company on January 23, 2003. The Employment Agreement included significant concessions by our Former CEO. Under this Employment Agreement, our Former CEOs base salary was reduced to zero. In addition, under the Employment Agreement, our Former CEO became contractually entitled to a bonus payment to be determined and paid based on the Companys meeting performance objectives. The Company met its fiscal 2002 performance objectives and a bonus of $4.0 million for the Former CEO was accrued in fiscal 2002 and paid in January 2003. Concessions reflected as a nonrecurring reduction to our operating expenses for fiscal 2002 included: Our Former CEO waived his right to receive vested benefits in our SERP program totaling $16.1 million that were previously deposited into a trust on his behalf on January 1, 2001 and 2002; these amounts had been previously recorded as part of general and administrative expense in fiscal 2001. Of this amount, $14.0 million was retained by the Company and recorded as a nonrecurring benefit in executive agreement and loan settlement, and $2.1 million was paid out as a one time bonus to eligible non executive employees of the Company. (The amounts distributed to non executive employees had no net effect on the results of operations.) Our Former CEO waived his right to have the Company reimburse him for taxes due on his restricted stock grants. The accrued liability for unpaid estimated taxes of $9.5 million for unvested shares as of March 31, 2002 was reversed and credited to executive agreement and loan settlement. The total benefit to the Company for amounts previously paid on our Former CEOs behalf or for amounts due to be paid in fiscal 2002 and waived under his revised employment agreement (net of the amounts distributed to the non executive employees of the Company which had no net effect on the results of operations) totaled $23.5 million and is reflected as a nonrecurring reduction in our operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Executive loan settlement relates to our Former CEOs original employment contract and other contractual negotiations undertaken by the Company in August 2001. As part of the original negotiated employment contract, we cancelled a $15.0 million note receivable and agreed to reimburse $15.2 million dollars in related taxes in return for the elimination of certain benefits contained in our Former CEOs employment agreement. The total of $30.2 million is reflected as executive loan settlement in the consolidated statement of operations. Other related party transactions are described in Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Non Operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of non operating income (expense) and percentage change information for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended September 30, 2000 Percentage Change 2002 Versus 2001 2001 Versus 2000 2002 2001 Corporate interest income $ 12,655 $ 22,179 $ 17,220 (43)% 29 % Corporate interest expense (47,740 ) (52,862 ) (29,535 ) (10)% 79 % Gain (loss) on investments (18,507 ) (49,812 ) 211,149 (63)% (124)% Equity in income (loss) of investments 9,071 (6,174 ) (11,513 ) 247 % (46)% Unrealized losses on venture funds (9,683 ) (34,716 ) (736 ) (72)% 4,617 % Fair value adjustments of financial derivatives (11,662 ) (3,112 ) (275)% Gain on early extinguishment of debt 5,346 49,318 (89)% Other (1,444 ) 200 (1,810 ) (822)% 111 % Total non operating income (expense) $ (61,964 ) $ (74,979 ) $ 184,775 (17)% (141)% Corporate interest income primarily relates to interest income earned on corporate investment balances and related party notes. Corporate interest income was $12.7 million in fiscal 2002, $22.2 million in fiscal 2001 and $17.2 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in corporate interest income from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to lower interest yields earned on these corporate investments. Further, decreased corporate interest income reflects a decrease in corporate cash balances and related party note balances. The increase in corporate interest income from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to an increase in our corporate investment activity during fiscal 2001, reflecting the initial use of proceeds from the issuance of $325 million of 6.75% convertible subordinated notes in May 2001 and interest income earned on related party notes. Corporate interest expense primarily reflects the interest expense resulting from the issuance of $325 million of 6.75% convertible subordinated notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 and interest paid on our $650 million 6% convertible notes issued during the second quarter of fiscal 2000. Corporate interest expense was $47.7 million in fiscal 2002, $52.9 million in fiscal 2001 and $29.5 million in fiscal 2000. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we retired 6% subordinated notes totaling $280 million through share and cash exchanges. The increase in corporate interest expense from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 primarily reflects the interest expense resulting from the issuance of $650 million in convertible subordinated notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2000. Gain (loss) on investments was a loss of $18.5 million for fiscal 2002, a loss of $49.8 million for fiscal 2001 and a gain of $211.1 million in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2002, loss on investments included impairment writedowns of privately held equity investments of $12.5 million for losses determined to be other than temporary. In fiscal 2001, loss on investments was primarily comprised of a $40.6 million impairment write down on publicly traded equity securities, proprietary mutual funds and equity method and other investments. In fiscal 2000, we liquidated portions of our investment portfolio, recognizing realized gains as a result of these sales. Included in realized gains on investments in fiscal 2000 is $77.5 million from the sale of a portion of our equity holdings in E*TRADE Japan K.K. following its initial public offering and realized gains of $132.3 million on the sale of other publicly traded equities. E*TRADE Japan K.K. is accounted for under the equity method. Equity income (loss) on investments was income of $9.1 million in fiscal 2002, loss of $6.2 million in fiscal 2001 and $11.5 million in fiscal 2000. Income in fiscal 2002 primarily reflected our investment in the KAP Group, LLC (KAP) offset by losses in our investment in E*TRADE Japan K.K., both accounted for under the equity method. In March 2003, SOFTBANK announced the proposed merger of E*TRADE Japan K.K. with Softbank Finance, a subsidiary of SOFTBANK. The merger has been approved by the Board of Directors of E*TRADE Japan K.K. and remains subject to the approval of the E*TRADE Japan K.K. shareholders. Upon the 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements closing of the merger, we will have a 19.9% investment in the newly merged entity. We do not expect to record a gain or loss upon the closing of the merger. Losses in fiscal 2001 reflected our investment in Wit Soundview Group, Inc. (Wit), accounted for under the equity method until it was disposed of on August 20, 2001, and our equity investment in eAdvisor, partially offset by income recorded primarily from our equity investment in E*TRADE Japan K.K. In fiscal 2000, losses resulted primarily from E*OFFERING in which our investment was sold in October 2000. See Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized losses on venture funds were $9.7 million in fiscal 2002, $34.7 million in fiscal 2001 and $0.7 million in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, we recorded unrealized losses on our participation in the Softbank Capital Partners, L.P. Fund, E*TRADE eCommerce Fund I (Fund I) and Arrow Path Fund II. These changes represent market fluctuations on public investments held by the funds and changes in the estimated value of their non public investments. Fund I was formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 and the Arrow Path Fund II was formed in the third quarter of fiscal 2000. In October 2001, we amended our agreement in Fund I to increase our capital commitment by $7.5 million and modify the order in which Fund I distributions are to occur. The change provides for cash contributing partners to receive priority in distribution until they reach a 15% annual rate of return on their initial investment. The securities contributing partners would then receive a 15% annual rate of return; additional distributions, if any, would be allocated proportionately to all limited partners. Most of our contribution to Fund I was made in the form of private securities and, with respect to this contribution, we will be entitled to distributions behind the cash contributing partners of Fund I, which include certain of our executive officers and directors. Due to this change in allocation method, we recorded an additional equity loss of $11.1 million. Fair value adjustments of financial derivatives were $11.7 million in fiscal 2002 and $3.1 million in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, the amounts primarily represent losses for the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives in effective hedging relationships. In fiscal 2001, the amount represents a $3.7 million loss on the valuation of warrants, partially offset by a $0.6 million gain representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives in effective hedging relationships. We owned warrants to purchase shares of common stock of Wit through August 20, 2001. The adjustment to the fair value of these warrants is reflected in the fair value adjustments of financial derivatives. We returned these warrants to Wit on August 20, 2001. Gain on early extinguishment of debt was $5.3 million in fiscal 2002, $49.3 million in fiscal 2001 and none in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2002, gain on early extinguishment of debt included a $8.6 million gain on the exchanges of $64.9 million of our 6% convertible subordinated notes for approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock, offset by a $3.3 million loss as a result of the early redemption of $100 million adjustable rate advances from the FHLB. In fiscal 2001, gain on early extinguishment of debt included a $59.9 million gain from retirement of $214.8 million of our 6% convertible subordinated notes in exchange for approximately 19.2 million shares of our common stock and $15.3 million paid in cash, offset by a $10.6 million loss recorded as a result of the early redemption of $827.0 million of adjustable and fixed rate advances from the FHLB. The FHLB advances were entered into as a result of normal funding requirements of our Banking operations. The loss consisted primarily of prepayment penalties and costs associated with these early redemptions. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 requires that any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt that were classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that are not unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence be reclassified. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we adopted the requirements of SFAS No. 145 in our consolidated financial statements, resulting in a reclassification of our extraordinary gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt to non operating income (expense). In September 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue 02 15, Determining Whether Certain Conversions of Convertible Debt to Equity Securities Are within the Scope of FASB Statement No. 84, Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt. The Task Force reached a consensus that SFAS No. 84 applies to all conversions that occur pursuant to revised conversion privileges that are exercisable 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements only for a limited period of time and result in the issuance of all of the equity securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the debt offering, regardless of the party that initiates the offer or whether the offer relates to all debt holders. The consensus should be applied prospectively to all applicable inducements that close after September 12, 2002. The Company has adopted EITF 02 15 effective September 12, 2002. Since September 12, 2002, no convertible debt was retired through a conversion to equity. Other expense was $1.4 million in fiscal 2002, other income of $0.2 million in fiscal 2001 and other expense of $1.8 million in fiscal 2000, which is primarily comprised of foreign exchange gains (losses), recorded as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet that are denominated in non functional currencies and also includes losses on fixed asset disposals. Income tax expense (benefit) represents the expense for federal and state income taxes at an effective tax rate of 43.9% for fiscal 2002, (7.6)% for fiscal 2001 and 81.8% for fiscal 2000. The rate for fiscal 2002 reflects a decrease in taxes from goodwill, losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and capital losses for which no benefit was recognized. The rate for fiscal 2001 reflects a decrease in the tax benefit for non deductible expenses such as certain compensation and the amortization of goodwill, differences between our statutory and foreign effective tax rates and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized. The rate for fiscal 2000 reflects an increase in tax expense from non deductible acquisition related expenses combined with the amortization of goodwill and differences between our statutory and foreign effective tax rate. Minority interest in subsidiaries was $1.6 million for fiscal 2002, $0.5 million for fiscal 2001 and $(0.2) million for fiscal 2000. Minority interest in subsidiaries results primarily from minority equity interest in various membership interests of E*TRADE Professional Trading LLC and ETFCs interest payments to subsidiary trusts which have issued Company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities and which hold junior subordinated debentures of ETFC. Also included in minority interest in subsidiaries is the net income or loss attributed to a minority interest in one of our international affiliates in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and two of our international affiliates in fiscal 2000. Cumulative effect of accounting change was $293.7 million in fiscal 2002, which was due to our adoption of SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, whereby we reviewed our goodwill for impairment using fair market value tests and as a result wrote down goodwill associated with certain of our international subsidiaries acquired in the previous years. As required under SFAS No. 142, we will continue to review, at least annually, the impairment (if any) of all of our goodwill positions and record future impairment charges to operating expenses. See Note 23 to Consolidated Financial Statements. The cumulative effect of accounting change of $83,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2000 resulted from our adoption of SFAS No. 133. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have historically met our liquidity needs primarily through investing and financing activities, consisting principally of equity and debt offerings, increases in core deposit accounts, other borrowings and sales of loans or securities. We believe that we will be able to renew or replace our funding sources at prevailing market rates, which may be higher or lower than current rates, as well as to supplement these funding sources with cash flow from operations. Equity Offerings and Retirements In fiscal 2002, we repurchased and retired 10.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $43.5 million. In addition, we retired an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock, valued at $28.8 million, in connection with the satisfaction of shareholders notes receivable. In fiscal 2001, we repurchased and retired approximately 37.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $239.1 million. Except for 7.0 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2001, these shares were repurchased under a multi year stock buyback program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2001 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements authorizing us to repurchase up to 50.0 million shares of common stock. Pursuant to the stock buyback program approved by the Board, the Company remains authorized to repurchase up to 4.3 million additional shares of common stock. Of the 52.7 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired, approximately 30.4 million shares were purchased in three private transactions with SOFTBANK Corporation (SOFTBANK), a significant shareholder of E*TRADE, for approximately $195.9 million. Of this total, 20.0 million shares were purchased at a price of $7.28 per share, which represented a discount from the market price on the day of sale. Debt Offerings and Retirements In fiscal 2000, we completed a private offering of an aggregate principal amount of $650 million of convertible subordinated notes due February 2007. The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a conversion price of $23.60 (15.7 million shares based on the $370.3 million principal amount of notes outstanding at December 31, 2002). The notes bear interest at 6%, payable semi annually, and are non callable for three years and may then be called by us at a premium, which declines over time. The holders have the right to require redemption at a premium in the event of a change in control or other defined redemption event. We used $145.0 million of the $631.3 million in net proceeds to pay the outstanding balance on a $150 million line of credit, which was subsequently terminated in February 2000. In fiscal 2002, we retired $64.9 million of these notes in exchange for 6.5 million shares of our common stock. In fiscal 2001, we retired $214.8 million of these notes in exchange for 19.2 million shares of our common stock and $15.3 million in cash. Debt issuance costs of $19.1 million were incurred in connection with the issuance of this debt and included in other assets. Through December 31, 2002, approximately $4.8 million had been amortized and reflected in corporate interest expense and $7.8 million removed in connection with the extinguishment of the $279.7 million of debt. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 29, 2001, We completed a private offering of $325 million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due May 2008. The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into a total of approximately 29.7 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $10.925 per share. The notes bear interest at 6.75%, payable semiannually, and are non callable for three years and may then be called by us at a premium, which declines over time. The holders have the right to require redemption at a premium in the event of a change in control or other defined redemption event. The net proceeds from this debt offering were used to repurchase $238.9 million of common shares, to fund merger and acquisition activity during fiscal 2001, and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs. Debt issuance costs of $10.5 million are included in other assets and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Technology Center Financing On March 27, 2002, we exercised our purchase option to purchase our 164,500 square foot technology operation center located near Atlanta, Georgia. We used the cash collateral of $71.9 million posted in accordance with the terms of the original lease agreement entered into on July 30, 1999 to acquire the related property. The funds used to purchase our technology facility were included in other assets through the date of purchase. Other Sources of Liquidity At December 31, 2002, we have financing facilities totaling $275 million to meet the needs of E*TRADE Clearing. These facilities, if used, would be collateralized by customer securities. There was $5.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2001, under these lines. We also have multiple loans collateralized by equipment owned by us, for which $23.7 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2002. We have also financed the purchase of fixed assets under capital leases, with an outstanding balance of $4.4 million at December 31, 2002. In addition, we have entered into numerous agreements with other broker dealers to provide financing under our stock loan program. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In our banking operations, we seek to maintain a stable funding source for future periods in part by attracting core deposit accounts, which are accounts that tend to be relatively stable even in a changing interest rate environment. Typically, time deposit accounts, transactional accounts and accounts that maintain a relatively high balance provide a relatively stable source of funding. At December 31, 2002, our average retail banking deposit account balance was approximately $20,000 and our banking customers maintained an average of 1.6 accounts. Savings and transactional deposits increased from $2.9 billion at December 31, 2001 to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of 48%. Retail certificates of deposit decreased from $5.2 billion at December 31, 2001 to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2002, or 29%. Brokered certificates of deposit increased from none at December 31, 2001 to $0.4 billion at December 31, 2002. We also rely on borrowed funds in our banking operations, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity. Total banking related borrowings increased 73% from $4.2 billion at December 31, 2001 to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, ETFC had approximately $2.9 billion in additional borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2002, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Due in Fiscal 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total General obligations: Convertible subordinated notes(1) $ 44,157 $ 44,157 $ 44,157 $ 44,157 $ 403,377 $ 335,969 $ 915,974 Operating lease payments 38,748 34,391 29,296 28,452 26,652 92,512 250,051 Venture capital funding commitments(2) 14,200 31,825 46,025 Facilities offered for sublease less estimated future sublease income(3) 47,692 5,778 3,690 3,620 3,029 5,313 69,122 Capital lease payments 3,674 766 148 4,588 Acquisition related employment agreements 1,880 1,880 Total general obligations(4) 150,351 116,917 77,291 76,229 433,058 433,794 1,287,640 Banking obligations: Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities(1) 8,903 9,079 9,079 9,079 9,079 209,103 254,322 Certificates of deposit(5)(6) 2,691,260 811,627 558,870 166,207 133,988 102,190 4,464,142 Borrowings by bank subsidiary(6) 6,479,455 479,527 161,806 110,186 50,000 7,280,974 Purchases of loans 601,141 601,141 Originations of loans(7) 1,341,917 1,341,917 Commitments to sell securities (130,460 ) (130,460 ) Commitments to purchase securities 241,682 241,682 Total banking obligations 11,233,898 1,300,233 729,755 285,472 193,067 311,293 14,053,718 Total contractual obligations $ 11,384,249 $ 1,417,150 $ 807,046 $ 361,701 $ 626,125 $ 745,087 $ 15,341,358 (1) Includes annual interest or dividend payments; does not assume early redemption under current call provisions.

(6) Includes annual interest based on the contractual features of each transaction, using market rates as of December 31, 2002. Interest rates were assumed to remain flat over the life of all adjustable rate instruments. (7) Contains optional commitment to originate. Other Commitments In June 1998, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK Corporation, a related party, to form E*TRADE Japan K.K. to provide online securities trading services to residents of Japan. As part of the 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements transaction, the Company invested approximately $8.0 million in exchange for a 42% ownership position in this joint venture. E*TRADE Japan K.K. issued shares to the public in an initial public offering in September 2000. Following E*TRADE Japan K.K.s initial public offering, we sold a portion of our investment recognizing a pre tax gain of $77.5 million, reducing our ownership percentage from 42% to 32% in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2001, E*TRADE Japan K.K. completed two additional acquisitions that resulted in a decrease of our ownership percentage to 30%. In March 2003, SOFTBANK announced the proposed merger of E*TRADE Japan K.K. with Softbank Finance, a subsidiary of SOFTBANK. The merger has been approved by the Board of Directors of E*TRADE Japan K.K. and remains subject to the approval of the E*TRADE Japan K.K. shareholders. Upon the closing of the merger, we will have a 19.9% investment in the newly merged entity. We do not expect to record a gain or loss upon the closing of the merger. As part of our commitment to the joint venture, we are required to provide a continuing level of systems support to E*TRADE Japan K.K. through June 2003; the cost of such support was $3.9 million in fiscal 2002, $4.4 million in fiscal 2001, $1.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000 and $2.5 million in fiscal 2000. The Company does not expect development commitments under this arrangement to be material in future periods. Other Liquidity Matters In the ordinary course of its business, E*TRADE Securities engaged in certain stock loan transactions with MJK Clearing, Inc., (MJK), involving the lending of Nasdaq listed common stock of GenesisIntermedia, Inc. (GENI), and other securities from MJK to E*TRADE Securities. Subsequently, E*TRADE Securities redelivered the GENI and or other securities received from MJK to three other broker dealers, Wedbush Morgan Securities, Nomura Securities, Inc. and Fiserv Securities, Inc. On September 25, 2001, Nasdaq halted trading in the stock of GENI, which had last traded at a price of $5.90 before the halt. As a result, MJK was unable to meet its collateral requirements on the GENI and other securities with certain counterparties to those transactions. Subsequently, MJK was ordered to cease operations by the SEC. These events have led to disputes between certain of the participants in the above described stock loan transactions. These actions seek various forms of equitable relief and seek repayment of a total of approximately $60 million, plus interest, received by E*TRADE Securities in connection with the GENI and other stock loan transactions. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these disputes. The Company, based on information available, does not believe that an estimable loss is probable. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters may be material to the Companys operating results or cash flows for any particular period. The Company is confident that E*TRADE Securities has sufficient capital in excess of regulatory requirements to cover any potential exposure arising from these matters. See Item 3. Legal and Administrative Proceedings for further information regarding this case. We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies and or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities increased by $2.1 billion or 845% from a net operating cash outflow of $254.7 million in fiscal 2001 to a net operating cash inflow of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2002. Cash provided from operating activities decreased by $116.0 million or 84% from a net operating cash outflow of $138.7 million fiscal 2000 to a net operating cash outflow of $254.7 million in fiscal 2001. The following table presents those significant activities affecting our operating cash position in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended September 30, 2000 Percentage Change 2002Versus2001 2001Versus2000 2002 2001 Selected Cash Flows From Operating Activities: Net income (loss) $ (186,405 ) $ (241,532 ) $ 19,152 23 % (1,361 )% Selected non cash charges: Cumulative effect of accounting change 293,669 % % Depreciation, amortization and discount accretion 325,980 179,126 97,638 82 % 83 % Non cash restructuring costs and other exit charges 11,880 96,793 (88 )% % Net effect of changes in brokerage related assets and liabilities 102,996 325,369 (413,299 ) (68 )% 179 % Net loans held for sale activity 2,533,052 (604,899 ) 12,600 519 % (4,901 )% Net trading securities activity (354,565 ) 128,705 33,550 (375 )% 284 % Other assets (325,223 ) 48,503 (61,333 ) (771 )% 179 % Operating cash from derivative activities (328,960 ) (29,176 ) (1,028 )% % Total other net activity* (175,186 ) (157,583 ) 173,000 (11 )% (191 )% Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 1,897,238 $ (254,694 ) $ (138,692 ) 845 % (84 )% * Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further detail included in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Fiscal 2002 During fiscal 2002, the increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in loans held for sale activity, net of $2.5 billion. This increase reflects the strategic decision to reclassify $2.7 billion in loans held for investment to loans held for sale and the subsequent sale of these loans to fund the purchase of a more diverse portfolio of loans, including consumer loans, and the acquisition of Ganis. When considered in conjunction with additional cash provided through financing activities of $3.4 billion, available cash resources in fiscal 2002 related to our bank activities were used to finance investing activities, which included net purchases of mortgage backed and investment securities totaling $3.5 billion and the purchase of Ganis for $1.9 billion. Activity offsetting cash provided through operations includes an increase in our other assets balance and cash used in derivative activities. The increase in other assets is primarily driven by $241.7 million recorded in fiscal 2002 for a Receivable for Bank securities sold, collateral not delivered (See Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in derivative activities reflects a strategic repositioning of the derivative securities portfolio, partially driven by the balance sheet reclassifications discussed above. Further impacting fiscal 2002, non cash items included in net loss increased from fiscal 2001, including the cumulative effect for the adoption of SFAS No. 142 resulting in the impairment of $293.7 million in goodwill as well as an increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflecting the increase in fixed assets related to capital expenditures of $117.6 million in fiscal 2002. Acquisitions completed in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements resulted in further increases in depreciation and amortization expense as we increased our fixed asset and intangible balances. Capital expenditures related to current operations are expected to decrease in fiscal 2003. Contributing to cash provided by operations, brokerage related activities provided $103.0 million in fiscal 2002, reflecting a 68% decrease from cash provided in fiscal 2001. The fluctuation in the brokerage receivable balance is correlated with changes in the brokerage payable balance. Fiscal 2001 During fiscal 2001, cash used in operating activities increased by 84% from fiscal 2000, primarily as a result of an increase in the purchase of loans held for sale activity, net of sales, and a significant increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities. Offsetting this outflow of cash was an increase in cash provided through net brokerage related activities and non cash activities recorded in fiscal 2001, including non cash charges related to our facility restructuring activities (See Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2001 reflects the activities related to the acquisitions of E*TRADE Mortgage and Dempsey. Cash Used in/ Provided by Investing and Financing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $5.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $5.0 billion for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively. For fiscal 2002, cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from purchases of mortgage backed and investment securities, available for sale, net of $3.5 billion and the acquisition of Ganis for $1.9 billion. For fiscal 2001, cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from an increase in loans receivable of $2.2 billion partially offset by the sale/maturity of mortgage backed and investment securities available for sale, net of $1.2 billion. Cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 billion, $1.9 billion and $5.3 billion for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively. For fiscal 2002, cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from a net increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $2.7 billion, an increase in banking deposits of $317.5 million and a net increase in advances from the FHLB of $404.0 million. For fiscal 2001, cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from an increase in banking deposits of $2.3 billion and the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated debt of $315.3 million, partially offset by a net decrease in advances from the FHLB of $830.7 million. Regulatory Capital Requirements The SEC, NYSE, NASD, OTS and various other international regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and regulatory capital by banks. Net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets. Minimum net capital requirements for our broker dealer subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 were fully met. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier I capital to risk weighted assets, Core Capital to adjusted tangible assets and of Tangible Capital to tangible assets. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain a minimum Total Capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 10.0%, Tier I Capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 6.0% and Core Capital to adjusted tangible assets ratio of 5.0%. As of December 31, 2002, the Bank was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements and its capital ratios exceeded the ratios for well capitalized institutions under OTS regulations (See Note 25 to Consolidated Financial Statements). 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs. SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally EITF Issue No. 94 3. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under Issue 94 3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the Companys commitment to an exit plan rather than when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts initially recognized. The Company will follow the provisions of SFAS No. 146 for any restructuring activities which may be initiated after December 31, 2002. In September 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 02 15, Determining Whether Certain Conversions of Convertible Debt to Equity Securities Are within the Scope of FASB Statement No. 84, Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt. SFAS No. 84 applies to all conversions that occur pursuant to revised conversion privileges that are exercisable only for a limited period of time and result in the issuance of all of the equity securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the debt offering, regardless of the party that initiates the offer or whether the offer relates to all debt holders. The consensus should be applied prospectively to all applicable inducements that close after September 12, 2002. The Company adopted EITF 02 15 effective September 12, 2002. Since September 12, 2002, no convertible debt was retired through a conversion to equity. In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 147, Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the acquisition of all or part of a financial institution. The statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of FASB Statement No. 72, Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions, and FASB Interpretation No. 9, Applying APB Opinions No. 16 and 17 When a Savings and Loan Association or Similar Institution Is Acquired in a Business Combination Accounted for by the Purchase Method. This statement also amends SFAS No. 144, to include long term customer relationship intangible assets such as depositor and borrower relationship assets. Accordingly, SFAS No. 147 may affect the accounting for future acquisitions of all or part of a financial institution. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 147 on October 1, 2002 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which provides alternative transition methods for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and prevents the use of the prospective transition method for companies who do not adopt the expensing method for stock compensation in fiscal 2003. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and quarterly financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has not changed the way it accounts for stock based employee compensation; however it has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148. In December 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 requires a company to disclose many of the guarantees or indemnification agreements it issues, some of which are required to be recorded as a liability in the companys consolidated balance sheet at the time it enters into the guarantee. FIN No. 45 requires disclosures beginning in interim and year end financial statements ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions. The liability recognition provisions apply prospectively to guarantees issued or modified beginning January 1, 2003. The Company does not believe the adoption of FIN No. 45 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN No. 46 addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities. Generally, a variable interest entity (VIE) is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with substantive voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. A VIE often holds financial assets and may be passive or it may engage in such activities as research and development or other activities on behalf of another company. FIN No. 46 requires that a VIE be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the VIEs risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary of that entity. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 apply immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to entities existing prior to January 31, 2003 in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003 regardless of when the VIE was established. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions and expects to adopt the consolidation requirements, if applicable, July 1, 2003. The Company is a party to various investment funds and joint ventures that may be considered to be VIEs. These include the E*TRADE eCommerce Fund I and ArrowPath Fund II. Our investments in these funds are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and have combined assets of $54.3 million. Unfunded commitments associated with these investments are $42.5 million (see Note 7). Excluding the E*TRADE eCommerce Fund I and ArrowPath Fund II investments, the Company does not have any unfunded commitments in investment funds and joint ventures that may be considered VIEs. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that the consolidation provisions of FIN No. 46 may have on the consolidated financial statements. RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATING TO THE NATURE OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources We face direct competition from retail and institutional brokerage firms, banks, thrifts and other savings and lending institutions, mortgage companies, specialists, market makers, insurance companies, ECNs, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, ATM providers, Internet portals, providers of equity compensation and other corporate focused financial products, financial advisors, financial media providers and other financial products and services organizations. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than we do and offer a wider range of financial products and services. Many also have greater name recognition, greater market acceptance, and larger customer bases. These competitors may conduct extensive promotional activities and offer better terms and lower prices to customers than we do. Moreover, some of our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services. This means that our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand market downturns better than we, and gain market share. It is also possible that new competitors, alliances or industry consolidation among existing or future competitors may significantly reduce our market share or our ability to compete effectively. Downturns or disruptions in the securities markets could reduce transaction volumes and margin borrowing and increase our dependence on our more active customers who receive lower prices A significant portion of our revenues in recent years has been from online investing services, and although we continue to diversify our revenue sources, we expect this business to continue to account for a significant 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Like other financial services firms, we are directly affected by national and global economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, disruptions to the securities markets and changes in volume and price levels of securities and futures transactions. A significant downturn in the U.S. securities markets has been occurring since March 2000, resulting in industry wide declines in transaction volume. The decrease in transaction volume has been more significant for us with respect to our less active customers, increasing our dependence on our more active Power E*TRADE and E*TRADE Professional Trading customers who receive more favorable pricing based on their transaction volume. Decreases in volumes, as well as securities prices, are also typically associated with a decrease in margin borrowing. Because we generate revenue from interest charged on margin borrowing, such decreases result in a reduction of revenue to E*TRADE Clearing. When transaction volume is low, our operating results are harmed in part because some of our overhead costs remain relatively fixed. Downturns in the securities markets increase the credit risk associated with margin lending or stock loan transactions We permit customers to purchase securities on margin. When the market declines rapidly, there is an increased risk that the value of the collateral we hold in connection with these transactions could fall below the amount of a customers indebtedness. Similarly, as part of our broker dealer operations, we frequently enter into arrangements with other broker dealers for the lending of various securities. Under regulatory guidelines, when we borrow or lend securities, we must generally simultaneously disburse or receive cash deposits. We may risk losses if there are sharp changes in market values of many securities and the counter parties to the borrowing and lending transactions fail to honor their commitments. The recent downturn in public equity markets has led to a greater risk that parties to stock lending transactions may fail to meet their commitments. We may be unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates and the interest bearing assets in our portfolio The results of operations for the Bank depend in large part upon the level of its net interest income, that is, the difference between interest income from interest earning assets (such as loans and mortgage backed securities) and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Changes in market interest rates and the yield curve could reduce the value of the Banks financial assets and reduce net interest income. Many factors affect interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk in various ways, including the following: As interest rates have declined, we have experienced increased demand for and revenues from mortgage loans. If interest rates increase, we would expect a potentially significant decline in our mortgage business. As part of its diversified portfolio of interest bearing assets, the Bank holds a portfolio of corporate bonds. With the recent economic downturn, there is an increased risk that some of these corporate bonds may become impaired before reaching maturity, or that they may not realize their full principal value upon maturity, which could cause the Banks portfolio to suffer impairment charges as losses are realized. The Bank attempts to mitigate interest rate risk in part by using derivative contracts that are designed to offset, in whole or in part, the variability in value or cash flow of various assets or liabilities caused by changes in interest rates. There can be no assurances that these derivative contracts will offer the intended protection against interest rate risk. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which we adopted on October 1, 2000, requires that the hedge ineffectiveness, or the difference between the changes in value of the hedged item versus the change in value of the hedging instruments, be recognized in earnings as of the reporting date. Our financial results may prove to be more volatile due to this reporting requirement. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Banks diversification of its asset portfolio to include riskier, higher yielding investments may increase the level of charge offs As the Bank diversifies its asset portfolio through purchases and originations of higher yielding asset classes, such as automobile, marine and RV loans and retained interests in asset securitizations, we will have to manage assets that carry a higher risk of default than our existing portfolio. Consequently, the level of charge offs associated with these assets may be higher than previously experienced. In addition, if the overall economy continues to weaken, we could experience higher levels of charge offs. If expectations of future charge offs increase, a corresponding increase in the amount of our loan loss allowance would be required. The increased level of provision for loan losses recorded to meet additional loan loss allowance requirements could adversely impact our financial results if those higher yields do not cover the provision for loan losses. Risks associated with trading transactions at our specialist/market maker could result in trading losses A majority of our specialist and market making revenues at Dempsey are derived from trading by Dempsey as a principal. Dempsey may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of securities for its own account as well as trading losses in its specialist stocks and market maker stocks. From time to time, Dempsey may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry. In general, because Dempseys inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis, any downward price movement in those securities will result in a reduction of revenues and operating profits. Dempsey also operates a proprietary trading desk separately from its specialist and market maker operations, which may also incur trading losses. Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers and or specialists could harm our specialist and market maker business The listed marketplaces have moved from trading using fractional share prices to trading using decimals. As a result, spreads that specialists and market makers receive in trading equity securities have declined and may continue to decline, which could harm revenues generated by Dempsey. Also, the advent of decimalization led to a decline in order flow revenue received by us from market makers and marketplaces. Similarly, a reduction in the volume and or volatility of trading activity could also reduce spreads that specialists and market makers receive, also adversely affecting revenues generated by Dempsey. Alternative trading systems that have developed over the past few years could also reduce the levels of trading of exchange listed securities through specialists and the levels of over the counter trading through market makers. In addition, ECNs have emerged as an alternative forum to which broker dealers and institutional investors can direct their limit orders. This allows broker dealers and institutional investors to avoid directing their trades through market makers. As a result, Dempsey may experience a reduction in its flow of limit orders. If we do not successfully manage consolidation opportunities, we could be at a competitive disadvantage There has been significant consolidation in the online financial services industry over the last several years, and the consolidation is likely to continue in the future. Should we fail to take advantage of viable consolidation opportunities or if we overextend our efforts by acquiring businesses that we are unable to integrate or properly manage, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Acquisitions entail numerous risks including retaining or hiring skilled personnel, integrating acquired operations, products and personnel and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on any of these investments or that future acquisitions will not be dilutive to earnings. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We must be able to quickly introduce new products and services in order to attract new customers and remain competitive Our future profitability depends significantly on our ability to develop, maintain and enhance our products, services and technology. There are significant challenges to such development, maintenance and enhancement, including: effectively using new technologies; effectively ensuring that the technologies we utilize are, and remain, stable and secure; adapting our products and services to meet emerging industry standards; and developing, introducing and marketing new products and services to meet and create customer demand. We rely heavily on technology to deliver products and services Disruptions to or instability of our technology, including an actual or perceived breach of the security of our technology, could harm our business and our reputation. Our international efforts subject us to additional risks and regulation, which could impair our business growth One component of our strategy is an increased effort to build our international business. To date, we have limited experience in providing retail brokerage and banking services internationally. There can be no assurance that our branded products and services will be successful in international markets. In order to expand our services globally, we must comply with the regulatory controls of each specific country in which we conduct business. We intend to rely primarily on our joint venture partners and or licensees and our subsidiaries for regulatory compliance in foreign jurisdictions. We have limited control over the management and direction of these venture partners and or licensees, and their action or inaction, including their failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and or corporate governance, could harm our operations and or our reputation. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the heavily regulated brokerage and banking industries, such as: unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and trade barriers; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; the level of investor interest in cross border trading; authentication of online customers; political instability; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world; the level of acceptance and adoption of the Internet in international markets; and potentially adverse tax consequences. RISKS RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS We are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation. All of our broker dealer subsidiaries have to comply with many laws and rules, including rules relating to possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending and execution and settlement of transactions. We are also subject 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to additional laws and rules as a result of our specialist and market maker operations in Dempsey. In addition, if we were deemed to solicit orders from our customers or make investment recommendations, we would become subject to additional rules and regulations governing, among other things, sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to customers. Similarly, E*TRADE Group, E*TRADE Re, LLC and ETFC, as savings and loan holding companies, and E*TRADE Bank, as a federally chartered savings bank and subsidiary of ETFC, are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS, and, in the case of the Bank, the FDIC. Such regulation covers all banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, record keeping, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel. In addition, we are also subject to the regulatory controls of each specific country in which we conduct business. Similarly, Federal, state and local governments may pass legislation affecting the privacy of financial information that could constrain our ability to communicate, or otherwise conduct business with existing or potential customers. If we fail to comply with applicable securities, banking and insurance regulations, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business The SEC, NYSE, CFTC and the NASD or other self regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can, among other things, censure, fine, issue cease and desist orders or suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees. The OTS may take similar action with respect to our banking activities. Similarly, the attorneys general of each of the states could bring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment, maintenance and enforcement of an effective compliance system. Our failure to establish and enforce proper compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions. If we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulators, we may be fined or even forced out of business The SEC, NYSE, NASD, CFTC, OTS and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and regulatory capital by banks. Net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets. Failure to maintain the required net capital could result in suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by the NYSE and or NASD, and could ultimately lead to the firms liquidation. In the past, our broker dealer subsidiaries have depended largely on capital contributions by us in order to comply with net capital requirements. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require an intensive use of capital could be limited. Such operations may include investing activities, marketing and the financing of customer account balances. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from brokerage subsidiaries could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends, repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock. See Note 25 of Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for the minimum net capital requirements for our domestic broker dealer subsidiaries for the current reporting period. Similarly, the Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could harm a banks operations and financial statements. A bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of a banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the strength of components of the banks capital, risk weightings of assets, off balance sheet transactions and other factors. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require a bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets. To satisfy the capital requirements for a well capitalized financial institution, a bank must maintain minimum Total and Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets ratios. See Note 25 of Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for the Bank for the current reporting period. Regulatory review of our advertising practices could hinder our ability to operate our business and result in fines and other penalties All marketing activities by our broker dealer subsidiaries that are regulated by the NASD, are required to have all marketing materials reviewed by a Series 24 licensed principal prior to release. The NASD has in the past asked us to revise certain marketing materials. In June 2001, we settled a formal NASD investigation into our advertising practices and were fined by the NASD in connection with three advertisements that were placed in 1999. The NASD can impose certain penalties for violations of its advertising regulations, including: censures or fines; suspension of all advertising; the issuance of cease and desist orders; or the suspension or expulsion of a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees. In addition, the federal banking agencies impose restrictions on bank advertising of non deposit investment products to minimize the likelihood of customer confusion. As a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulations that could restrict our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities We, as well as the Bank, are required to file periodic reports with the OTS, and are subject to examination by the OTS. The OTS also has certain types of enforcement powers over ETFC and us, including the ability to issue cease and desist orders, force divestiture of the Bank and impose civil money penalties for violations of federal banking laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, our activities are now restricted to those that are financial in nature and certain real estate related activities. We may make merchant banking investments in companies whose activities are not financial in nature if those investments are made for the purpose of appreciation and ultimate resale of the investment and we do not manage or operate the company. Such merchant banking investments may be subject to maximum holding periods and special record keeping and risk management requirements. We believe that all of our existing activities and investments are permissible under the new legislation, but the OTS has not yet interpreted these provisions. Even if our existing activities and investments are permissible, we will be unable to pursue future activities that are not financial in nature. We are also limited in our ability to invest in other savings and loan holding companies. In addition to regulation as a savings and loan holding company, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation of its activities and investments, capitalization, risk management policies and procedures and relationship with affiliated companies. In addition, as a condition to approving our acquisition of ETFC, the OTS imposed various notice and other requirements, primarily a requirement that the Bank obtain prior approval from the OTS of any future material changes to the Banks business plan. Acquisitions of and mergers with other financial institutions, purchases of deposits and loan portfolios, the establishment of new Bank subsidiaries and the commencement of new activities by Bank subsidiaries require the prior approval of the OTS. These regulations and conditions could place us at a competitive disadvantage in an environment in which consolidation within the financial services industry is prevalent. Also, these regulations and conditions could affect our ability to realize synergies from future acquisitions, could negatively affect both us and the Bank following the acquisition and could also delay or prevent the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RISKS RELATING TO OWNING OUR STOCK We have incurred losses in the past and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable We have incurred operating losses in prior periods and we may do so in the future. We reported net losses of $186.4 million in fiscal 2002, which includes a cumulative effect of accounting change of $293.7 million, net losses of $241.5 million in fiscal 2001, which includes pre tax facility restructuring and other exit charges of $202.8 million and net income of $19.2 million in fiscal 2000. Although we achieved profitability in fiscal 2000 due in part to sales of investment securities, we cannot assure you that profitability will be achieved in future periods. Our ratio of debt to equity may make it more difficult to make payments on our debts or to obtain financing At December 31, 2002, we had an outstanding balance of $695.3 million in convertible subordinated notes. Combined with the share buyback program through December 2002, and the cumulative effect of accounting change recorded in fiscal 2002, our ratio of debt (our convertible debt, capital lease obligations and term loans) to equity (expressed as a percentage) was 46.9% as of December 31, 2002. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it more difficult to make payments on our debt; make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile From January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002, the price per share of our common stock has ranged from a high of $15.38 to a low of $2.81. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In the past, volatility in the market price of a companys securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key employees, reduce our access to capital and otherwise harm our business. We may need additional funds in the future which may not be available and which may result in dilution of the value of our common stock In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our business growth plans. In addition, if funds are available, the issuance of securities could dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall. We have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a shareholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include: authorization for the issuance of blank check preferred stock; provision for a classified Board of Directors with staggered, three year terms; the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors; a super majority voting requirement to effect business combinations or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements limits on the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; and advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings. Attempts to acquire control of E*TRADE may also be delayed or prevented by our stockholder rights plan, which is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to protect shareholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of E*TRADE that do not offer an adequate price to all shareholders or are otherwise not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. In addition, certain provisions of our stock incentive plans, management retention and employment agreements (including severance payments and stock option acceleration), and Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, we have evaluated such risks for our Domestic Retail Brokerage, Banking, Global and Institutional, and Wealth Management and Other segments separately. The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors. DOMESTIC RETAIL BROKERAGE, GLOBAL AND INSTITUTIONAL AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND OTHER Our Domestic Retail Brokerage, Global and Institutional, and Wealth Management and Other operations are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk. However, we do not believe any such exposures are material. To reduce certain risks, we use derivative financial instruments, none of which are held for speculative or trading purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity As of December 31, 2002, we had variable rate term loans of approximately $23.7 million outstanding. The monthly interest payments on these term loans are subject to interest rate risk. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by one percent at December 31, 2002, the interest payments would increase by an immaterial amount. The Company had a $50 million cash secured line of credit under an agreement with a bank that expired in October 2002. The Company did not renew the line of credit. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consists of brokerage and investment services outside of the United States. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide our services. We are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates on the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based revenues decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based revenues increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens. We are a net payer of British pounds and, as such, benefit from a stronger dollar, and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar relative to the British pound. However, we are a net receiver of currencies other than British pounds, and as such, benefit from a weaker dollar, and are harmed by a stronger dollar relative to these currencies. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated sales and operating margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements To mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on our non U.S. dollar based revenues and operating expenses, we evaluate the costs and benefits to hedging our material net non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts. Currently, hedges of transactions do not extend beyond twelve months and are immaterial. Given the short term nature of our foreign exchange forward contracts, our exposure to risk associated with currency market movement on the instruments is not material. Financial Instruments For our working capital and reserves, which are required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations, we primarily invest in money market funds, resale agreements, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Money market funds do not have maturity dates and do not present a material market risk. The other financial instruments are fixed rate investments with short maturities and do not present a material interest rate risk. BANKING OPERATIONS Our banking operations acquire and manage interest bearing assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. Interest bearing instruments include investment securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and derivative financial instruments. These instruments are subject to changes in market value as interest rates change. Market risk is the potential for adverse decline in market values. The market values of bank instruments have a direct or indirect impact on Bank earnings, equity and various regulatory constraints. Interest Rate Risk The acquisition, maintenance, and disposition of assets and liabilities are critical elements of the Banks operations. Throughout the process these instruments are subject to market risk, which is the potential for adverse declines in market values. There are numerous factors that may influence the speed and direction of changes in market value including, but not limited to, liquidity, the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and the implied volatility of future interest rate movements. The net market values of bank instruments may directly or indirectly impact the Banks current or future earnings and is also subject to certain regulatory constraints. Day to day management of market risk is the responsibility of the Banks Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). The ALCO is responsible for measuring, managing and reporting the Banks aggregate market risk within established policy guidelines and limits, which are reviewed periodically. The Bank maintains a Risk Management Group, which is independent of the Banks portfolio management functions to assist the ALCO in its responsibilities of measuring and managing market risk. The market risk profile of the Bank is a net result of the combination of all interest sensitive assets, liabilities and derivatives. At December 31, 2002, approximately 63% of the market value of the Banks total assets was comprised of residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. The Banks liability structure consists primarily of transactional deposit relationships such as money market accounts, shorter term certificates of deposit, and wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities. The derivative portfolio of the Bank is positioned to decrease the overall market risk resulting from the combination of assets and liabilities. The Banks market risk is discussed and quantified in more detail in the Scenario Analysis section below. Most of the Banks assets are generally classified as non trading portfolios and, as such, are not marked to market through earnings for accounting purposes. The Bank did maintain a trading portfolio of investment grade securities throughout 2002. The market value of the trading portfolio at December 31, 2002 was $392 million. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the Net Present Value of Equity (NPVE) approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and then combined to produce a NPVE figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up 100, 200 and 300 basis points and down 100 basis points. The down 200 and 300 basis point scenarios are not presented because they result in negative interest rates. The sensitivity of NPVE as of December 31, 2001 and 2002 and the limits established by the Banks board of directors are listed below: Parallel Change in Interest Rates (bps) Change in NPVEAs of December 31, 2002 Change in NPVEAs of December 31, 2001 Board Limit +300 29% 13% 55% +200 18% 11% 30% +100 7% 6% 15% Base Case 100 2% 3% 15% As of December 31, 2002 the Banks overall interest rate risk exposure would be classified as minimal under the criteria published by the OTS. Derivative Financial Instruments The Bank employs derivative financial instruments to help manage the Banks interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps are used to lower the duration of specific fixed rate assets or increase the duration of specific adjustable rate liabilities. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the change of market values resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the Banks mortgage portfolios. The types of options the Bank employs are primarily Cap Options (Caps) and Floors Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps benefit from increases in market interest rates while Floors benefit from decreases in market interest rates. Payor Swaptions benefit from increases in market interest rates while Receiver Swaptions benefit from decreases in market interest rates. The total notional amount of derivative financial instruments relative to total assets is largely the result of the Banks exposure to mortgage securities and loans which involve both sensitivity to interest rates and sensitivity to the rates at which the borrowers exercise their option to prepay their loans if interest rates decline. Consequently, a mortgage instrument is hedged with a combination of interest rate swaps, cap and floor options. At December 31, 2002, the Bank had derivatives with $9.1 billion in total notional outstanding in comparison to $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001. Interest rate swaps at December 31, 2002, were $6.2 billion in notional with an unrealized loss of $150 million. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by the net decrease of interest rates in 2002. The Bank primarily uses payer positions in which the Bank pays a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount and receives a floating rate in exchange. The terms and conditions of the swaps are intended to be industry standard to maintain the liquidity of the instruments. At December 31, 2002, the notional amounts of options were $350 million in caps, $375 million in floors and $2.1 billion in swaptions. At December 31, 2001, the notional amounts of options were $3.8 billion in caps and $0.7 billion in floors. At September 30, 2000, the Bank had $5.3 billion in interest rate swap notional with an unrealized loss of $38.5 million. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The decrease in the notional value of the Banks derivative portfolio was offset by a change in the composition of the portfolio such that a similar level of protection was maintained with lower notional balances. The average maturity of the pay fixed interest rate swap portfolio was extended to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. The cap portfolio was transitioned to a swaption portfolio that offered more precisely targeted protection. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted on October 1, 2000. See Notes 2 and 28 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on SFAS No. 133. Mortgage Production Activities In the production of mortgage product, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk between the commitment dates of the loans and their funding dates. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were $1.1 billion and $0.4 billion in mortgage loan commitments awaiting funding, respectively. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
