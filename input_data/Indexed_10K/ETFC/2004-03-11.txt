ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. OVERVIEW We are a global financial services company offering retail, corporate and institutional customers an integrated and complementary array of investing, banking and lending products and services. Since we offer and deliver our products and services primarily through the Internet and other electronic media, our current and potential customer base is geographically dispersed and we have a lower operating cost structure than traditional brick and mortar financial services companies. During the past two years, we have focused on broadening our portfolio of products and services to increase our customer base, improve profitability and reduce risk to the Company and our shareholders. The results of this strategy have allowed our Company to perform better during the recent economic downturn and report an increase in net income over the period. In the future, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to streamline, diversify, expand and seamlessly integrate our services to provide greater value to our customers and our shareholders. It must be recognized, however, that we face numerous challenges, obstacles and risks in responding to the dynamics of the financial services industry, which is characterized by increasingly rapid change, evolving customer demands and intense competition. We encourage you to review closely the Risk Factors beginning on page 34 to understand the risks that we face that could have a significant impact on our future financial performance. Our business is analyzed in two segments, Brokerage and Banking, which have different characteristics. The Brokerage Segment produces revenues primarily from commissions and margin lending. The Banking Segment earns interest from its diversified interest earning assets and generates fee based income. The Brokerage business continues to be the primary point of introduction for the majority of our customers, and we have added Banking products and services, which complement our Brokerage business. During 2003, we lowered our cost of funds in the Bank by sweeping Brokerage customer money market balances into an FDIC insured Sweep Deposit Account product, allowing the Bank to obtain lower cost of funds and provide our Brokerage customers a higher rate of return. In addition, the Bank has added higher yielding consumer loans to its portfolio of products that we will continue to introduce to Brokerage customers. In 2004, we see an opportunity in the current market for growth in retail Brokerage daily average revenue trades, customers and assets. To take advantage of this opportunity we plan to increase our investment in marketing by targeting this segment of our business. Additionally, we will continue to focus on lowering the cost of providing bank and brokerage services to our customers through innovative technology and operating efficiencies through additional integration of back office systems and processes. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is divided into the following sections: Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates describes key accounting policies and estimates that are critical to the way we measure and report on our financial performance; Results of Operations provides insight into the reasons that the financial performance of our Company changed during the past three years; Liquidity and Capital Resources describes how we obtained and used cash to operate the business; and Risk Factors describes the risks, obstacles and challenges that we face that could adversely affect our future operations and financial performance. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. Allowances for loan losses and uncollectible margin loans Management evaluates the Banks loan portfolio and establishes an allowance that it believes is at least equal to the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. When establishing this allowance, management considers a number of factors including historical and industry loss rates, estimated cash flows and collateral values as well as quantitative factors such as adjustments to policies and procedures, changes affecting third party service providers and other market factors that may influence the overall credit performance of the Banks loans. This analysis is performed both for individual loans with large balances, as well as for groups of loans with similar risk characteristics. Although the Company has considerable experience in performing these reviews, if managements underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or significant unanticipated changes to the national or regional economies occur, the allowance for loan losses would have to be adjusted. If the loan losses that we actually incur are significantly different from our estimates, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses in the future. If we do not provide for an adequate allowance for loan losses, we may incur additional charges to loan losses. At December 31, 2003, our allowance for loan losses was $37.8 million on $8.2 billion of loans we intend to hold for investment. In addition to our banking loans, we sometimes extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin loans. At December 31, 2003, margin accounts had approximately $1.8 billion in outstanding margin loans for which we provided an allowance for uncollectible margin loans of $1.1 million based on historical experience, as well as the review of certain individual customer accounts and the specific identification of uncollectible amounts. Classification and valuation of certain investments The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. Investment classifications are subject to ongoing review and change. When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing losses based on market conditions and other factors. If our estimates change, we may recognize additional losses. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our Bank are recognized in gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net. Our brokerage operations hold trading securities for market making purposes and record the net gains in revenues as principal transactions. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value, which we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net for our banking investments and gain (loss) on investments for our non banking investments. Impairment of mortgage backed or asset backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security fails both tests, the Company writes the security down to fair value. The Company assesses securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. During 2003, we recognized $8.0 million of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments in privately held companies. Valuation and accounting for financial derivatives The Banks principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are customer deposits and other short term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long term and short term interest rates. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased. In order to qualify as a hedge, a derivative must be designated as such by management, who must also continue to demonstrate that the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item. We designated substantially all derivatives we held on December 31, 2003 as hedges. By doing so, the balance sheet items that we determine are hedged in fair value hedge relationships and the derivatives themselves are adjusted to market value, resulting in a net offset in the statements of operations to the extent the hedge is ineffective. To determine whether a derivative instrument will continue to meet the effectiveness requirements, we must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. Estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheets in other assets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we record a corresponding tax expense on our statements of operations. Conversely, when it subsequently becomes apparent that a valuation allowance is no longer required due to changes in circumstances, this portion of the valuation allowance is reversed and reduces our overall income tax expense. Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $84.5 million and $112.2 million respectively, net of the valuation allowance of $70.2 million and $92.2 million respectively. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain net operating losses carried forward by both international and domestic subsidiaries as well as certain capital loss carryforwards before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income or capital gains expected to arise in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. During 2003, we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards as a result of our gains associated with our investment in Softbank Investment Corporation (SBI). 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We could be required to increase the valuation allowances to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase. Valuation of goodwill and other intangibles We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Assets. In 2002, we recorded a $293.7 million charge, primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment of our international acquisitions as determined by our evaluation of each operating units forecasted operating results and our estimates of fair values of the tangible and intangible assets of these units. This impairment was due to the change in the evaluation from an undiscounted cash flow approach to a discounted approach. In 2003, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill with the assistance of a third party. This evaluation indicated that no additional impairment charge was necessary. The Companys recorded goodwill at December 31, 2003 of $402.5 million, will continue to be evaluated for impairment at least annually. We evaluate the remaining useful lives on intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. If estimates of useful lives are changed, the unamortized cost is allocated to the revised useful life and amortized over that period in a manner consistent with which that asset is consumed or contributes to the net revenues of the Company. The Company changed the name of Ganis Credit Corporation to E*TRADE Consumer Finance Corporation, and as a result, the Company accelerated and fully amortized its intangible asset associated with the Ganis Credit Corporation name. There have been no other events or circumstances that have warranted a revision to the originally estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The Companys recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $144.0 million and $157.9 million, respectively, which have useful lives between three and thirty years. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated E*TRADE Financial Results During 2003, our net income was $203.0 million compared to 2002 when we incurred a net loss of $186.4 million and a net loss of $241.5 million in 2001. The following sections describe the changes in key operating factors, and other changes and events that have affected the Companys consolidated revenues, cost of services, operating expenses and non operating income from 2001 to 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues increased in 2003 to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in 2002. Of our two segments, the Bank generated greater operating income in the first three quarters of 2003, as a result of high volumes of new mortgage origination spurred by low interest rates. However, by the end of 2003, the Brokerage Segment was generating more operating income due to increased activity in the equity markets and strong retail investor activity levels; the contributions of our mortgage operations during that period declined dramatically as refinancing activity declined. Trading volumes increased in each of the last three quarters of 2003, with the strongest growth in our U.S. retail market. If market activity continues at strong levels, we expect the Brokerage Segment to continue to generate more operating income than the Banking Segment in 2004. Increased market activity leads to expected higher trading volumes at the Brokerage Segment, while fewer pre payments, and a lower cost of funds contribute to a continuing increase in our net interest spread in the Banking Segment. In total, the Brokerage Segment reported $879.1 million of net revenues in 2003, compared to $862.2 million in 2002 and 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $911.4 million in 2001. The Banking Segment reported $604.6 million of net revenues in 2003, compared to $463.7 million in 2002 and $363.9 million in 2001. See the section titled Analysis of Segment Revenues for a detailed discussion about the changes in revenue for each segment. Cost of Services and Operating Expenses In each of 2003 and 2002, the Company implemented a number of initiatives to restructure and streamline our operations to improve the overall efficiency of the Company. Cost of services, which represents the compensation, transaction, infrastructure and overhead costs that we incur to provide service to our customers, increased to $618.4 million in 2003 from $567.2 million in 2002 and $595.6 million in 2001. The increase in 2003 is largely attributable to the cost associated with offering new products and services, including the cost of service associated with the operations of E*TRADE Consumer Finances of $19.8 million, which we purchased in December 2002. However, cost of services, as a percentage of net revenues, decreased to 42% in 2003 from 43% in 2002 and 47% in 2001. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was caused primarily by scale efficiencies in the brokerage business. E*TRADE Professional was acquired in June 2002 and the operations added $26.2 million in cost of services in 2003, over the amount in 2002. Other brokerage businesses experienced a reduction in cost of services despite a significant increase in customer trading activity. General and administrative expense, which consists principally of compensation and overhead for executive and administrative personnel and other corporate costs, increased 21% from $210.6 million in 2002 to $255.7 million in 2003 and decreased 11% from $236.4 million in 2001 to 2002. The increase in 2003 was caused primarily by an increase in employee bonus of $28.5 million and litigation settlement accruals of $14.3 million. In addition, the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects the operations of E*TRADE Consumer Finance of $11.5 million, which we acquired in December 2002 and the operations of E*TRADE Professional which we acquired in June 2002 of $5.0 million. The decrease from 2001 to 2002 related to our 2001 restructuring plan and savings from execution of a new employment agreement with our former CEO. Selling and marketing reflects expenditures for advertising campaigns, independent research provided to our institutional customers and fees paid by our market makers to outside broker dealers for orders received for execution. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 15% from $203.6 million in 2002 to $173.1 million in 2003 primarily due to the end of a significant rebranding campaign, which included sponsorship of the 2002 Superbowl. In addition, we realized savings from the recent closure of E*TRADE FINANCIAL Centers and Zones, which were part of our 2003 restructuring plan. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 20% from $253.4 million in 2001 to 2002, primarily due to the implementation of a strategy that focuses on higher value customers, which allowed a reduction in advertising, online, direct mailing and other promotion activities. We expect to increase brokerage related advertising spending in 2004 in an effort to acquire additional customers and increase volume in a rising equity market environment. Facility restructuring and other exit charges were $134.6 million in 2003, $16.5 million in 2002 and $202.8 million in 2001. The charges for 2003 resulted from the 2003 restructuring plan of $113.0 million, recognition of additional facility restructuring expense of $16.4 million, resulting from updated estimates of sublease income and a delay in sublease start dates anticipated in our 2001 restructuring plan and $5.2 million related to other exit activity. In 2001, we announced a restructuring plan aimed at streamlining operations primarily by consolidating facilities in the United States and Europe. This restructuring resulted in a charge of $202.8 million in 2001. The charge also included a write off of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures totaling $38.6 million for 2001. In 2001, we also recorded a non cash charge of $52.5 million related to the write off of capitalized software and hardware, related to certain technology projects and other fixed assets, which are longer used. Non Operating Income (Expense) Corporate interest expense primarily reflects the interest expense resulting from the issuance of $325 million of 6.75% convertible subordinated notes in 2001 and $650 million of 6% convertible subordinated notes in 2000. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Corporate interest expense was $45.6 million in 2003, $47.7 million in 2002 and $52.9 million in 2001. On December 31, 2003, we had $695 million outstanding of convertible subordinated notes. We have retired $280 million of our convertible subordinated notes through share and cash exchanges since 2001. Gain (loss) on investments was a gain of $147.5 million for 2003, a loss of $18.5 million for 2002 and $49.8 million for 2001. The gain in 2003 was primarily due to a change in accounting treatment for our holding in E*TRADE Japan K.K., as well as subsequent sales of these holdings. On June 2, 2003, E*TRADE Japan K.K. merged with SBI. Upon closing of the merger, we owned 19.8% of SBI and determined that we no longer exercised significant influence or control over SBI to account for our ownership under the equity method and, therefore, began to account for our investment in SBI at fair value as an available for sale investment security. We recognized a $29.5 million gain on investment based on the fair value of the SBI shares received in excess of our book value on the June 2, 2003 exchange date. During 2003, we sold shares of SBI resulting in a gain of $122.2 million. At December 31, 2003, we owned 9.07% of SBI and the fair value of our investment in SBI was $216.8 million, with a gross unrealized gain of $178.4 million. We also recorded other than temporary impairment charges related to investments in privately held companies accounted for under the cost method of $8.0 million for 2003, $12.5 million for 2002 and $30.0 million for 2001. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense (benefit) represents the expense for worldwide income taxes at an effective tax rate of 36.2% for 2003, 43.9% for 2002 and a benefit of 7.6% for 2001. The rate for 2003 reflects a decrease in tax expense due to the reversal of valuation allowance resulting from the realization of capital gains on our shares of SBI; offset by a tax expense increase due to valuation allowances for operating losses in foreign jurisdictions, and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to investments and joint ventures. The rate for 2002 reflects a decrease in taxes due to reversal of foreign loss valuation allowances as operations in certain jurisdictions became profitable, an increase in taxes due to valuation allowance for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and capital losses for which no benefit was recognized. The rate for 2001 reflects a decrease in the tax benefit for non deductible expenses, such as certain compensation and the amortization of goodwill, differences between our statutory and foreign effective tax rates and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Cumulative effect of accounting change was $293.7 million in 2002, which was due to our adoption of SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002. Goodwill was tested for impairment using fair value tests and, as a result, we wrote down goodwill associated with certain of our international subsidiaries acquired in previous years. Analysis of Segment Revenues Brokerage Segment Revenues During 2003, our Brokerage Segment generated nearly 60% of the Companys net revenues. Our net brokerage revenues increased 2% to $879.1 million in 2003 from $862.2 million in 2002 mainly due to an increase in commissions as a result of a resurgence in market activity offset by a decrease in net brokerage interest income attributable to lower interest rates and tightening of the spread between free credit balances and margin lending. Net brokerage revenues decreased 5% in 2002 from $911.4 million in 2001 because of lower average commission per brokerage revenue trade reflecting the implementation of a simplified $9.99 flat commission rate program for the most active trader segment in June 2002 and lower customer margin balances. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table sets forth the components of both gross and net revenues for our Brokerage Segment and percentage change information for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003Versus2002 2002Versus2001 Brokerage revenues: Commissions $ 337,468 $ 294,791 $ 377,704 14 % (22 )% Principal transactions 229,846 223,531 157,949 3 % 42 % Other brokerage related 177,682 174,263 156,690 2 % 11 % Brokerage interest income 144,379 182,103 305,581 (21 )% (40 )% Brokerage interest expense (10,305 ) (12,515 ) (86,489 ) (18 )% (86 )% Net brokerage revenues $ 879,070 $ 862,173 $ 911,435 2 % (5 )% Other key criteria that we use to measure the performance of our Brokerage Segment and explain the results of our Brokerage operations are presented in the following table: December 31, Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003versus2002 2002versus2001 Total brokerage revenue trades(1) 29,814,930 21,866,047 21,942,944 36 % % Brokerage daily average revenue trades (DARTs)(1) 119,260 87,464 89,018 36 % (2 )% Average commission per revenue trade $ 11.32 $ 13.48 $ 17.21 (16 )% (22 )% Average (dollars in millions): Customer margin balances $ 1,225 $ 1,250 $ 2,092 (2 )% (40 )% Customer money market fund balances $ 7,536 $ 7,743 $ 8,525 (3 )% (9 )% Stock borrow balances $ 366 $ 317 $ 1,270 15 % (75 )% Stock loan balances $ 675 $ 441 $ 1,761 53 % (75 )% Customer credit balances $ 2,134 $ 1,471 $ 1,568 45 % (6 )% (1) Total brokerage revenue trades and daily average revenue trades (DARTs) include domestic, international and professional revenue trades. DARTs differ from daily average transactions, which we reported in the past, in that transactions include both revenue and non revenue executions, while excluding professional and other commission based revenue trades. We believe DARTs offer a more comparable commission per trade measure. We earn Brokerage commissions when customers execute trades. These commissions are primarily affected by brokerage revenue trade volume, average commission per brokerage revenue trade and trade mix. Total brokerage revenue trades increased from 2002 to 2003 and remained relatively flat from 2001 to 2002, because of general economic conditions and a resurgence in market activity during 2003. The decreases in average commission per revenue trade were due primarily to the implementation of a simplified $9.99 flat commission rate program in June 2002 for the active trader market, but were also due in part to changes in trade mix. Principal transactions include institutional revenues, market making revenues and certain net proprietary trading gains. The 2003 increase is due to resurgence in institutional and market making activity. The increase in 2002 was due to the impact of a full year in 2002 of market making revenue from Dempsey. Other brokerage related revenues include account maintenance fees, payments for order flow from outside market makers, stock plan administration products and services revenue, professional trading rebate revenues, proprietary fund revenues and fees for brokerage related services. The increases from 2001 to 2003 are primarily due to an increase in professional trading rebate revenues, following the acquisition of E*TRADE Professional in June 2002, proprietary fund revenues and fees (in lieu of interest, which was previously recorded in brokerage 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements interest income) received from the Bank as the Company began managing customer assets that had previously been managed by a third party, offset by decreases in payment for order flow revenue and account maintenance fee revenue. The 2002 increase also includes a $6.0 million gain on the sale of the Companys shares in the Toronto Stock Exchange. Brokerage interest income includes interest earned on margin loans and regulatory cash and investments and fees on customer assets invested in money market accounts. The decrease in 2003 was due to a reduction in average margin interest rates and a reduction in interest income associated with the internalization of the money market funds offered to our customers beginning in October 2002. The decrease in 2002 was due to the general market decline, and the resulting decline in the value of net assets held by investors and reduced borrowings on margin by customers. Brokerage interest expense includes interest paid to customers on certain credit balances and interest paid to banks and interest paid to other broker dealers through a brokerage subsidiarys stock loan program. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 was due to an overall decrease in interest rates, offset by an increase in average stock loan balances. The decrease from 2001 to 2002 was also due to an overall decrease in interest rates and reduced margin borrowings. Banking Segment Revenues Net banking revenues increased 30% to $604.6 million in 2003 from $463.7 million in 2002 and 27% in 2002 from $363.9 million in 2001. These increases are primarily attributable to low interest rates in 2002 and 2003 that spurred mortgage originations and the associated gain on sales of originated loans. Banking revenues also benefited from an increase in other banking related revenues, including management fees earned from proprietary mutual funds reflected in other banking related revenues and from the acquisition of E*TRADE Consumer Finance in December 2002. The increase in net banking revenues from 2001 to 2003 was partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses which were made to reflect changes in the size, composition and seasoning of the Banks loan portfolio. The components of our Banking segments net revenues and percentage change information were as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003 Versus 2002 2002 Versus 2001 Banking revenues: Gain on sales of originated loans $ 192,467 $ 128,506 $ 95,478 50 % 35 % Gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net 97,261 80,256 70,104 21 % 14 % Other banking related 80,730 50,665 38,587 59 % 31 % Banking interest income 748,527 767,587 859,042 (2 )% (11 )% Banking interest expense (475,824 ) (548,659 ) (691,806 ) (13 )% (21 )% Provision for loan losses (38,523 ) (14,664 ) (7,476 ) * * Net banking revenues $ 604,638 $ 463,691 $ 363,929 30 % 27 % * Percentage change not meaningful Gain on sales of originated loans includes gains on loans made by E*TRADE Mortgage and E*TRADE Consumer Finance. The increase from 2001 to 2003 was due to an increased level of direct to customer mortgage loan originations, which reflects higher refinance and home purchase volumes spurred by continuing low mortgage interest rates. In addition, 2003 results reflect $4.8 million of gains from the sales of RV and marine loans, following the acquisition of E*TRADE Consumer Finance. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net represents net gains from the sales of loans the Company intended to sell within one year, as well as gains from the sales of securities sold by the Bank. The following table presents the net gains that the Company earned from the sales of loans held for sale and securities for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003Versus2002 2002Versus2001 Gain on sales of loans held for sale, net $ 186 $ 26,104 $ 24,306 (99 )% 7 % Gain on sales of securities, net 97,075 54,152 45,798 79 % 18 % Total $ 97,261 $ 80,256 $ 70,104 21 % 14 % Gain on sales of loans held for sale, net decreased in 2003 primarily because of a decline in the volume of correspondent loan sales and securitizations. The increase in gain on sales of securities, net in 2003 was due to the realization of a $34.6 million gain on sales of interest only securities, net of associated impairment in 2003, contrasted with a $32.9 million loss in 2002. The increase in 2003 was partially offset by a $31.4 million decline in the gain from the sales of mortgage backed securities and trading accounts from 2002 levels. The increase in the gain on sales of securities in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily attributable to increased gains from the sales of mortgage backed securities, partially offset by losses recognized on interest only securities net of related impairment, derivative instruments and an investment security. Other banking related revenues include ATM transaction fees, credit card fees, servicing fees and other banking fees imposed on deposit and transactional accounts and management fees. Approximately 60%, or $17.8 million of the 2003 increase, was attributable to management fees resulting from the internalization of certain money market fund management fees to our customers. ATM and credit card fees also increased $6.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, reflecting the purchases of XtraCash ATMs and a credit card portfolio in 2003. Finally, 2003 results include $4.5 million of fees that E*TRADE Consumer Finance receives for providing management services to Thor Credit Corporation, a joint venture of which 50% was acquired in December 2002 as part of the E*TRADE Consumer Finance acquisition. In 2002, other banking related revenues increased from 2001 primarily because of higher bank fees and higher ATM transaction surcharge volume resulting from the May 2000 acquisition of E*TRADE Access. Banking interest income is received by the Bank from interest earning assets (primarily loans receivable and mortgage backed securities). Several factors affect interest income, including: the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of interest earning assets; the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; market rate fluctuations and asset quality. The 2003 decrease reflects a lower average yield due to the decline in market interest rates, partially offset by increases in average interest earning banking asset balances and increases in higher yielding interest earning assets, such as consumer loans. Average interest earning banking assets increased 25% from 2002 to 2003 and 11% from 2001 to 2002, offsetting the decrease from the average yield on interest earning banking assets which were 4.37% for 2003, 5.60% for 2002 and 6.96% for 2001. Banking interest expense is incurred through interest bearing banking liabilities that include customer deposits, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings. The decrease in banking interest expense reflects a lower average cost of borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing banking liability balances, which increased 25% from 2002 to 2003 and 14% from 2001 to 2002. The average cost of borrowings decreased to 2.87% in 2003 from 4.14% in 2002, which decreased from 5.96% in 2001. Net interest spread is the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning banking assets less the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing banking liabilities. Net interest spread increased to 1.50% in 2003 from 1.46% in 2002 and 1.00% in 2001. The increases in 2003 and 2002 reflect several initiatives put in place to lower our cost of funding by shifting the structure of our deposits from time deposits to transactional accounts that carry a lower cost of funds than certificates of deposit and improving overall spreads, 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements including the Banks asset diversification strategy. The effect of these spread widening initiatives was partially offset by continued downward pressure from increased prepayment and sale activity with respect to our mortgage products. Allowance for loan losses is an accounting estimate of credit losses inherent in the Banks loan portfolio. Consistent with our existing policy, management believes the allowance for loan losses balance at December 31, 2003 is at least equal to the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio for the next twelve months. The allowance for loan losses allocated to consumer loans rose from $23.5 million at December 31, 2002 to $32.2 million at December 31, 2003 primarily due to growth in the Companys consumer loan portfolio. During 2003, the Bank purchased and originated $4.5 billion of consumer loans, including the acquisition of $1.2 billion of existing portfolios of automobile, credit card and home equity loans through the secondary market. Credit card loans typically have higher charge off rates and loss severities than other types of consumer loans. As a result, the ratio of the allowance for consumer loan losses to consumer loans held for investment increased from 0.68% at December 31, 2002 to 0.75% at December 31, 2003. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category. This allocation does not necessarily prevent the Company from shifting the allowance for loan losses between categories to better align the allowance for loan losses with the actual performance of the portfolio (dollars in thousands): Consumer(1) Real Estate and Home Equity(2) Total Allowance Allowances as % ofconsumer loans held for investment Allowance Allowances as % ofreal estate loans held for investment Allowance Allowances as % oftotal loans held for investment December 31, 2003 $ 32,185 0.75 % $ 5,662 0.15 % $ 37,847 0.46 % December 31, 2002 $ 23,472 0.68 % $ 4,194 0.21 % $ 27,666 0.50 % (1) Primarily RV, automobile, marine and credit card loans. (2) Primarily one to four family mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. The increase in the allowance for loan losses allocated to real estate loans at December 31, 2003 was due, in part to the increase in the balance of real estate loans held for investment during 2003. The allowance allocated to real estate loans at December 31, 2002, reflects managements assumption that losses within that portfolio would increase as the portfolio aged, as well as managements expectation of higher losses based on an overall weaker economic outlook and indications of potential weakness in real estate values. During 2003, indications of economic improvement and stability in the real estate market contributed to adjustments in managements estimates regarding probable losses inherent in the Banks real estate loan portfolio. Provision for loan losses was $38.5 million for 2003, $14.7 million for 2002 and $7.5 million for 2001. As part of the previously described asset diversification strategy, which included the acquisition of E*TRADE Consumer Finance and the acquisition of credit card receivables during the second and third quarters of 2003, provision for loan losses for consumer loans at December 31, 2003 was 189% higher than the prior year. The Companys provision for consumer loans consist primarily of loans secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles and marine assets which generally have higher delinquencies and charge offs than mortgages. The increase in the level of consumer loans drove a corresponding net increase in provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2003. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million reduction in the provision for loan losses related to our sale of substantially all of our keyboard loans during the third quarter of 2003. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have historically met our liquidity needs primarily through investing and financing activities, consisting principally of equity and debt offerings, increases in core deposit accounts, other borrowings and sales of loans or securities. We believe that we will be able to renew or replace our funding sources at prevailing market rates, which may be higher or lower than current rates, as well as to supplement these funding sources with cash flow from operations. We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support expansion, fund regulatory capital requirements, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies and or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. Cash Provided by Operating Activities The following table presents those significant items affecting our operating cash position for the periods indicated (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net income (loss) $ 203,027 $ (186,405 ) $ (241,532 ) Selected non cash charges: Depreciation, amortization and discount accretion 443,746 325,980 179,126 Non cash restructuring costs and other exit charges 70,811 11,880 96,793 Cumulative effect of accounting change 293,669 Net effect of changes in brokerage related assets and liabilities (103,595 ) 102,996 325,369 Net loans held for sale activity 710,378 2,533,052 (604,899 ) Net trading securities activity (454,905 ) (354,565 ) 128,705 Other assets 75,329 (325,223 ) 48,503 Total other net activity* (257,442 ) (175,183 ) (157,583 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 687,349 $ 2,226,201 $ (225,518 ) * Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further detail included in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. During 2003, cash provided from operating activities decreased primarily due to decreased cash flow in loans held for sale and trading activities. Offsetting these decreases were sales of our shares in SBI, generating approximately $122.2 million in gains. During 2002, cash provided from operating activities increased from 2001 primarily due to an increase in loans held for sale activity. This increase reflects the decision to reclassify $2.7 billion in loans held for investment to loans held for sale and the subsequent sale of these loans to fund the purchase of a more diverse portfolio of loans, including consumer loans, and the acquisition of E*TRADE Consumer Finance. When considered in conjunction with additional cash provided through financing activities of $3.3 billion, available cash resources in 2002 related to our bank activities were used to finance investing activities, which included net purchases of mortgage backed and investment securities totaling $3.5 billion and the purchase of E*TRADE Consumer Finance for $1.9 billion. Equity and Debt Offerings and Retirements In 2003, our Board of Directors approved a $100.0 million repurchase program. The open ended plan provides the flexibility to buy back common stock and retire debt or a combination of both. At December 31, 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2003, no common stock had been repurchased, and no debt had been retired under the plan. As of February 27, 2004, the Company had not retired any debt, but had repurchased 1.8 million shares for an aggregate amount of $25.1 million under this plan. In 2001 and 2002, we repurchased and retired 47.7 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $282.6 million. In addition, we retired an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock, valued at $28.8 million, in connection with the satisfaction of shareholders notes receivable. Except for 7.0 million shares repurchased in 2001, these shares were repurchased under a multi year stock buyback program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2001. In 2000 and 2001, we completed private offerings of $975.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in February 2007 and May 2008. The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into approximately 45.4 million shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from $10.925 to $23.60 per share. The notes bear interest at 6.00% and 6.75%, payable semiannually, and are non callable for three years and may then be called by us at a premium, which declines over time. The holders have the right to require redemption at a premium in the event of a change in control or other defined redemption event. The net proceeds from these debt offerings were used to repurchase common shares, to pay the outstanding balance on a $150.0 million line of credit and to fund merger and acquisition activity during 2001, and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs. In 2002, we retired $64.9 million of the 6.00% notes in exchange for 6.5 million shares of our common stock. In 2001, we retired $214.8 million of these notes in exchange for 19.2 million shares of our common stock and $15.3 million in cash. See Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Sources of Liquidity At December 31, 2003, we had financing facilities totaling $325.0 million to meet the needs of E*TRADE Clearing. These facilities, if used, would be collateralized by customer securities. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2003 and $5.5 million was outstanding at December 31, 2002, under these lines. At December 31, 2003, we also had a total of $17.2 million of loans outstanding, collateralized by equipment owned by us, as well as $0.9 million of capital leases outstanding, which we used to finance fixed assets purchases. In addition, we have numerous agreements with other broker dealers to provide financing under our stock loan program. In our banking operations, we seek to maintain a stable funding source for future periods in part by attracting core deposit accounts, which are accounts that tend to be relatively stable even in a changing interest rate environment. Typically, time deposit accounts, transactional accounts and accounts that maintain a relatively high balance provide a relatively stable source of funding. In 2003, we began sweeping Brokerage customer money market fund balances to the Bank, which were previously held in money market funds not on our balance sheets. At December 31, 2003, our average retail banking deposit account balance was approximately $21,877 and our banking customers maintained an average of 1.56 accounts. Savings and transactional deposits increased from $4.3 billion at December 31, 2002 to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of 110%. Retail certificates of deposit decreased from $3.7 billion at December 31, 2002 to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2003, or 13%. Brokered certificates of deposit decreased from $0.4 billion at December 31, 2002 to $0.3 billion at December 31, 2003, or 27%. We also rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to provide liquidity for the Bank. Total banking related borrowings decreased 10% from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002 to $6.5 billion at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, the Bank had approximately $5.2 billion in additional borrowing capacity. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Due in Thereafter Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 General obligations: Convertible subordinated notes(1) $ 44,157 $ 44,157 $ 44,157 $ 403,377 $ 335,969 $ $ 871,817 Operating lease payments 26,823 22,446 21,802 20,581 19,951 46,929 158,532 Purchase commitments(2) 25,500 25,500 Venture capital funding commitments(3) 11,970 10,000 10,000 6,755 38,725 Facilities offered for sublease, less estimated future sublease income(4) 11,999 8,390 5,033 4,945 4,444 6,467 41,278 Capital lease payments 774 163 937 Other commitments(5) 1,500 680 2,180 Total general obligations 122,723 85,836 80,992 435,658 360,364 53,396 1,138,969 Banking obligations: Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities(1) 11,757 11,891 11,891 11,891 11,891 266,539 325,860 Certificates of deposit(6)(7) 2,501,404 825,041 269,042 193,793 99,029 14,631 3,902,940 Other borrowings by bank subsidiary(7) 5,855,939 321,588 107,423 52,612 201,665 6,539,227 Loan commitments: Originate loans(8) 767,962 767,962 Purchase loans 236,656 236,656 Sell mortgages (303,711 ) (303,711 ) Security commitments: Purchase securities 2,054,016 2,054,016 Sell securities (3,013,853 ) (3,013,853 ) Total banking obligations 8,110,170 1,158,520 388,356 258,296 110,920 482,835 10,509,097 Total contractual obligations $ 8,232,893 $ 1,244,356 $ 469,348 $ 693,954 $ 471,284 $ 536,231 $ 11,648,066 (1) Includes annual interest or dividend payments; does not assume early redemption under current call provisions. (2) Commitments to purchase property and equipment. (3) Estimated based on investment plans of the venture capital funds. (4) Included in the facilities restructuring accrual. (5) Remaining payments for our acquisition of Trading Relationships.

(7) Includes annual interest based on the contractual features of each transaction, using market rates at December 31, 2003. Interest rates were assumed to remain flat over the life of all adjustable rate instruments. (8) Contains optional commitment to originate. At December 31, 2003, the Bank also had commitments of $1.0 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under HELOCs and $1.3 billion of unused credit card lines. Since these lines may be used at the customers discretion, there are no scheduled maturities or payments. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to the Nature of the Financial Services Business Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources We face direct competition from retail and institutional financial service companies in each of our lines of business. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than we do and offer a wider range of financial products and services. Many also have greater name recognition, greater market acceptance and larger customer bases. These competitors may conduct extensive promotional activities and offer better terms, lower prices and or different products and services to customers than we do. Moreover, some of our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services. This means that our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand changing market conditions better than we can. Downturns or disruptions in the securities markets could reduce transaction volumes and margin borrowing and increase our dependence on our more active customers who receive lower prices A significant portion of our revenues in recent years has been from online investing services, and although we continue to diversify our revenue sources, we expect this business to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Like other financial services firms, we are affected directly by national and global economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, disruptions to the securities markets and changes in volume and price levels of securities and futures transactions. A significant downturn in the U.S. securities markets commenced in March of 2000, resulting in industry wide declines in transaction volume. While volumes recently have begun to increase, any decrease in transaction volume may be more significant for us with respect to our less active customers, increasing our dependence on our more active and professional trading customers who receive more favorable pricing based on their transaction volume. Decreases in volumes, as well as securities prices, are also typically associated with a decrease in margin borrowing. Because we generate revenue from interest charged on margin borrowing, such decreases result in a reduction of revenue to E*TRADE Clearing. When transaction volume is low, our operating results are harmed in part because some of our overhead costs remain relatively fixed. Downturns in the securities markets increase the credit risk associated with margin lending or stock loan transactions We permit customers to purchase securities on margin. When the market declines rapidly, there is an increased risk that the value of the collateral we hold in connection with these transactions could fall below the amount of a customers indebtedness. Similarly, as part of our broker dealer operations, we frequently enter into arrangements with other broker dealers for the lending of various securities. Under regulatory guidelines, when we borrow or lend securities, we must generally simultaneously disburse or receive cash deposits. We may risk losses if there are sharp changes in market values of many securities and the counterparties to the borrowing and lending transactions fail to honor their commitments. Any downturn in public equity markets may lead to a greater risk that parties to stock lending transactions may fail to meet their commitments. We may be unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates and the interest bearing assets in our portfolio The results of operations for the Bank depend in large part upon its level of net interest income, that is, the difference between interest income from interest earning assets (such as loans and mortgage backed and other asset backed securities) and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). The Bank has derivatives to help manage its interest rate risk. However, derivatives utilized may not be entirely effective and changes in market interest rates and the yield curve could reduce the value of the Banks financial assets and reduce net interest income. Many factors affect interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Banks diversification of its asset portfolio may increase the level of charge offs As the Bank diversifies its asset portfolio through purchases and originations of higher yielding asset classes, such as automobile, marine and recreational vehicle loans and credit card portfolios, we will have to manage assets that carry a higher risk of default than our mortgage portfolio. Consequently, the level of charge offs associated with these assets may be higher than previously experienced. In addition, if the overall economy weakens, we could experience higher levels of charge offs. If expectations of future charge offs increase, a corresponding increase in the amount of our loan loss allowance would be required. The increased level of provision for loan losses recorded to meet additional loan loss allowance requirements could adversely affect our financial results if those higher yields do not cover the provision for loan losses. An increase in our delinquency rate could adversely affect our results of operations Our underwriting criteria or collection methods may not afford adequate protection against the risks inherent in the loans comprising our consumer loan portfolio. In the event of a default, the collateral value of the financed item may not cover the outstanding loan balance and costs of recovery. In the event our portfolio of consumer finance receivables experience higher delinquencies, foreclosures, repossessions or losses than anticipated, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. We are exposed to risk in our credit card portfolio In 2003, the Bank acquired credit card loans to further diversify its loan portfolio. Like other credit card lenders, we face the risk that we will not be able to collect on credit card accounts because accountholders may not repay their unsecured credit card loans. Consumers who miss payments on their credit cards often fail to repay them, and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their credit card obligations. Therefore, the rate of missed payments, or delinquencies on our credit card portfolio and the rate at which consumers may be expected to file for bankruptcy can be used to predict the future rate at which we will charge off our credit card loans. Risks associated with principal trading transactions could result in trading losses A majority of our specialist and market making revenues at Dempsey are derived from trading by Dempsey as a principal. Dempsey may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of securities for its own account, as well as trading losses in its specialist stocks and market maker stocks. From time to time, Dempsey may have large positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry. Dempsey also operates a proprietary trading desk separately from its specialist and market maker operations, which may also incur trading losses. Certain portions of our E*TRADE Professional business are also involved in proprietary trading, in which the firm provides capital that becomes traded by employees and others. Similar to Dempseys business, the proprietary trading positions of E*TRADE Professional may also incur trading losses. Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers and or specialists could harm our specialist and market maker business The increase in computer generated buy/sell programs in the marketplace has continued to tighten spreads, resulting in reduced revenue capture per share by the specialist market making community and reduced payment for order flow revenues for us. Similarly, a reduction in the volume and or volatility of trading activity could also reduce spreads that specialists and market makers receive, also adversely affecting revenues generated by Dempsey. Alternative trading systems that have developed over the past few years could also reduce the levels of trading of exchange listed securities through specialists and the levels of over the counter trading through market makers. In addition, electronic communication networks have emerged as an alternative forum to which broker 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements dealers and institutional investors can direct their limit orders. This allows broker dealers and institutional investors to avoid directing their trades through market makers. As a result, Dempsey may experience a reduction in its flow of limit orders. If we do not successfully manage consolidation opportunities, we could be at a competitive disadvantage There has been significant consolidation in the online financial services industry over the last several years, and the consolidation is likely to continue in the future. Should we fail to take advantage of viable consolidation opportunities or if we overextend our efforts by acquiring businesses that we are unable to integrate or manage properly, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Acquisitions entail numerous risks including retaining or hiring skilled personnel, integrating acquired operations, products and personnel and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on any acquisition or that future acquisitions will not be dilutive to earnings. We rely heavily on technology to deliver products and services Disruptions to or instability of our technology, including an actual or perceived breach of the security of our technology, could harm our business and our reputation. Our international efforts subject us to additional risks and regulation, which could impair our business growth One component of our strategy has been an effort to build an international business. We have established certain joint venture and or licensee relationships. We have limited control over the management and direction of these venture partners and or licensees, and their action or inaction, including their failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and or corporate governance, could harm our operations and or our reputation. Risks Relating to the Regulation of our Business We are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation. All of our broker dealer subsidiaries have to comply with many laws and rules, including rules relating to possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending and execution and settlement of transactions. We are also subject to additional laws and rules as a result of our specialist and market maker operations in Dempsey. In addition, to the extent that, now or in the future, we solicit orders from our customers or make investment recommendations (or are deemed to have done so), or offer products and services, such as investing in futures, that are not suitable for all investors, we would become subject to additional rules and regulations governing, among other things, sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to customers. Similarly, E*TRADE Financial Corporation, E*TRADE Re, LLC and ETBH, as savings and loan holding companies, and E*TRADE Bank, as a Federally chartered savings bank, are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS, and, in the case of the Bank, the FDIC. Such regulation covers all banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, recordkeeping, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel. If we fail to comply with applicable securities, banking and insurance laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business The SEC, NYSE, NASD, Commodity Futures Trading Commission or other self regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can, among other things, censure, fine, issue cease and desist orders or suspend 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees. The OTS may take similar action with respect to our banking activities. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state could bring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws. The ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is dependent in part on the establishment, maintenance and enforcement of an effective compliance system. The failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions. If we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulators, we may be fined or even forced out of business The SEC, NYSE, NASD, OTS and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and regulatory capital by banks. Net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets. Failure to maintain the required net capital could result in suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by the NYSE and or NASD, and could ultimately lead to the firms liquidation. In the past, our broker dealer subsidiaries have depended largely on capital contributions by us in order to comply with net capital requirements. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require an intensive use of capital could be limited. Such operations may include investing activities, marketing and the financing of customer account balances. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from brokerage subsidiaries could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock. See Note 23 of Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for the minimum net capital requirements for our domestic broker dealer subsidiaries for the current reporting period. Similarly, the Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OTS. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could harm a banks operations and financial statements. A bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of a banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the strength of components of its capital, risk weightings of assets, off balance sheet transactions and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require a bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets. To satisfy the capital requirements for a well capitalized financial institution, a bank must maintain minimum Total and Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets ratios. See Note 23 of Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for the Bank for the current reporting period. As a non grandfathered savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulations that could restrict our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities We are required to file periodic reports with the OTS and are subject to examination by the OTS. The OTS also has certain types of enforcement powers over the Company, ETBH and E*TRADE Re, LLC, including the ability to issue cease and desist orders, force divestiture of the Bank and impose civil and monetary penalties for violations of Federal banking laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, our activities are restricted to those that are financial in nature and certain real estate related activities. We may make merchant banking investments in companies whose activities are not financial in nature if those investments are made for the purpose of appreciation and ultimate resale of the investment and we do not manage or operate the company. Such merchant banking investments may be subject to maximum holding periods and special recordkeeping and risk management requirements. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We believe all of our existing activities and investments are permissible under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, but the OTS has not yet fully interpreted these provisions. Even if our existing activities and investments are permissible, we are unable to pursue future activities that are not financial in nature. We are also limited in our ability to invest in other savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation of its activities and investments, capitalization, community reinvestment, risk management policies and procedures and relationship with affiliated companies. Acquisitions of and mergers with other financial institutions, purchases of deposits and loan portfolios, the establishment of new Bank subsidiaries and the commencement of new activities by Bank subsidiaries require the prior approval of the OTS, and in some cases the FDIC, which may deny approval or limit the scope of our planned activity. These regulations and conditions could place us at a competitive disadvantage in an environment in which consolidation within the financial services industry is prevalent. Also, these regulations and conditions could affect our ability to realize synergies from future acquisitions, could negatively affect us following the acquisition and could also delay or prevent the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services. Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock We have incurred losses in the past and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable We have incurred operating losses in prior periods and we may do so in the future. We reported net income of $203.0 million in 2003, which includes $134.6 million of pre tax restructuring and other exit charges; net losses of $186.4 million in 2002, which includes a cumulative effect of accounting change of $293.7 million; and net losses of $241.5 million in 2001, which includes pre tax facility restructuring and other exit charges of $202.8 million. Our ratio of debt to equity may make it more difficult to make payments on our debts or to obtain financing At December 31, 2003, we had an outstanding balance of $695.3 million in convertible subordinated notes. Our ratio of debt (our convertible debt, capital lease obligations and term loans) to equity (expressed as a percentage) was 47.7% at December 31, 2003. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it more difficult to make payments on our debt; make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile From January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003, the price per share of our common stock has ranged from a high of $12.91 to a low of $2.81. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In the past, volatility in the market price of a companys securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key employees, reduce our access to capital and otherwise harm our business. We may need additional funds in the future, which may not be available and which may result in dilution of the value of our common stock In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our business growth plans. In 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements addition, if funds are available, the issuance of securities could dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall. We have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a shareholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include: authorization for the issuance of blank check preferred stock; provision for a classified Board of Directors with staggered, three year terms; the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors; a super majority voting requirement to effect business combinations or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; limits on the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; and advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings. Attempts to acquire control of E*TRADE may also be delayed or prevented by our stockholder rights plan, which is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to protect shareholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of E*TRADE that do not offer an adequate price to all shareholders or are otherwise not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. In addition, certain provisions of our stock incentive plans, management retention and employment agreements (including severance payments and stock option acceleration), and Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, we have evaluated such risks for our Brokerage and Banking Segments separately. The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors. BROKERAGE OPERATIONS Our Brokerage operations are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk. Interest Rate Sensitivity At December 31, 2003, we had variable rate brokerage and corporate term loans outstanding of approximately $17.2 million and $23.7 million at December 31, 2002. The monthly interest payments on these term loans are subject to interest rate risk. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 1% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, the interest payments would increase by an immaterial amount. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consists of brokerage and investment services outside of the United States. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected by factors, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide our services. We are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates on the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based revenues decreases. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated operating margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. To mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on our non U.S. dollar based revenues and operating expenses, we evaluate the costs and benefits to hedging our material net non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts. Currently, hedges of transactions are immaterial. Given the short term nature of our foreign exchange forward contracts, our exposure to risk associated with currency market movement on the instruments is not material. Financial Instruments For our working capital and reserves, which are required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations, we primarily invest in money market funds, resale agreements, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Money market funds do not have maturity dates and do not present a material market risk. The other financial instruments are fixed rate investments with short maturities and do not present a material interest rate risk. Equity Security Price Risk We currently hold an investment in SBI which is a Japanese yen denominated publicly traded equity security with unrealized gains of $178.4 million as of December 31, 2003. As the securitys market price and yen fluctuates, we are exposed to a loss of some of the unrealized gains. We also held security positions related to our market making business of $11.4 million and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. If market prices fluctuate, we are exposed to a loss on some of these balances. BANKING OPERATIONS Our banking operations acquire and manage interest bearing assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. Interest bearing instruments include investment securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and derivative financial instruments. These instruments are subject to changes in market value as interest rates change. Interest Rate Risk The acquisition, maintenance and disposition of assets and liabilities are critical elements of the Banks operations. Throughout the process, these instruments are subject to interest rate risk, which is the potential for adverse declines in market values. Numerous factors may influence the speed and direction of market value changes including, but not limited to, liquidity, absolute interest rate levels, shape of the yield curve and implied volatility of future interest rate movements. The net market values of bank instruments may directly or indirectly impact the Banks current or future earnings and are subject to certain regulatory constraints. Market risk management oversight is the responsibility of the Banks Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). The ALCO is responsible for measuring, managing and reporting the Banks aggregate market risk within established policy guidelines and limits, which are reviewed periodically. The Bank maintains a Risk Management Group, independent of the Banks portfolio management functions, to assist the ALCO in measuring and managing market risk. The Banks exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution of all interest sensitive assets, liabilities and derivatives. These items have differing risk characteristics that, if properly managed, can mitigate the Banks exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. At December 31, 2003, approximately 52.3% of the market value of the Banks total assets was comprised of residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. The Banks 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements liability structure consists primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as money market accounts, shorter term certificates of deposit and wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities. The derivative portfolio of the Bank is positioned to decrease the overall market risk resulting from the combination of assets and liabilities. The Banks market risk is discussed and quantified in more detail in the Scenario Analysis section below. Most of the Banks assets are generally classified as non trading portfolios and, as such, are not marked to market through earnings for accounting purposes. The Bank did maintain a trading portfolio of investment grade securities throughout 2002 and 2003. The fair value of the trading portfolio was $821 million and $392 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the Net Present Value of Equity (NPVE) approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and then combined to produce a NPVE figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up 100, 200 and 300 basis points and down 100 basis points. The down 200 and 300 basis point scenarios are not presented at December 31, 2003 and 2002, because they result in negative interest rates. The sensitivity of NPVE at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the limits established by the Banks Board of Directors are listed below (dollars in thousands): Change in Net Present Value of Equity At December 31, Board Limit Parallel Change in Interest Rates (bps) 2003 2002 +300 $ (278,901 ) (26)% $ (240,693 ) (29)% (55 )% +200 $ (175,696 ) (16)% $ (149,554 ) (18)% (30 )% +100 $ (76,145 ) (7)% $ (57,255 ) (7)% (15 )% 100 $ 18,418 2% $ (19,354 ) (2)% (15 )% Under criteria published by the OTS, the Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at December 31, 2003 is characterized as minimal. Derivative Financial Instruments The Bank uses derivative financial instruments to help manage its interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps are used to lower the duration of specific fixed rate assets or increase the duration of specific adjustable rate liabilities. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the Banks mortgage portfolios, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options the Bank employs are primarily Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates, while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates. Mortgage Production Activities In the production of mortgage products, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk between the commitment and funding dates of the loans. There were $0.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002, in mortgage loan commitments awaiting funding. The associated interest rate risk results when the Bank enters into Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs), whereby determination of loan interest rates occurs prior to funding. When the intent is to sell originated loans, the associated IRLCs are considered derivatives and, accordingly, are recorded at fair value with associated changes recorded in earnings. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
