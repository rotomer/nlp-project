ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. OVERVIEW We focus our business on utilizing technology to deliver financial solutions primarily to the self directed investor built upon price/rate, functionality and service. In 2004, we concentrated our efforts on integrating our product offerings and business operations creating operational efficiencies, all contributing to the strength of our financial performance. As a result, in 2004, we reported earnings growth of over 70% on net income from continuing operations of $350 million. For the first time in our history total client assets exceeded $100 billion. We face numerous challenges in the financial services industry, which is characterized by increasingly rapid change, evolving customer demands and intense competition. Some of the broader trends within the financial services industry that directly impact our business include: Continued competitive pricing pressure on trading commissions within certain customer segments and on consumer loan originations; Continued margin compression and low market volatility within market making; Continued market uncertainty and macroeconomic factors that could result in volatility in market volumes and trading activity; and Changes in interest rates and continued pressure on the spread between the interest we earn on interest earning banking assets and that which we pay on interest bearing banking liabilities. Our financial results are presented as two segments, brokerage and banking, which have different characteristics. The brokerage segment generates revenues primarily from customer trading, market making activities, proprietary trading, margin lending and brokerage related fees. The banking segment generates revenues primarily from its diversified interest earning assets (banking assets held which earn interest income), gains on sales of loans and banking related service charges and fees from asset management. During 2004, exclusive of intersegment revenues, the brokerage segment generated approximately 60% and the banking segment generated 40% of the Companys consolidated net revenues. In 2005, we realigned our organizational structure and operations around our retail and institutional customers. For retail, the realignment will integrate the management and operations of our brokerage, banking and lending businesses, focusing on delivering integrated product and service offerings to the retail customer. For institutional, the realignment will integrate the management and operations of balance sheet management, market making and institutional sales trading, focusing on creating a more significant capital markets business that will leverage our retail customer base. We believe that the organizational realignment will help us to better execute on our vision. We have and will continue to seek opportunities to: Deepen customer relationships by rewarding the retail customer for depth of the overall relationship with enhanced functionality. In February 2005 we introduced E*TRADE Complete, an integrated financial services solution that will enable our customers to manage all their trading, investing, banking and borrowing relationships in a consolidated manner. We expect this product to further differentiate us from our competitors, attract and retain more of our retail customers assets and result in utilizing more of our financial solutions. Integrate our technology and service operations. In September 2004 we converted from multiple processing and clearing systems to ADP Services, creating a scalable and cost efficient single platform. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements E*TRADE Complete is intended to leverage technology to help customers optimize cash and credit by utilizing tools designed to inform them of whether or not they are receiving the most appropriate rates for their cash and paying the most appropriate rates for credit. Enhance our products to make them more compelling to our customers by offering an attractive combination of price, service and functionality. In 2004 we paid out approximately $1.8 million through our 12b 1 rebate program, offered the lowest cost index funds and offered no fee IRAs. In February 2005 we announced a refined customer segmentation model that included new pricing, lowered segment qualification criteria and service enhancements for our three primary retail customer segments. The Company intends to increase marketing spend in 2005, targeting certain customer segments. For these customer segments, the marketing will be focused on increasing customer usage and aggregating customer assets by communicating trading, investing, banking and lending integrated solutions that meet the needs of our retail customers. Our financial performance has enabled us to generate significant operating cash flows and as a result, our Board of Directors determined that using a portion of our cash to reduce outstanding debt and outstanding common stock will likely create long term value for the Companys shareholders and consequently approved three separate repurchase programs totaling $500 million over the past two years. Through these programs, we have reduced the amount of our long term debt and repurchased a portion of our outstanding common stock. For example, we reduced our long term debt from $695.3 million at December 31, 2003 to $585.6 million at December 31, 2004, and repurchased 13.7 million shares of our common stock in 2004. These activities have helped us lower our debt to equity ratio and increase our earnings per share. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $238.0 million available under these authorized plans to purchase additional shares of common stock or retire additional debt. We will continue to strengthen our financial position by deploying cash to grow our business, retire debt, repurchase shares and explore other strategic opportunities. Further Discussion The remainder of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows: Results of Operations provides insight into the reasons that the financial performance of our Company changed during the past three years; Liquidity and Capital Resources describes how we obtained and used cash to operate the business; Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates describes key accounting policies and estimates that are critical to the way we measure and report on our financial performance; and Risk Factors describe the risks, obstacles and challenges that we face that could adversely affect our future operations and financial performance. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS During 2004, our net income was $380.5 million compared to $203.0 million in 2003. The increase in net income from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to: an increase in our brokerage and banking revenues, see Analysis of Brokerage and Banking Revenues; a decrease in expenses excluding interest, most significant of which, was the decrease in facility restructuring and other exit charges, see Expenses Excluding Interest; a decrease in the amount of gains on sales of our investment in Softbank Investment Corporation (SBI), offset by losses that resulted from the early retirement of our subordinated convertible notes, see Other Income (Loss); and an increase in net gain on disposal of discontinued operations, see Discontinued Operations. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues Key Revenue Drivers The key revenue drivers that we use to measure and explain the results of our operations are presented in the following table: Revenue Type Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) Brokerage 129,285 119,260 87,464 8 % 36 % Average commission per revenue trade Brokerage $ 10.75 $ 11.32 $ 13.48 (5 )% (16 )% Average margin balances (in millions) Brokerage $ 2,060 $ 1,225 $ 1,250 68 % (2 )% Average net interest spread (basis points) Banking 207 150 146 38 % 3 % Average interest earning assets (in millions) Banking $ 22,332 $ 17,165 $ 13,704 30 % 25 % Brokerage Revenues The brokerage segment earns a majority of its revenues from commissions and brokerage interest income from margin lending. Commissions and brokerage interest income together represented 57% of total brokerage revenues in 2004 and 55% in 2003 and 2002. Our brokerage revenues are largely dependent on the number of DARTs that we process, which is in turn dependent on overall trading volumes in the securities markets. DARTs have increased over the past three years as a result of a resurgence in market activity from the lows experienced in 2001. Improvement in DARTs, partially offset by reductions in average commission per revenue trade, drove our commission revenues up over the past three years. Our average commission per revenue trade is based on the mix of trades between 1) Active Traders, Serious Investors and Main Street Investors; 2) domestic and international; and 3) retail and professional trading activities. Average commission per revenue trade has declined due to lower pricing offered to retail customers. Although these pricing reductions have decreased the average commission per revenue trade, they have contributed to improving overall volume, which in turn, improve DARTs and commission revenues. Our brokerage interest income is driven largely from the level of margin balances our customers hold. Historically these balances have increased with increases in trading activity and or higher equity volumes in the overall securities markets. Average margin debt increased 68% from 2003 to 2004, improving brokerage interest income. Brokerage interest income decreased from 2002 to 2003 driven largely by reduced average margin balances and declining rates. Banking Revenues The banking segment earns a significant amount of its revenues from interest earned on its diversified interest earning assets (assets held by the banking segment which earn interest income). Net banking interest income, net of provision for loan losses, represented 73%, 42% and 48% of total banking revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 increase in net banking interest income as a percentage of total banking revenue, resulted primarily from the combination of increased net interest spread and higher average interest earning assets and a reduction of gains on the sale of loans and securities. Factors that affect net interest spread include the volume, price, mix and maturity of interest earning assets; the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; market rate and yield curve fluctuations; and asset quality. In addition, interest expense is principally affected by our mix of interest bearing liabilities, the interest rates we pay on these liabilities and the relative proportions of lower cost funds such as our SDA product to other higher cost funds. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Net interest spread increased to 207 basis points in 2004 from 150 basis points in 2003 and 146 basis points in 2002. The increase in net interest spread is primarily due to lower cost of funds. During 2004, our cost of funds were reduced by our sweeping brokerage customer funds and free credits to the SDA, offering customers a competitive interest rate and, at the same time, reducing certain of our higher rate funds, such as certificates of deposit. The SDA balance has grown to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2004 from $4.3 billion at December 31, 2003. Average interest earning assets increased in 2004 and 2003 by 30% and 25%, respectively, from the prior comparable years. Our level of average interest earning assets depends on the relative volumes of our purchases and sales of mortgage backed securities, available for sale securities and home equity line of credit (HELOC) portfolios. Expenses Excluding Interest Total expenses excluding interest decreased 13% to $1.1 billion in 2004 from $1.2 billion in 2003. This decrease was primarily a result of our 2003 restructuring plan (the 2003 Restructuring Plan) for which we recorded a charge of $112.6 million in 2003. The 2003 Restructuring Plan, initiated in mid 2003, was focused on creating additional operating leverage by exiting unprofitable product offerings and consolidating operations that included: closure of the E*TRADE FINANCIAL Center in New York. This Center encompassed approximately 31,000 square feet, was used by customers to access the Companys products and services and served as an introduction point for new customers to the Companys products and services. Although we continue to operate Centers to provide our retail customers personal access to our team of licensed relationship specialists, we have done so on a significantly reduced scale at a significantly reduced operating cost. Our current Centers are approximately 4,000 square feet, with annual operating costs of approximately $0.4 million; closure of 43 E*TRADE FINANCIAL Target Zones. We terminated the Zones in Target stores, in part because they were unprofitable and we have focused on other methods of reaching our current and potential customers in a more efficient manner; consolidation within our Menlo Park and Rancho Cordova, California facilities. These facilities were used for corporate and administrative functions and were exited as the we consolidated our employees into nearby offices and moved certain functions to our offices in Virginia; and elimination of unprofitable products that included such offerings as stock baskets and electronic advisory services. In 2004, we recognized further benefits of the 2003 Restructuring Plan, as costs, such as, occupancy and equipment and depreciation and amortization decreased as compared to 2003. These decreases were offset by increases in commissions, clearance and floor brokerage that resulted from an increase in our executed trades as market activity increased and an increase in professional services that resulted from our back office conversion from BETA Systems to ADP Services and compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Compensation and benefits include employee salary, bonus, sales and trading commissions, temporary employee services and other related benefit costs. Over the past three years, compensation and benefits have remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues. Of the components, employee bonus is the most variable as the amounts are based on certain employee and Company targets being met. We have accrued for employee and officer bonuses, which are paid out in the first quarter of the following year, in amounts of approximately $62.0 million for 2004, $61.4 million for 2003 and $15.7 million for 2002. Of these, amounts to executive officers represented $15.6 million for 2004, $14.1 million for 2003 and $4.0 million for 2002. Advertising and market development include production and placement of advertisements on television and in print, direct mail marketing and promotions, website advertising and advertising agency fees. Advertising and market development increased approximately 8% to $65.7 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily as a result of increased advertising spend during the fourth quarter of 2004. The amount spent on advertising is a function of 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements both market opportunity and our belief that advertising and direct marketing help increase targeted customer acquisition and assets. For 2005, we expect to spend approximately $60 million more than we spent in 2004 for advertising and market development, unless market conditions significantly change from our expectations. Professional services include legal, accounting and tax and technology and other consulting service fees. Professional services increased approximately 23% to $70.8 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase was due to additional costs associated with our Sarbanes Oxley compliance, back office conversion from BETA Systems to ADP Services and other projects initiated during the year. Facility restructuring and other exit charges, which reflect expenses associated with facility consolidation, exit or write off of unprofitable product lines and early termination of contracts, were $16.2 million in 2004, $134.2 million in 2003 and $15.4 million in 2002. The charges for 2003 resulted from the 2003 Restructuring Plan of $112.6 million, recognition of additional facility restructuring expense of $16.4 million, resulting from updated estimates of sublease income and a delay in sublease start dates anticipated in our 2001 Restructuring Plan and $5.3 million related to other exit activity. The charges in 2004 relate to updated estimates of sublease income and a delay in sublease start dates anticipated in our 2003 Restructuring Plan and additional charges due to resolution of a legal matter involving the Companys exit activity from its Israeli joint venture of $14.5 million. Other expenses include insurance, travel and related business expenditures, regulatory fees and claims and settlements. Other expenses decreased approximately 9% in 2004, as compared to 2003. The decrease is primarily due to non recurring litigation settlements that occurred in 2003 of approximately $14 million. Of this amount, $7 million was attributable to a case in the brokerage segment and $7.2 million was attributable to a case in the banking segment. Other Income (Loss) Gain (loss) on sale and impairment of investments decreased 13% to a gain of $128.1 million in 2004 from $148.0 million in 2003. For both periods, these gains were primarily from sales of our shares in SBI. We sold shares of SBI resulting in a gains of $130.6 million and $151.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $23.0 million in 2004 and none in 2003. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was primarily the result of our early redemptions of our 6.00% and 6.75% convertible subordinated notes for cash. The loss recognized is attributed to the premium paid on redemption in accordance with the redemption of the notes and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $19.4 million. In addition, we paid down $50 million in FHLB advances, resulting in an early termination fee of approximately $2.4 million and an early call of a $24.2 million Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debenture, resulting in a $1.1 million loss recorded as loss on early extinguishment of debt for the remaining unamortized discount and issuance costs incurred when the debenture was originally issued. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Our effective income tax rate was approximately 32% and 36% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The reduction in our 2004 tax rate was principally the result of two items. First, during 2004 the Company reached a favorable tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. This agreement resolved various issues for all federal tax liabilities through 2000, including most notably certain research and development credit claims. As a result of the settlement, reductions in income tax expense of $22.4 million were recorded. In addition, we recognized a $12.2 million tax benefit from our excess tax basis in a partnership interest that was sold during 2004. Discontinued Operations In 2004, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of E*TRADE Access for $107.0 million in cash. The sale resulted in a $57.5 million pre tax gain ($31.4 million, net of taxes). We have also reflected E*TRADE Access results of operations as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements, which were relatively consistent over the past three years. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Analysis of Brokerage and Banking Revenues Brokerage Revenues Brokerage revenues contributed approximately 60% of our net revenues in 2004. Brokerage revenues increased 5% to $924.2 million in 2004 and 2% to $879.1 million in 2003 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were largely due to increased commissions and principal transactions and increased brokerage interest income in 2004. The following table sets forth the components of net brokerage revenues and dollar and percentage change information for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 2004 2003 2002 $ Amount % $ Amount % Brokerage revenues: Commissions $ 349,539 $ 337,468 $ 294,791 $ 12,071 4 % $ 42,677 14 % Principal transactions 252,162 229,846 223,531 22,316 10 % 6,315 3 % Other brokerage related 163,686 177,682 174,263 (13,996 ) (8 )% 3,419 2 % Brokerage interest income 177,362 144,379 182,103 32,983 23 % (37,724 ) (21 )% Brokerage interest expense (18,524 ) (10,305 ) (12,515 ) (8,219 ) (80 )% 2,210 18 % Net brokerage revenues $ 924,225 $ 879,070 $ 862,173 $ 45,155 5 % $ 16,897 2 % The following table presents key drivers and additional indicators that we consider important in measuring performance and explaining brokerage revenues: Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 2004 2003 2002 Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) 129,285 119,260 87,464 8 % 36 % Average commission per revenue trade $ 10.75 $ 11.32 $ 13.48 (5 )% (16 )% Total brokerage revenue trades(1) 32,515,292 29,814,930 21,866,047 9 % 36 % Active brokerage accounts, end of period(2) 2,956,090 2,848,625 3,690,916 4 % (23 )% Average (dollars in millions): Customer margin balances $ 2,060 $ 1,225 $ 1,250 68 % (2 )% Customer money market fund balances $ 3,286 $ 6,659 $ 7,743 (51 )% (14 )% SDA balances $ 5,009 $ 877 $ 471 % * Stock borrow balances $ 1,088 $ 366 $ 317 197 % 15 % Stock loan balances $ 1,318 $ 675 $ 441 95 % 53 % Customer credit balances $ 2,385 $ 2,134 $ 1,471 12 % 45 % (1) Total brokerage revenue trades include domestic, international and professional revenue trades. (2) We consider a brokerage account active if the account has an asset balance of at least $25 at the end of the quarter, if a trade has been made in the account in the past six months or if the account was opened in connection with a corporate employee stock benefit program. Commissions are earned when customers execute trades. The primary factors that affect our commissions are DARTs and average commission per revenue trade. The average commission per revenue trade is impacted by the mix between and within our domestic, international and professional businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base, and as a result, a change in the executed trades between these businesses impacts average commission per revenue trade. Each business has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates and as a result, changes in the mix of trade types within these businesses impact average commission per revenue trade. Our commission revenue does not include revenues from our brokerage institutional customers, which are included in 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements principal transactions. For both 2004 and 2003, commissions, which constitute the largest portion of our net brokerage revenues increased 4% and 14%, respectively, from the prior comparable year. DARTs increased in both 2003 and 2004 from the prior comparable year primarily as a result of a resurgence in market activity, which rose from the relatively low levels reached in 2001 during an industry wide drop in trading activity, our acquisition of professional traders and our customer segmentation initiatives. During the first quarter of 2004, we launched Priority E*TRADE. Priority E*TRADE targeted Serious Investors and created a third tier in our retail price structure, offering base commission rates on equity and option trades for qualified customers of $12.99 per trade from $22.99 per trade. In June 2002 we implemented a program for Active Traders, creating a second tier in our retail price structure, offering a simplified $9.99 flat base commission rate program. Also in June 2002 we completed the acquisition of E*TRADE Professional which included professional traders that generally execute trades at a higher rate than our other customer segments. With the implementations of the above mentioned retail pricing programs, average commission per revenue trade decreased in both 2004 and 2003 to $10.75 and $11.32 per trade, respectively from $13.48 in 2002. The overall decline in average commission per revenue trade came from increased volume from professional traders, reductions in the pricing offered to certain active traders, whose trades represented approximately half of retail trades and approximately one third of total trades, and a reduction in commission per revenue trade from our international trading. Increased trading by professional traders reduces our average commission per revenue trade because professional traders are generally charged lower commissions than retail customers. Of the total $0.57 decrease in average commission per revenue trade from 2003 to 2004, pricing reductions and changes in the trade mix within each of the businesses contributed the majority with a decrease of $0.67 per average revenue trade. This was partially offset by a $0.10 increase resulting from the change in the mix of trades executed between domestic, international and professional businesses. Of the total $2.16 decrease from 2002 to 2003, the full year impact of professional traders contributed $1.65, change in retail pricing contributed $0.43 and our international operations contributed the remaining $0.08. Principal transactions include revenues from institutional customers, market making revenues and net gains on proprietary trading. The Company provides institutional customers with global trading and settlement services, as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties, in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates. As such, our principal transactions revenues are influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the trading performance of our proprietary trading activities. Principal transactions increased from 2003 to 2004 due to increased market making and gains on proprietary trading, partially offset by decreased institutional trading revenues. Principal transactions increased from 2002 to 2003 due to increases in institutional trading revenues and net gains on proprietary trading, offset by decreased market making revenues. Market making revenues increased from $81 million to $91 million from 2003 to 2004 due to significantly increased volume from bulletin board stocks and to a lesser extent listed stocks, coupled with an increase in revenue capture on over the counter traded shares. Market making revenues decreased from 2002 to 2003 by $8.7 million, although overall volumes of equity shares traded were nearly 50% higher in 2003 than in 2002, as trading in bulletin board stock comprised a larger portion of the mix of securities in which we make a market. Net gains on proprietary trading increased from $24 million to $36 million from 2003 to 2004 due to increases in the number of trades, shares traded and revenue per share. Proprietary trading increased from 2002 to 2003 due to our acquisition of E*TRADE Professional in June 2002. Institutional revenues were $125 million in both 2003 and 2004 as institutional trading activity remained relatively consistent from 2003 to 2004. Institutional revenues increased from 2002 to 2003 due primarily to our acquisition of Engelman in December 2002. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The components of other brokerage related revenues and percentage change information were as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 2004 2003 2002 $ Amount % $ Amount % Other brokerage related: Account maintenance fees $ 43,345 $ 55,757 $ 66,394 $ (12,412 ) (22 )% $ (10,637 ) (16 )% Stock plan administration 23,774 24,401 25,530 (627 ) (3 )% (1,129 ) (4 )% Payments for order flow 17,397 11,356 13,992 6,041 53 % (2,636 ) (19 )% Proprietary fund revenues 11,013 18,158 9,222 (7,145 ) (39 )% 8,936 97 % FX margin revenue 9,950 7,059 3,874 2,891 41 % 3,185 82 % ECN rebate fees 8,815 12,475 6,966 (3,660 ) (29 )% 5,509 79 % Other 49,392 48,476 48,285 916 2 % 191 % Total other brokerage related $ 163,686 $ 177,682 $ 174,263 $ (13,996 ) (8 )% $ 3,419 2 % The decrease in other brokerage related revenues from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to decreases in account maintenance fees, proprietary fund revenues and electronic communication network (ECN) rebate fees, partially offset by increased payments for order flow and FX margin revenue. The increases in other brokerage related revenues from 2002 to 2003 are primarily due to increase in proprietary fund revenues, ECN rebate fees, partially offset by decreases in account maintenance fees and payments for order flow. Account maintenance fees are charged to customers accounts when they fall below specified balance and or activity levels. The decrease in account maintenance fees from 2002 to 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of accounts that were charged as customers either met the specified balance and or activity levels, closed their accounts or had their account value taken to $0 as a result of the account maintenance fee. Stock plan administration revenues result from our providing corporate customers with full service assistance and software to manage their employee stock benefit plans. The fluctuations in these revenues are a function of activity with customers, which has remained fairly constant over the past three years. The increase in payments for order flow from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the overall increase in trades and an increase in order flow received on option trades. The decrease in payments for order flow from 2002 to 2003 was partially attributable to the challenging environment that the listed market makers and specialists were operating under, which in turn, resulted in overall reductions in payments for order flow. Proprietary fund revenues represents a portion of the fees earned on customer balances held in money market funds. These revenues decreased from 2003 to 2004 due to a decrease in customer average money market fund balances as customers moved funds to our SDA product. In October 2002, the Company began managing more funds on its own versus putting its customers money in an outside managed fund receiving management fees on these funds in lieu of interest. This change was the primary reason for the increase from 2002 to 2003. FX, or foreign exchange, margin revenue has increased over the past three years primarily related to the increased activity in employee stock plans for our E*TRADE Corporate Services customers international employees. ECN rebate fees represent rebates received for providing liquidity on ECNs. Liquidity is generally added to an ECN when orders are placed outside the current bid/ask price range for a particular security. ECN rebate fees decreased from 2003 to 2004 due to a decrease in shares executed which was due to a less volatile securities market. ECN rebate fees increased from 2002 to 2003, as a result of our acquisition of E*TRADE Professional in June 2002, which generates significant ECN rebate fees. Other revenues comprise various brokerage related service charges and fees charged to brokerage customers. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Brokerage interest income refers to interest income earned on margin loans, stock borrow balances, cash required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines and fees on customer assets invested in money market funds. Brokerage interest income primarily depends on average interest rates and average balances of assets upon which we earn interest. As interest rates fluctuate, so does the average rate that we earn on these assets. The increase in brokerage interest income from 2003 to 2004 was due to significant increases in average margin and stock borrow balances, partially offset by reduced margin rates earned. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to a reduction in average margin interest rates earned, customer average money market fund balances and interest income associated replacing third party managed funds with our own. The reduction in customer average money market fund balances from 2002 to 2003 related to the sweep of customer money market fund balances into the SDA product beginning in 2003. Revenues on the balances in the SDA product are reflected in the net interest spread. In October 2002, we replaced third party managed money market funds offered to our customers with our own money market funds. As a result, a portion of the third party revenues we earned and previously recorded as brokerage interest income were subsequently recorded as proprietary fund revenues and classified as other brokerage related revenues as the revenues related to our management of the money market fund assets. In early 2005, we provided investors notice that certain of these money market funds would be terminated and certain others would be managed by a third party. Brokerage interest expense includes interest paid to customers on credit balances, interest paid to banks and interest paid to other broker dealers through our brokerage subsidiarys stock loan program. Although we pay interest on most customer credit balances, we do not pay interest on certain credit balances such as those that result from short sales. We include brokerage interest expense in net brokerage revenues because it offsets gross brokerage interest income in the computation of net revenues. As with interest income, the key determinants of interest expense are average interest rates and average balances upon which we are required to pay interest. The increase from 2003 to 2004 was due to an increase in average stock loan and customer credit balances with a slight increase in average interest rates. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 was due to a decrease in average interest rates paid, partially offset by an increase in average stock loan and customer credit balances. Banking Revenues During 2004, net banking revenues, which represent approximately 40% of the Companys net revenues, increased 8% to $603.8 million primarily because of a $203.8 million increase in net banking interest income, partially offset by a $120.9 million reduction in the gains on sales of originated loans. A 30% rise in our average balance of interest earning assets, was the primary driver of a $219.9 million increase in our banking interest income. In addition, our ability to sweep an average of $4.1 billion of additional lower cost SDA funds was a key driver in reducing interest expense and widening net interest spread by 57 basis points. Gains on sales of originated loans, which we generate when we lend money and subsequently sell the loans, decreased primarily as a result of higher interest rates which depressed the volume of mortgage refinancings made by E*TRADE Mortgage. Our banking interest income, interest expense and gain on sales of originated loans are each largely dependent upon interest rates. If interest rates rise, origination volumes, and correspondingly, our gain on the sale of originated loans, would likely decline and our net interest spread could increase. Conversely, if interest rates fall, we believe our revenues from mortgage originations will likely increase and our net interest spread could decline. At December 2004, 2003 and 2002, active banking accounts were 626,673, 638,345 and 511,298, respectively. Deposit accounts are considered active if the account was initially funded, remains open and is not abandoned or dormant under applicable Federal and State laws. Loan accounts are considered active if the Company holds the underlying obligations. Credit card accounts are active if the account has incurred a debit or credit within the prior month. The decline in customer accounts in 2004 primarily reflects a decline in retail deposit accounts, primarily higher cost certificates of deposit while the increase in 2003 reflects overall increases in banking accounts including the addition of credit card accounts. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The components of our banking net revenues and the resulting variances were as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 2004 2003 2002 $ Amount % $ Amount % Banking revenues: Banking interest income $ 968,411 $ 748,527 $ 767,587 $ 219,884 29 % $ (19,060 ) (2 )% Banking interest expense (491,931 ) (475,824 ) (548,659 ) (16,107 ) (3 )% 72,835 13 % Provision for loan losses (38,121 ) (38,523 ) (14,664 ) 402 1 % (23,859 ) * Gain on sales of originated loans 71,561 192,467 128,506 (120,906 ) (63 )% 63,961 50 % Gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net 57,853 97,261 80,256 (39,408 ) (41 )% 17,005 21 % Other banking related revenues 35,988 35,821 12,006 167 % 23,815 * Net banking revenues $ 603,761 $ 559,729 $ 425,032 $ 44,032 8 % $ 134,697 32 % * Percentage not meaningful. Banking interest income is earned from interest earning banking assets (primarily loans receivable and mortgage backed securities). Banking interest income increased $219.9 million in 2004. This increase was driven by a 31% rise in average loans receivable, net and a 30% rise in the average balance of mortgage backed and other available for sale securities. The 2003 decrease reflects a lower average yield on the Companys interest earning assets due to the decline in market interest rates, which was partially offset by increases in average interest earning banking asset balances and increases in higher yielding interest earning assets, such as consumer loans. Banking interest expense is incurred through interest bearing banking liabilities, including customer deposits, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings. Banking interest expense increased 3% during 2004 from a 29% increase in average interest bearing liabilities, significantly offset by a 57 basis point reduction in the average interest rate paid on those liabilities, reflecting the continued growth of the SDA. The decrease in banking interest expense during 2003 reflects a lower average cost of borrowings, partially offset by a 25% increase in the average interest bearing liability balance. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Banking interest income and interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The following table shows the income (expenses) on hedges that are included in banking interest income and expense (in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 2004 2003 2002 $ Amount % $ Amount % Banking interest income: Banking interest income, gross $ 985,535 $ 787,015 $ 808,454 $ 198,520 25 % $ (21,439 ) (3 )% Hedge expense (17,124 ) (38,488 ) (40,867 ) 21,364 56 % 2,379 6 % Banking interest income, net of hedges 968,411 748,527 767,587 219,884 29 % (19,060 ) (2 )% Banking interest expense: Banking interest expense, gross (295,464 ) (300,317 ) (374,323 ) 4,853 2 % 74,006 20 % Hedge expense (196,467 ) (175,507 ) (174,336 ) (20,960 ) (12 )% (1,171 ) (1 )% Banking interest expense, net of hedges (491,931 ) (475,824 ) (548,659 ) (16,107 ) (3 )% 72,835 13 % Net banking interest income $ 476,480 $ 272,703 $ 218,928 $ 203,777 75 % $ 53,775 25 % Net interest spread is the difference between the weighted average yields earned on interest earning assets less the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest spread increased to 2.07% in 2004 from 1.50% in 2003. The increase in 2004 reflects, among other things, a rise in the benefits generated by our SDA product and several other initiatives that we instituted during 2003 and 2004 to lower our cost of funds by shifting the structure of our deposits from time deposits to transactional accounts that carry a lower cost of funds than certificates of deposit. These initiatives helped to widen our net interest spread, which has had, and we expect will continue to have, a positive impact on our net banking revenues, even in a rising interest rate environment. We expect this positive impact to continue as additional benefits are received from these initiatives. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by a $120.9 million decline in the gain on sales of originated loans, which we generate when we lend money and subsequently sell the originated loan. Gain on sales of originated loans, which includes gains on mortgage loans made by E*TRADE Mortgage and on consumer loans by E*TRADE Consumer Finance, declined during 2004 primarily because of reductions in the volume of direct to consumer mortgage loan originations resulting from rising interest rates in 2004. Conversely, the increase from 2002 to 2003 was due to an increased level of direct to consumer mortgage loan originations, which reflects higher refinance and home purchase volumes spurred by low mortgage interest rates during the period. Our 2003 results also reflected $4.8 million of gains from the sales of RV and marine loans, following the acquisition of E*TRADE Consumer Finance. The following table presents the net gains that the Company earned from the sales of originated loans (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 2004 2003 2002 $ Amount % $ Amount % Gain on sales of originated loans: Mortgage loans $ 64,810 $ 187,655 $ 128,506 $ (122,845 ) (65 )% $ 59,149 46 % Consumer loans 6,751 4,812 1,939 40 % 4,812 * Total $ 71,561 $ 192,467 $ 128,506 $ (120,906 ) (63 )% $ 63,961 50 % * Percentage not meaningful. If interest rates rise from the levels experienced in 2004, origination volumes, and correspondingly, our gain on the sales of originated loans, would likely decrease relative to what we experienced in 2004. If the Bank 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements continues to diversify its asset portfolio through purchases and originations of higher yielding asset classes, such as automobile, marine, RV and credit card loans, we will be managing assets that carry a higher risk of losses than our mortgage portfolio, which could lead to increases in charge offs and fluctuations in revenue. Gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net represents net gains from the sales of loans that the Company intended to sell within one year, as well as gains from the sales of securities sold by the Bank. The following table presents the net gains that the Company earned from the sales of loans held for sale and securities (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 2004 2003 2002 $ Amount % $ Amount % Gain on sales of securities, net: Gain on sales of securities $ 75,259 $ 97,780 $ 76,135 $ (22,521 ) (23 )% $ 21,645 28 % Impairment (13,959 ) (2,611 ) (16,603 ) (11,348 ) * 13,992 84 % Gain (loss) on hedges 1,906 (5,380 ) (1,906 ) (100 )% 7,286 * Gain on sales of securities, net 61,300 97,075 54,152 (35,775 ) (37 )% 42,923 79 % Gain (loss) on sales of loans held for sale, net: Gains on sales of loans held for sale 4,557 33,588 59,249 (29,031 ) (86 )% (25,661 ) (43 )% Loss on hedges (6,625 ) (23,168 ) (25,687 ) 16,543 71 % 2,519 10 % Loss on prepayments (1,379 ) (10,234 ) (7,458 ) 8,855 87 % (2,776 ) (37 )% Gain (loss) on sales of loans held for sale, net (3,447 ) 186 26,104 (3,633 ) * (25,918 ) (99 )% Total $ 57,853 $ 97,261 $ 80,256 $ (39,408 ) (41 )% $ 17,005 21 % *Percentage not meaningful. The $22.5 million decline in the gain on sales of securities in 2004 reflects a $36.5 million decline in the gain from sales of interest only and mortgage backed securities, offset by a $14.0 million increase in the gain from the sales of trading and investment securities. During 2004, the Company recognized other than temporary impairments on the value of its mortgage backed interest only securities and asset backed securities of $12.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, compared with a $2.6 million impairment on the value of interest only securities in 2003. The $21.6 million increase in the gain on sales of securities in 2003 was primarily attributable to a $53.5 million increase in the gain from sales of interest only securities, offset by a $31.4 million decrease in the gain from sales of investment and trading securities. The gain (loss) on sales of loans held for sale, net declined during 2004 and 2003, from the prior years results primarily because of a rise in interest rates, which lowered the volume of loan originations and the corresponding loan sales. The results for 2004 reflect offsetting losses on hedges, which the Company entered into to protect against the impact of changes in interest rates on market prices and future cash flows. Gain on sales of loans held for sale, net decreased in 2003 primarily because of a $25.7 million decline in the volume of correspondent loan sales and securitizations, which in turn, stemmed from an intentional reduction in our sales of loans due to market conditions. The Company recognized loan prepayment losses of $1.4 million in 2004 compared with $10.2 million in 2003 and $7.5 million in 2002 as a result of relatively higher interest rates in 2004 which reduced the volume of loans that refinanced and prepaid. Other banking related revenues stemmed from a variety of sources and in 2004, included $14.0 million of banking fees imposed on deposit and transactional accounts; $5.1 million of loan servicing fees; $8.0 million of fees earned from proprietary mutual funds; $5.5 million of credit card fees and $3.3 million for collateralized debt obligation management. The provision for loan losses reflects the Companys estimate of loan losses that occurred in the current period and adjustments to prior period estimates. We adjust this provision to reflect changes in the size, 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements composition and seasoning of the loans that the Bank holds. A seasoned loan is a loan that has been in existence long enough for the borrower to demonstrate a history of good payments. Although the provision remained relatively flat in 2004 compared to 2003 at $38.1 million and $38.5 million, respectively, the provision related to real estate and home equity loans increased significantly while the provision related to consumer loans decreased significantly. The increase in the provision for real estate and home equity loans was driven by the purchase of $2.1 billion of unseasoned HELOCs, which generally have higher delinquencies and charge offs than one to four single family loans. The decrease in the provision for consumer loans was due to the continued seasoning and lower charge offs related to our consumer loan portfolio, which consists primarily of loans secured by RVs, marine assets and automobiles. This decrease more than offset the increase in the consumer provision related to credit card receivables that had been acquired in 2003 and 2004 and are, as yet, relatively unseasoned and experiencing higher charge offs in 2004 as compared to 2003. Allowance for loan losses is an accounting estimate of credit losses inherent in the Banks loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category. This allocation does not necessarily prevent the Company from shifting the allowance for loan losses between categories to better align the allowance for loan losses with the actual performance of the portfolio (dollars in thousands): Consumer(1) Real Estate and HomeEquity(2) Total Allowance Allowances as % ofconsumer loans held for investment Allowance Allowances as % ofreal estate loans held for investment Allowance Allowances as % oftotal loans held for investment December 31, 2004 $ 29,686 0.72 % $ 17,995 0.24 % $ 47,681 0.41 % December 31, 2003 $ 32,185 0.75 % $ 5,662 0.15 % $ 37,847 0.46 % (1) Primarily RV, automobile and credit card loans. (2) Primarily one to four family mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have historically met our liquidity needs primarily through investing and financing activities, consisting principally of equity and debt offerings, increases in core deposit accounts, other borrowings and sales of loans or securities. We believe that we will be able to renew or replace our funding sources at prevailing market rates, which may be higher or lower than current rates, as well as to supplement these funding sources with cash flow from operations. We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support expansion, fund regulatory capital requirements, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies and or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cash Provided by Operating Activities The following table presents those significant items affecting our operating cash position for the periods indicated (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net income (loss) $ 380,483 $ 203,027 $ (186,405 ) Selected non cash charges: Depreciation, amortization and discount accretion 398,297 443,746 325,980 Non cash restructuring costs and other exit charges 15,029 70,811 11,880 Cumulative effect of accounting change 293,669 Net effect of changes in brokerage related assets and liabilities 105,269 (103,595 ) 102,996 Net loans held for sale activity 793,457 710,378 2,533,052 Net trading securities activity 231,956 (454,905 ) (354,565 ) Other assets (84,778 ) 72,867 (333,461 ) Total other net activity* (209,123 ) (259,526 ) (174,155 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,630,590 $ 682,803 $ 2,218,991 * Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for further detail. During 2004, cash provided by operating activities increased due to an increase in cash flows from net trading activity of $0.7 billion, a change in net brokerage related assets and liabilities of $0.2 billion and increased net income of $0.2 billion. The increase in cash flows from trading activity was due to a rise in the volume of trading securities sold during 2004. During 2003, cash provided from operating activities decreased primarily due to decreased gains from loans held for sale and increased losses from trading activities. Offsetting these decreases were sales of our shares in SBI, generating approximately $157.1 million in gains. During 2002, cash provided from operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in loans held for sale activity. This increase reflects the decision to reclassify $2.7 billion in loans held for investment to loans held for sale and the subsequent sale of these loans to fund the purchase of a more diverse portfolio of loans, including consumer loans, and the acquisition of E*TRADE Consumer Finance. We used the cash generated from the sale of these loans and additional $3.3 billion that we raised through financing activities to pay for a series of investments in our business, which included net purchases of mortgage backed and investment securities totaling $3.5 billion and the purchase of E*TRADE Consumer Finance for $1.9 billion. Share Repurchases and Debt Retirements From time to time our Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase and debt retirement plans, as they determine that they are likely to create long term value for our shareholders. The recently authorized plans are open ended and provide the flexibility to buy back common stock, redeem for cash the Companys outstanding convertible subordinated notes, retire debt in the open market or a combination of all three. Under these authorized plans, we have repurchased some of our common stock and retired some of our convertible subordinated notes. In 2004, we repurchased 13.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate $175.8 million. Also in 2004, we used $86.2 million in cash for a partial redemption of our 6.75% convertible subordinated notes. In 2003, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. In 2002, we repurchased 10.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate $43.5 million. Also in 2002, we retired 5.0 million shares of our common stock, valued at $28.8 million, in connection with the satisfaction of shareholders notes receivable. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $238.0 million available under these authorized plans to purchase additional shares of common stock or retire additional debt. 8.00% Senior Notes Due June 2011 In June 2004, we completed a private offering of an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes due June 2011 (the 8.00% Notes). The 8.00% Notes bear interest at 8.00%, payable semi annually, and are non callable for four years and may then be called by us at a premium, which declines over time. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective December 1, 2004 on $50 million of the 8.00% Notes. Under this swap agreement, we pay a variable rate of interest based on 3 month LIBOR plus 3.49%. The swap agreement is treated as an effective fair value hedge pursuant to SFAS No. 133. The indenture governing the 8.00% Notes contains various covenants and restrictions that limit how we may conduct our business. As a result of these covenants and restrictions we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. 6.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due May 2008 In May 2001, we completed a private offering of an aggregate principal amount of $325 million of the 6.75% convertible subordinated notes due May 2008 (the 6.75% Notes). The 6.75% Notes were convertible, at the option of the holder, into a total of approximately 29.7 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $10.925 per share. The 6.75% Notes bore interest at 6.75%, payable semiannually, were non callable for three years and were subsequently callable by us at a premium, which declined over time. In June 2004, we called $162.5 million of the 6.75% Notes and in July 2004 called the remaining $162.5 million. Of these notes, total principal of $81.3 million was converted into 7.4 million shares of our common stock, with $1.3 million recorded in additional paid in capital for its portion of the premium and unamortized debt offering costs. The remaining principal of $243.7 million was redeemed for cash. 6.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due February 2007 In February and March 2000, we completed a private offering of an aggregate principal amount of $650 million of the 6.00% convertible subordinated notes due February 2007 (the 6.00% Notes). The 6.00% Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a conversion price of $23.60 per share (7.8 million shares based on the $185.2 million principal amount of notes outstanding at December 31, 2004). The 6.00% Notes bear interest at 6.00%, payable semiannually, and are non callable for three years and may then be called by us at a premium, which declines over time. The holders have the right to require redemption at a premium in the event of a change in control or other defined redemption events. Through 2003, we retired $279.7 million of the 6.00% Notes. In July 2004, we called $185.2 million of the 6.00% Notes for cash. We are not subject to any restrictive covenants in connection with the 6.00% Notes. Other Sources of Liquidity At December 31, 2004 we had financing facilities totaling $400.0 million to meet the needs of E*TRADE Clearing. These facilities, if used, would be collateralized by customer securities. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 under these lines. At December 31, 2004, we also had a total of $39.8 million of loans outstanding, collateralized by equipment owned by us, which we used to finance fixed assets purchases. In addition, we have numerous agreements with other broker dealers to provide financing under our stock loan program. In our banking operations, we seek to maintain a stable funding source for future periods, in part, by attracting core deposit accounts that tend to be relatively stable even in a changing interest rate environment. Typically, time deposit accounts, transactional accounts and accounts that maintain a relatively high balance provide a relatively stable source of funding. In 2003, we began sweeping brokerage customer money market 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements fund balances to the Bank, which were previously held in money market funds not on our balance sheets. On average, our retail banking customers maintained 1.49 accounts with a balance of $20,370 at December 31, 2004. Savings and transactional deposits increased from $316.8 million at December 31, 2003 to $431.0 million at December 31, 2004, a 36% increase. Retail certificates of deposit decreased from $3.2 billion at December 31, 2003 to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2004, or 36%. Brokered certificates of deposit increased from $292.5 million at December 31, 2003 to $294.6 million at December 31, 2004 or 1%. We also rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to provide liquidity for the Bank. Total banking related borrowings increased 80% from $6.5 billion at December 31, 2003 to $11.7 billion at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the Bank had approximately $6.2 billion in additional borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Due in Thereafter Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 General obligations: Convertible and senior notes(1) $ 42,287 $ 42,287 $ 217,268 $ 31,177 $ 31,177 $ 445,553 $ 809,749 Operating lease payments 22,185 21,793 21,042 20,176 18,110 29,649 132,955 Venture capital funding commitments(2) 11,425 10,000 9,750 31,175 Facility consolidation obligations(3) 9,927 8,272 5,201 3,818 3,003 1,787 32,008 Capital lease payments 163 163 Other commitments(4) 26,200 26,200 Total general obligations 112,187 82,352 253,261 55,171 52,290 476,989 1,032,250 Banking obligations: Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities(1) 15,776 15,776 15,776 15,776 15,776 624,329 703,209 Certificates of deposit(5)(6) 1,639,196 385,203 248,345 94,032 73,275 31,318 2,471,369 Other borrowings by bank subsidiary(6) 10,264,844 335,247 276,884 234,642 222,723 336,698 11,671,038 Loan commitments: Originate loans(7) 566,941 566,941 Purchase loans 178,248 178,248 Sell mortgages (92,451 ) (92,451 ) Security commitments: Purchase securities 372,014 372,014 Sell securities (856,059 ) (856,059 ) Total banking obligations 12,088,509 736,226 541,005 344,450 311,774 992,345 15,014,309 Total contractual obligations $ 12,200,696 $ 818,578 $ 794,266 $ 399,621 $ 364,064 $ 1,469,334 $ 16,046,559 (1) Includes annual interest or dividend payments; does not assume early redemption under current call provisions.

Interest rates were assumed to remain flat over the life of all adjustable rate instruments. (7) Contains optional commitment to originate. At December 31, 2004, the Bank also had commitments of $1.5 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under HELOCs and $1.5 billion of unused credit card lines. Since these lines may be used at the customers discretion, there are no scheduled maturities or payments. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. Allowances for loan losses and uncollectible margin loans Management evaluates the Banks loan portfolio and establishes an allowance that it believes is at least equal to the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. When establishing this allowance, management considers a number of factors including historical and industry loss rates, estimated cash flows and collateral values. In addition, management also considers numerous quantitative factors that may influence the overall credit performance of the Banks loans, such as adjustments to policies and procedures, changes affecting third party service providers and other market factors. This analysis is performed both for individual loans with large balances, as well as for groups of loans with similar risk characteristics. Although the Company has considerable experience in performing these reviews, if managements underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or significant unanticipated changes to the national or regional economies occur, the allowance for loan losses would have to be adjusted. If the loan losses that we actually incur are significantly different from our estimates, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses in the future. At December 31, 2004, our allowance for loan losses was $47.7 million on $11.6 billion of loans we intend to hold for investment. In addition to our banking loans, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin loans. At December 31, 2004, margin accounts had approximately $2.2 billion in outstanding margin loans for which we provided an allowance for uncollectible margin loans of $2.0 million based on historical experience, as well as the review of certain individual customer accounts and the specific identification of uncollectible amounts. Classification and valuation of certain investments The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. Investment classifications are subject to ongoing review and change. When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing losses based on market conditions and other factors. If our estimates change, we may recognize additional losses. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our Bank are recognized in gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net. Our brokerage operations hold trading securities for market making purposes and record the net gains in revenues as principal transactions. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans held for sale and securities, net for our banking investments and gain (loss) on sale and impairment of investments for our brokerage and corporate investments. Impairment of mortgage backed or asset backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security fails both tests, the Company writes the security down to fair value in the current period. The Company assesses securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. During 2004, we recognized $18.4 million of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Valuation and accounting for financial derivatives The Banks principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are customer deposits and other short term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long term and short term interest rates. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be designated as such by management, who must also continue to demonstrate that the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item. We designated substantially all derivatives we held on December 31, 2004 as hedges. To determine whether a derivative instrument will continue to meet the effectiveness requirements, we must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. Estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax expense based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which reduces our overall income tax expense. Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, resolution with taxing authorities of issues with previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. Our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $41.1 million and $84.5 million respectively, net of a valuation allowance of $52.7 million and $70.2 million, respectively. Valuation of goodwill and other intangibles We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Assets. In 2004, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill with the assistance of a third party. This evaluation indicated that no additional impairment charge was necessary. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2004 was $395.0 million, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. The Companys recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2004 were $134.1 million, which have useful lives between three and thirty years. We evaluate the remaining useful lives on intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. If our estimates of useful lives change, the unamortized cost is allocated to the revised useful life and amortized over that period in a manner consistent with which that asset is consumed or contributes to the net revenues of the Company. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to the Nature of the Financial Services Business Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than we do and offer a wider range of financial products and services. Many also have greater name recognition, greater market acceptance and larger customer bases. These competitors may conduct extensive promotional activities and offer better terms, lower prices and or different products and services than we do. Moreover, some of our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services. This means that our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand changing market conditions better than we can. Downturns or disruptions in the securities markets could reduce transaction volumes and margin borrowing and increase our dependence on our more active customers who receive lower prices A significant portion of our revenues in recent years has been from online investing services, and although we continue to diversify our revenue sources, we expect this business to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Like other financial services firms, we are affected directly by national and global economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, disruptions to the securities markets and changes in volume and price levels of securities and futures transactions. A decrease in transaction volume may be more significant for us with respect to our less active customers, increasing our dependence on our more active and professional trading customers who receive more favorable pricing based on their transaction volume. Decreases in volumes, as well as securities prices, are also typically associated with a decrease in margin borrowing. Because we generate revenue from interest charged on margin borrowing, such decreases result in a reduction of revenue to E*TRADE Clearing. When transaction volume is low, our operating results may be harmed in part because some of our overhead costs may remain relatively fixed. Downturns in the securities markets increase the credit risk associated with margin lending or stock loan transactions We permit customers to purchase securities on margin. When the market declines rapidly, there is an increased risk that the value of the collateral we hold in connection with these transactions could fall below the amount of a customers indebtedness. Similarly, as part of our broker dealer operations, we frequently enter into arrangements with other broker dealers for the lending of various securities. Under regulatory guidelines, when we borrow or lend securities, we must generally simultaneously disburse or receive cash deposits. We may risk losses if there are sharp changes in market values of many securities and the counterparties to the borrowing and lending transactions fail to honor their commitments. Any downturn in public equity markets may lead to a greater risk that parties to stock lending transactions may fail to meet their commitments. We may be unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates and the interest bearing assets in our portfolio The results of operations for the Bank depend in large part upon its level of net interest income, that is, the difference between interest income from interest earning assets (such as loans and mortgage backed and other asset backed securities) and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). The Bank uses derivatives to help manage its interest rate risk. However, derivatives utilized may not be entirely effective and changes in market interest rates and the yield curve could reduce the value of the Banks financial assets and reduce net interest income. Many factors affect interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Banks diversification of its asset portfolio may increase the level of charge offs As the Bank diversifies its asset portfolio through purchases and originations of higher yielding asset classes, such as RV and marine loans and credit card portfolios, we will have to manage assets that carry a higher risk of default than our mortgage portfolio. Consequently, the level of charge offs associated with these assets may be higher than previously experienced. In addition, if the overall economy weakens, we could experience higher levels of charge offs. If expectations of future charge offs increase, a corresponding increase in the amount of our allowance for loan loss would be required. The increased level of provision for loan losses recorded to meet additional allowance for loan loss requirements could adversely affect our financial results, if those higher yields do not cover the provision for loan losses. An increase in our delinquency rate could adversely affect our results of operations Our underwriting criteria or collection methods may not afford adequate protection against the risks inherent in the loans comprising our consumer loan portfolio. In the event of a default, the collateral value of the financed item may not cover the outstanding loan balance and costs of recovery. In the event our portfolio of consumer finance receivables experiences higher delinquencies, foreclosures, repossessions or losses than anticipated, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. Risks associated with principal trading transactions could result in trading losses A majority of our specialist and market making revenues at ETCM ES are derived from trading by ETCM ES as a principal. ETCM ES may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of securities for its own account, as well as trading losses in its specialist stocks and market maker stocks. From time to time, ETCM ES may have large positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry. ETCM ES also operates a proprietary trading desk separately from its specialist and market maker operations, which may also incur trading losses. Certain portions of our professional business are also involved in proprietary trading, in which the firm provides capital that is used for trading by employees and others. As with ETCM ESs business, the proprietary trading positions of E*TRADE Professional may also result in trading losses. Reduced grants by companies of employee stock options could adversely affect our results of operations E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services is a provider of stock plan administration and options management tools. The FASB has issued new rules that will require companies to value and expense stock options they grant to their employees and employee stock purchase plan transactions in which the terms are more favorable to those available to all holders of the same class of shares beginning in mid 2005. This may result in companies granting fewer employee options and modifying their existing employee stock purchase plans, potentially reducing the amount of products and services we provide these companies and compelling us to incur additional costs so that our tools comply with the new FASB statement. Additionally, we may see a reduction in commission revenues as fewer options would be available for exercise and sale by the employees of these companies. Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers and or specialists could harm our specialist and market maker business The increase in computer generated buy/sell programs in the marketplace has continued to tighten spreads, resulting in reduced revenue capture per share by the specialist and market making community and reduced payment for order flow revenues for us. Similarly, a reduction in the volume and or volatility of trading activity could also reduce spreads that specialists and market makers receive, also adversely affecting revenues generated by ETCM ES. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Alternative trading systems that have developed over the past few years could also reduce the levels of trading of exchange listed securities through specialists and the levels of over the counter trading through market makers. In addition, ECNs have emerged as an alternative forum to which broker dealers and institutional investors can direct their limit orders. This allows broker dealers and institutional investors to avoid directing their trades through market makers. As a result, ETCM ES may experience a reduction in its flow of limit orders. If we do not successfully manage consolidation opportunities, we could be at a competitive disadvantage There has been significant consolidation in the online financial services industry over the last several years, and the consolidation is likely to continue in the future. Should we fail to take advantage of viable consolidation opportunities or if we acquire businesses that we are unable to integrate or manage properly, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Acquisitions entail numerous risks including retaining or hiring skilled personnel, integrating acquired operations, products and personnel and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on any acquisition or that future acquisitions will not be dilutive to earnings. We rely heavily on technology to deliver products and services Disruptions to or instability of our technology, including an actual or perceived breach of the security of our technology, could harm our business and our reputation. Our international efforts subject us to additional risks and regulation, which could impair our business growth One component of our strategy has been an effort to build an international business. We have established certain joint venture and or licensee relationships. We have limited control over the management and direction of these venture partners and or licensees, and their action or inaction, including their failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and or corporate governance, could harm our operations and or our reputation. Risks Relating to the Regulation of our Business We are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation. All of our broker dealer subsidiaries have to comply with many laws and rules, including rules relating to possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending and execution and settlement of transactions. We are also subject to additional laws and rules as a result of our specialist and market maker operations in ETCM ES. To the extent that, now or in the future, we solicit orders from our customers or make investment recommendations (or are deemed to have done so), or offer products and services, such as investing in futures, that are not suitable for all investors, we would become subject to additional rules and regulations governing, among other things, sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to customers. As part of our institutional business we provide clients access to certain third party research tools and other services in exchange for commissions earned. Currently, these activities are allowed by various regulatory bodies. However, changes have been proposed in the United Kingdom and the United States that may limit or eliminate altogether the services we could provide to clients in exchange for commissions. If these proposals are adopted, we may realize a decrease in our institutional commission revenues. Similarly, E*TRADE Financial Corporation, E*TRADE Re, LLC and ETBH, as savings and loan holding companies, and E*TRADE Bank, as a Federally chartered savings bank, are subject to extensive regulation, 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements supervision and examination by the OTS, and, in the case of the Bank, the FDIC. Such regulation covers all banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, recordkeeping, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel. If we fail to comply with applicable securities, banking and insurance laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business The SEC, NYSE, NASD, Commodities Futures Trading Commission or other self regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can, among other things, censure, fine, issue cease and desist orders or suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees. The OTS may take similar action with respect to our banking activities. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state could bring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws. The ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is dependent in part on the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable compliance system. The failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions. If we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulators, we may be fined or even forced out of business The SEC, NYSE, NASD, OTS and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and regulatory capital by banks. Net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets. Failure to maintain the required net capital could result in suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by the NYSE and or NASD, and could ultimately lead to the firms liquidation. In the past, our broker dealer subsidiaries have depended largely on capital contributions by us in order to comply with net capital requirements. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require an intensive use of capital could be limited. Such operations may include investing activities, marketing and the financing of customer account balances. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from brokerage subsidiaries could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock. Similarly, the Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OTS. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could harm a banks operations and financial statements. A bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of a banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the strength of components of its capital, risk weightings of assets, off balance sheet transactions and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require a bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets. To satisfy the capital requirements for a well capitalized financial institution, a bank must maintain higher Total and Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets ratios. As a non grandfathered savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulations that could restrict our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities We are required to file periodic reports with the OTS and are subject to examination by the OTS. The OTS also has certain types of enforcement powers over the Company, ETBH and E*TRADE Re, LLC, including the ability to issue cease and desist orders, force divestiture of the Bank and impose civil and monetary penalties for violations of Federal banking laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, under 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, our activities are restricted to those that are financial in nature and certain real estate related activities. We may make merchant banking investments in companies whose activities are not financial in nature if those investments are made for the purpose of appreciation and ultimate resale of the investment and we do not manage or operate the company. Such merchant banking investments may be subject to maximum holding periods and special recordkeeping and risk management requirements. We believe all of our existing activities and investments are permissible under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, but the OTS has not yet fully interpreted these provisions. Even if our existing activities and investments are permissible, we are unable to pursue future activities that are not financial in nature. We are also limited in our ability to invest in other savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation of its activities and investments, capitalization, community reinvestment, risk management policies and procedures and relationships with affiliated companies. Acquisitions of and mergers with other financial institutions, purchases of deposits and loan portfolios, the establishment of new Bank subsidiaries and the commencement of new activities by Bank subsidiaries require the prior approval of the OTS, and in some cases the FDIC, which may deny approval or limit the scope of our planned activity. These regulations and conditions could place us at a competitive disadvantage in an environment in which consolidation within the financial services industry is prevalent. Also, these regulations and conditions could affect our ability to realize synergies from future acquisitions, could negatively affect us following the acquisition and could also delay or prevent the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services. Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock We have incurred losses in the past and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable We have incurred losses in the past and we may do so in the future. While we reported net income for 2004 and 2003, we reported a net loss of $186.4 million for 2002. We expect that expensing stock options granted to our employees will have a material impact on our financial results We are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with stock option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value. In December 2004, however, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which among other things requires public companies to expense employee stock options and other share based payments at their fair value when issued. This statement is effective for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, and we plan to adopt this statement effective July 1, 2005. We expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our net income and earnings per share for the last six months of fiscal 2005 and for subsequent periods. As a result of this impact on our financial results, we may be forced to decrease or eliminate employee stock option grants, which could, in turn, have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We are substantially restricted by the terms of our senior notes In June 2004, we completed a private offering of an aggregate principal amount of $400 million of senior notes due June 2011. The indenture governing the senior notes contains various covenants and restrictions that limit our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or make other distributions; repurchase or redeem capital stock; 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements make investments or other restricted payments; enter into transactions with our stockholders or affiliates; sell assets or shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries; restrict dividend or other payments to us from our subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets. As a result of the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the appropriate parties and or amend the covenants. Our corporate debt levels may limit our ability to obtain additional financing. At December 31, 2004, we had an outstanding balance of $185.2 million in convertible subordinated notes and $400.0 million in senior notes. Our ratio of debt (our senior and convertible debt, capital lease obligations and term loans) to equity (expressed as a percentage) was 28% at December 31, 2004. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; or make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004, the price per share of our common stock has ranged from a low of $3.65 to a high of $15.40. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In the past, volatility in the market price of a companys securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key employees, reduce our access to capital and otherwise harm our business. We may need additional funds in the future, which may not be available and which may result in dilution of the value of our common stock In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our business growth plans. In addition, if funds are available, the issuance of securities could dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall. We have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a shareholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include: authorization for the issuance of blank check preferred stock; provision for a classified Board of Directors with staggered, three year terms; the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors; 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements a super majority voting requirement to effect business combinations or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; limits on the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; and advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings. Attempts to acquire control of the Company may also be delayed or prevented by our stockholder rights plan, which is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to protect shareholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the Company that do not offer an adequate price to all shareholders or are otherwise not in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. In addition, certain provisions of our stock incentive plans, management retention and employment agreements (including severance payments and stock option acceleration), and Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, we have evaluated such risks for our brokerage and banking segments separately. The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors. CORPORATE OPERATIONS Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2004, we had variable rate loans outstanding of approximately $39.8 million and $17.2 million at December 31, 2003. The monthly interest payments on these term loans are subject to interest rate risk. If market interest rates were to have increased immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points at December 31, 2004 and 2003, the interest payments would have increased by an immaterial amount. Equity Security Price Risk We currently hold an investment in SBI which is a Japanese yen denominated publicly traded equity security with a carrying value of $78.6 million and a gross unrealized gain of $66.3 million as of December 31, 2004. As the securitys market price and the value of the yen fluctuate, we are exposed to risk of a loss of some or all of the unrealized gains. We also hold another publicly traded equity security with a carrying value of $11.3 million and a gross unrealized gain of $5.6 million as of December 31, 2004. BROKERAGE OPERATIONS Our brokerage operations are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk. Equity Security Price Risk At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we held equity security inventories in both listed and OTC securities on both a long and short basis of $25.8 million long, $16.7 million short and $11.6 million long and $5.0 million short, respectively, as part of our market making, specialist and professional trading operations. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the equities market would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations because the absolute value of either long or short inventory is not material and changes in value of short inventory would partially offset changes in value in long inventory. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consists of brokerage and investment services outside of the United States. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected by factors, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide our services. We are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates on the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non U.S. dollar based revenues decreases. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated operating margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. To mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on our non U.S. dollar based revenues and operating expenses, we evaluate the costs and benefits to hedging our material net non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts. Currently, hedges of transactions are immaterial. Given the short term nature of our foreign exchange forward contracts, our exposure to risk associated with currency market movement on the instruments is not material. Financial Instruments For our working capital and reserves, which are required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations, we primarily invest in money market funds, resale agreements, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Money market funds do not have maturity dates and do not present a material market risk. The other financial instruments are fixed rate investments with short maturities and do not present a material interest rate risk. BANKING OPERATIONS As part of our banking operations, we acquire and manage interest bearing assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. Interest bearing instruments include investment securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and derivative financial instruments. These instruments are subject to changes in market value as interest rates change. Interest Rate Risk The Banks exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution of all interest sensitive assets, liabilities and derivatives. These items have differing risk characteristics that, if properly managed, can mitigate the Banks exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2004, approximately 46% of the market value of the Banks total assets was comprised of residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. The Banks liability structure consists primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as money market accounts, shorter term certificates of deposit and wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities. The derivative portfolio of the Bank is positioned to decrease the overall market risk resulting from the combination of assets and liabilities. The Banks market risk is discussed and quantified in more detail in the Scenario Analysis section below. Most of the Banks assets are generally classified as non trading portfolios and, as such, are not marked to market through earnings for accounting purposes. The Bank did maintain a trading portfolio of investment grade securities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, with fair values of $567 million and $821 million, respectively. Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the Net Present Value of Equity (NPVE) approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and then combined to produce a NPVE figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up 100, 200 and 300 basis points and down 100 basis points. The down 200 and 300 basis point scenarios are not presented at December 31, 2004 and 2003, because they result in negative interest rates. The sensitivity of NPVE at December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the limits established by the Banks Board of Directors are listed below (dollars in thousands): Change in NPVE At December 31, Board Limit Parallel Change in Interest Rates (bps) 2004 2003 +300 $ (158,207 ) (9)% $ (278,901 ) (26)% (55)% +200 $ (69,671 ) (4)% $ (175,696 ) (16)% (30)% +100 $ (2,321 ) % $ (76,145 ) (7)% (15)% 100 $ (149,651 ) (9)% $ 18,418 2% (15)% Under criteria published by the OTS, the Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at December 31, 2004 is characterized as minimum. Derivative Financial Instruments The Bank uses derivative financial instruments to help manage its interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the Banks mortgage portfolios, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options the Bank employs are primarily Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates, while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates. Mortgage Production Activities In the production of mortgage products, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk between the commitment and funding dates of the loans. There were $0.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2003, in mortgage loan commitments awaiting funding. The associated interest rate risk results when the Bank enters into Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs), whereby determination of loan interest rates occurs prior to funding. When the intent is to sell originated loans, the associated IRLCs are considered derivatives and, accordingly, are recorded at fair value with associated changes recorded in earnings. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
