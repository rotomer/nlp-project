OVERVIEW Key Strategy Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on growing and strengthening our retail business and leveraging that growth in our institutional business. We strive to grow our retail business by acquiring, expanding and retaining our relationships with the global retail customer. We plan to grow those relationships by providing product offerings built around price, functionality and service. We also intend to grow through appropriate and targeted acquisitions which leverage our existing business platform. As we grow our retail customer base and we hold more customers assets, we believe that our business will benefit from the management of our balance sheet by the institutional business. As we are able to manage our balance sheet on an enterprise wide basis, we become less dependent on our customers trading activity, which is dependent on levels of market activity, and are better able to generate recurring income. Thus, while commissions are still reported as the lead category in our income statement because most of our customers begin their relationship with us through trading activity, net interest income has become our leading category of revenue, and we anticipate this trend will continue. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by several external factors outside of our control, including: general economic conditions; customer demand for our products and services; competitor pricing on similar products and services; interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve; and the performance of the equity and capital markets. 20 Table of Contents In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers; successful integration of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions; deepening customer acceptance of our investing, trading, cash management and lending products including E*TRADE Complete; disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency; maintaining strong overall asset quality; and prudent risk and capital management. Management focuses on several key metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. These metrics are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For the Year Ended December 31,  Variance 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 Customer Activity Metrics Retail client assets (in billions) $ 178.5 $ 100.0 $ 82.9 79 % Daily average revenue trades 97,740 83,643 77,052 17 % Average commission per trade(1) $ 13.82 $ 15.63 $ 16.41 (12) % Customer cash and deposits (in billions) $ 28.8 $ 18.7 $ 19.0 54 % Products per customer(2) 2.1 1.9 1.7 11 % Company Financial Metrics Operating margin(3) 38 % 33 % 14 % 5 % Revenue growth 15 % 10 % 6 % 5 % Revenue per compensation and benefits dollar $ 4.47 $ 4.23 $ 3.68 6 % (1) Our average commission per trade is calculated by dividing retail segment commission revenues by the number of total retail trades. (2) We define a product as an account, an account feature that generates revenue, such as a margin enabled account, or an account function that creates a deeper customer relationship, such as bill pay. (3) Our operating margin is calculated by dividing our income before other income, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change by our total net revenues. Customer Activity Metrics Retail client assets are the market value of all client assets housed by us. Retail client assets include security holdings, cash (including money market funds), vested unexercised options and deposits. The level of client assets is an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in client assets indicates that existing and new customers are expanding use of our services. Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) are an indicator of the volume of transactions our retail customers conduct and are the predominant driver of commissions revenue. Average commission per trade is impacted by the mix between and within our retail domestic and international businesses. This is an indicator of changes to our customer mix and reflects the impact of changes to pricing. Customer cash and deposits are the balances of all customer cash, including deposits, free credits held and money market balances held in outside funds. Free credits represent credit balances in customer accounts arising from deposits of funds and sales of securities. Management considers cash and deposits to be indicative of the deepening engagement with our customers and in addition, this balance is a key driver of net interest income. 21 Table of Contents Products per customer is the average number of our products that a customer actively uses. This measure is an indicator of how well our product and service set appeals to our customer base. We believe increases to this measure are representative of our ability to cross sell and overall customer engagement with our products and services. Company Financial Metrics Operating margin is the percentage of every dollar of revenue that goes to net income before other income, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. This percentage is indicative of our operating efficiency. Revenue growth is an indicator of our overall financial well being and our ability to execute on our strategy. When coupled with the operating margin, the two provide information about the general success of current strategies. Revenue growth is the difference between the current and prior period total net revenues divided by the prior period total net revenues. Revenue per compensation and benefits dollar is a broad indicator of productivity. The increase in 2005 is an indicator of our ability to drive revenue growth using the existing infrastructure. Revenue per compensation and benefits dollar is total net revenues divided by compensation and benefits expense. Significant Events in 2005 Acquisitions Harrisdirect We completed our acquisition of Harrisdirect on October 6, 2005. At the time of the acquisition, Harrisdirect, an online discount brokerage company, had approximately 425,000 customers who conducted approximately 16,000 DARTs. As of October 6, 2005, Harrisdirect had approximately $34.8 billion in customer assets including $5.0 billion in customer cash. Margin debt was approximately $0.9 billion at the time of the acquisition. Harrisdirect was purchased for approximately $709 million in cash from Harris Financial Corp, a subsidiary of BMO Financial Group. As part of the financing to acquire Harrisdirect, we issued $450 million in fixed rate senior notes. BrownCo We completed our acquisition of JP Morgan Invest, LLC, more commonly known as BrownCo, on November 30, 2005. BrownCo, an online discount brokerage company, had approximately 186,000 customers who conducted approximately 28,000 DARTs. As of November 30, 2005, BrownCo had approximately $34.2 billion in customer assets including approximately $3.5 billion in customer cash. Brokerage receivables were approximately $3.1 billion at the time of the acquisition. BrownCo was purchased for approximately $1.6 billion in cash from JPMorgan Chase & Co. As part of the financing to acquire BrownCo, we issued $550 million fixed rate senior notes, $650 million in common stock and $450 million in face value of mandatory convertible notes. The common stock was sold in the market and proceeds were used for the BrownCo acquisition. Wealth Management Advisors We acquired two wealth management advisors, Kobren Insight Management and Howard Capital Management during 2005. These companies provide advisory and asset management services to retail clients. On a combined basis, these companies manage $1.5 billion in customer assets. The acquisition of these companies are part of our ongoing strategy to enhance our product offering to customers. The growth of our wealth management business extends our ability to provide customers with the complete support they are demanding to address their varied financial needs. Dispositions Consistent with our strategy to continually evaluate our businesses and maintain a focus on providing services consistent with our strategy, we made the decision to sell or exit several product lines. In 2005, we sold 22 Table of Contents our Consumer Finance business, exited our institutional proprietary trading business and made a decision to sell our professional agency business, ultimately executing a sale agreement in February 2006. The Consumer Finance business originated and serviced recreational vehicles (RVs) and marine loans. We retained the loan portfolio; however, we will no longer originate or service RV or marine loans. In addition to the above, we made the decision to surrender our rights to trade over the counter (OTC) stocks on the floor of the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) during the first quarter of 2006. We determined that we could provide similar services without a presence on the floor of the CHX. The listed stock trading business is not impacted by the decision regarding OTC stocks. Additional information about these dispositions and closures can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Introduction of E*TRADE Complete In 2005, we launched E*TRADE Complete, which offers consumers tools to aid in the optimization of investing, cash management and lending products. E*TRADE Complete tools currently include the Cash Optimizer, the Intelligent Investing Optimizer and the Intelligent Lending Optimizer. Customers can quickly transfer funds to modify deposit balances to determine the optimal distribution of cash between accounts based on their personal preferences. Each customers product selection and mix will depend on their price, liquidity, convenience and risk tolerance preference. The Intelligent Investing Optimizer makes it easy to develop an investment strategy for a customers uninvested cash targeted to specific goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. It also suggests allocations for large cap, small cap, international investment, fixed income and cash. The Intelligent Lending Optimizer is a tool that allows customers to model multiple lending scenarios to determine whether they can lower their borrowing costs. Customers can use E*TRADE Complete in conjunction with our other retail products. Introduction of Token Based Security In 2005, we began offering a token based security solution to our U.S. based retail customers. Using a token based security solution provides an added layer of security at their point of access to the Internet to safeguard their personal financial information. The tokens produce a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds making unauthorized access almost impossible. We believe comprehensive security protection is important to financial consumers and our token based security solution gives us a competitive edge in this area. Introduction of Complete Protection Guarantee During 2005, we developed the E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee, consisting of these separate programs. This program was launched in January 2006. Our promise to customers is that we will cover any loss that results from the unauthorized use of our products and services, subject to certain limitations. Under our Complete Payment Protection Guaranty, we ensure that customer payments and transfers are processed exactly as the customer desired. In the unlikely event that any customer payment or transfer is not sent as instructed, we will work with the customer to swiftly resolve the issue and reimburse the customer in full for any late fees, penalties or related finance charges incurred. In addition under the Complete Privacy Protection Guaranty, we assure our customers that we will undertake our best efforts to maintain their privacy and we will not sell personal information to third parties or marketers for any purpose. Enhanced Our Pricing Structure During 2005, we changed our pricing structure to reward our customers for holding assets with us and to align our structure with the competitive marketplace. In conjunction, we changed our customer segment definitions along with our pricing structure in 2005. Our current segment definitions are as follows: Active Trader In October 2005, a customer with 30 or more trades per quarter qualified as an Active Trader. In February 2005, a customer that executed 15 or more trades per quarter was an Active Trader. During 2004, a customer that executed 27 trades or more per quarter was considered to be an Active Trader. 23 Table of Contents Mass Affluent In October 2005, we changed our customer segment definition to less than 30 trades per quarter and holds $50,000 or more in assets in combined retail accounts. In February 2005, a Mass Affluent customer was a customer that executed less than 15 trades per quarter and had $50,000 or more in assets in combined retail accounts. During 2004, a Mass Affluent customer was a customer that executed less than 27 trades per quarter and had $50,000 or more in assets in combined retail accounts. Main Street Investor As established in 2005, a customer that executes less than 30 trades per quarter and less than $50,000 in assets in combined retail accounts. In February 2005, a customer that executed less than 15 trades per quarter and had less than $50,000 in assets in combined retail accounts. During 2004, a Main Street Investor was a customer that executed less than 15 trades per quarter and had less than $50,000 in assets in combined retail accounts. The table below shows our pricing as of December 31 for each period: Customer Segment Base Pricing in 2005 Base Pricing in 2004 Active Trader $6.99 to $9.99 per trade $9.99 per trade Mass Affluent $9.99 per trade $12.99 per trade Main Street Investor $12.99 per trade $19.99 per trade We changed our customer segment definitions and lowered our fees charged in February 2005 and October 2005. In addition to the fee schedule above, we have grandfathered certain trade pricing for customers acquired through our Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions. Enhanced Distribution Network We enhanced our distribution network by opening six new centers during 2005. Our 16 centers provide face to face assistance for retail customers. To better serve our customers, we have also added additional relationship managers bringing the total to approximately 200. Relationship Managers (RMs) assist retail customers with asset allocation and investment options. In addition, RMs are cash management specialists who are able to identify the best products to meet the customers needs. Change in Reporting Structure In January 2005, we revised our financial reporting to better reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker assesses our performance and makes resource allocation decisions. As a result, in 2005, we began reporting our operating results in two segments, retail and institutional, rather than our former brokerage and banking segments. For our retail segment, the realignment integrated the management and operations of investing, trading, cash management and lending product and service offerings, including margin loan activities, and stock plan administration products and services for the retail customer. For our institutional segment, the realignment integrated the management and operations of balance sheet management, market making and global execution and settlement services businesses, with a focus on creating greater integration within our institutional segment and stronger leverage of our retail segment. Expensing of Employee Stock Options During the second half of the year, we early adopted the accounting provisions requiring expensing of all employee stock options that continue to vest during the period and for all future grants of employee stock options. Pre tax compensation and benefits expense increased by $14.1 million in 2005 as a result of adopting the new accounting standard. 24 Table of Contents Significant Events in 2004 Sale of Our ATM Business In June 2004, we completed the sale of our ATM business for $107.0 million. We sold the ATM network as we determined that, although it was an important distribution channel, its direct ownership was not essential to providing this customer benefit and that the capital could be better used elsewhere in the Company. Continued Use of the SDA We began sweeping brokerage customers excess cash balances to the Bank in late 2003. In 2004, we continued sweeping funds and grew the SDA balance by $1.9 billion to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Further, we increased the balance to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2005. Repurchase of Common Stock Through Board approved plans, we repurchased $175.8 million, or 13.7 million shares of our common stock during 2004, as the Board determined that the use of cash to reduce outstanding common stock was likely to create long term value for our shareholders. Summary Financial Results (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) As of or For the Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 Total net revenues $ 1,703.8 $ 1,482.9 $ 1,342.7 15 % Net income $ 430.4 $ 380.5 $ 203.0 13 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.12 $ 0.99 $ 0.55 13 % Operating margin ($) $ 649.8 $ 495.8 $ 189.1 31 % Operating margin (%) 38 % 33 % 14 % 5 % Highlights of 2005 include: Net interest income increased 37% compared with 2004. The continued growth in customer cash and deposits is the primary factor that led to the increase in net interest income. Generally, customer cash and deposits are our lowest cost sources of funds. This increase was also driven by higher interest earning assets. Loans receivable, net increased $7.9 billion, or 69% compared with 2004. Loans receivable, net growth was focused on two core products consisting of $3.4 billion growth in mortgages and $4.6 billion growth in Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC.) Our consumer loan products are down $0.1 billion as we focused our efforts on growing mortgage loan products. Our significant growth during 2005 has not impacted our asset quality. The ratio of nonperforming loans, net to total loans, net remained relatively flat at 0.18% at December 31, 2005 versus 0.17% at December 31, 2004. We expect this ratio to increase over time as new loans season. Customer cash and deposits, which include deposits, free credits held and money market balances held in outside funds, increased by $10.1 billion over December 31, 2004. Retail deposits increased $3.5 billion, or 29%. The increase in deposits was mainly driven by our acquisitions and organic growth in the majority of our deposit products: SDA, money market and certificates of deposit accounts. Money market balances held in outside funds increased by $7.0 billion due to the acquisitions. We believe this growth is a result of our acquisitions and the introduction of E*TRADE Complete Cash Optimizer, as well as an overall focus on price, rate and functionality for our retail customers. DARTs increased 17% and 9% compared with 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases were driven by a combination of our acquisitions during 2005 and an overall focus on price, functionality and service for our retail trading customers. In addition, market performance also played a role in our performance. 25 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Highlights Total assets were $44.6 billion at December 31, 2005, up $13.5 billion from December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to a 69%, or $7.9 billion increase in loans receivable, net, and a $4.1 billion increase in brokerage receivables, net. Interest earning assets of $41.1 billion increased 38% compared to December 31, 2004. Interest earning assets include cash and equivalents, cash and investments segregated, brokerage receivables, trading and investment securities, loans receivable, net, loans held for sale, net and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock. Loans receivable, net were $19.4 billion at December 31, 2005 and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase was driven by a targeted effort to grow our residential mortgage loan portfolios including one to four family, HELOC and second mortgage loans. The one to four family loans portfolio grew $3.4 billion and the HELOC and second mortgage loans portfolio grew $4.6 billion during 2005. Loans receivable, net represented 44% of total assets at December 31, 2005 up from 37% at December 31, 2004. The growth in loans was primarily funded by growth in deposits and other borrowings. Brokerage receivables, net were $7.2 billion at December 31, 2005, up from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2004. A portion of the increase in brokerage receivables, net resulted from our acquisitions during the year. Excluding acquired balances, brokerage receivables grew by a notable 33%. Brokerage receivables include margin loans of $5.7 billion at December 31, 2005. Brokerage payables were $7.3 billion at December 31, 2005, up from $3.6 billion at December 31, 2004, predominantly the result of acquisitions during 2005. Deposits were $15.9 billion, up 30% or $3.6 billion during 2005. The increase was driven by mostly organic growth in certificates of deposit and money market accounts as well as by both organic growth and conversions into the SDA. Deposits provide one of our lowest cost sources of funding and are an important contributor to our net interest income growth. We believe this overall growth is a result of our introduction of E*TRADE Complete Cash Optimizer as well as an overall focus on price, rate and functionality for our retail customers. Borrowings at December 31, 2005 were up $5.0 billion including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings by Bank subsidiary and long term notes compared to December 31, 2004. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were up $1.2 billion compared to December 31, 2004. Other borrowings by Bank subsidiary were up $2.4 billion during 2005, primarily from growth in FHLB advances. The Banks primary sources of wholesale funding are from FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The increase in Bank borrowings funded the increase in loans receivable, net. Funding sources are selected based on pricing, liquidity and capacity during each period. Long term notes increased by $1.4 billion. Proceeds from note issuances were used to partially fund our BrownCo and Harrisdirect acquisitions. Long term notes issued included senior notes and mandatory convertible notes which increased $1.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively compared to December 31, 2004. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2005 Compared to 2004 Net income from continuing operations for 2005 was $446.2 million, an increase of $64.4 million or 17% compared to 2004. In 2005, we produced noteworthy asset and deposit growth. For the year, our revenue growth of 15% exceeded expense growth of 7% and resulted in an operating margin of 38%, up from 33% in 2004. Growth in revenues also was attributed to improved interest rate spread and higher net interest income from a larger balance sheet. The following sections describe in more detail the changes in key operating factors, and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenues, expenses excluding interest and other income. 26 Table of Contents Revenues The components of net revenues and the resulting variances were as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2005 2004 2003 $ Amount % Revenues: Commissions $ 458,834 $ 431,638 $ 422,709 $ 27,196 6 % Principal transactions 99,336 126,893 107,601 (27,557 ) (22 )% Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 98,858 140,718 247,654 (41,860 ) (30 )% Service charges and fees 135,314 97,575 110,058 37,739 39 % Other revenues 94,419 89,077 86,514 5,342 6 % Interest income 1,650,264 1,145,597 892,832 504,667 44 % Interest expense (779,164 ) (510,455 ) (486,129 ) (268,709 ) (53 )% Net interest income 871,100 635,142 406,703 235,958 37 % Provision for loan losses (54,016 ) (38,121 ) (38,523 ) (15,895 ) (42 )% Net interest income after provision for loan losses 817,084 597,021 368,180 220,063 37 % Total net revenues $ 1,703,845 $ 1,482,922 $ 1,342,716 $ 220,923 15 % The table below presents revenues as a percentage of total revenue. The primary driver of revenue has shifted from commissions to net interest income after provision for loan losses. This shift is representative of our diversification of revenue streams. Net interest income continues to be our largest source of revenue and now represents 48% of total net revenues. Net interest income is earned primarily through lending, which includes margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding low cost deposits. Year Ended December 31, Variance 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 Revenues: Commissions 27 % 29 % 32 % (2 )% Principal transactions 6 9 8 (3 ) Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 6 9 18 (3 ) Service charges and fees 8 7 8 1 Other revenues 5 6 7 (1 ) Net interest income after provision for loan losses 48 40 27 8 Total net revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % % Commissions Commissions revenue increased 6% to $458.8 million in 2005 from $431.6 million in 2004. The average commission per trade is impacted by the mix between and within our domestic and international businesses. The primary factors that affect our commissions are DARTs and average commissions per trade. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the executed trades between these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates and as a result, changes in the mix of trade types within these businesses impact average commission per trade. Retail commissions increased $10.8 million compared to 2004 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. Increased market pressures, strategic pricing and a change in the composition of our retail customer base have resulted in lower average commission per trade, down 12% from 27 Table of Contents 2004. Our retail customers are divided into three categories: Active Trader, Mass Affluent and Main Street Investor. Each segment receives product pricing based on its service usage level, with Active Traders receiving the most favorable pricing. During 2005, growth in Active Trader and Mass Affluent customer trading volumes outweighed Main Street Investor trading volumes, contributing to our lower average commission per trade. Due to the factors described above, our growth in DARTs by 17% has equated to only a 3% increase in retail commissions revenue during 2005; however, our business model derives revenue from not only trades but the full relationship with the customer, especially customers who deposit cash with us. Our average customer purchases at least 2 products or services from our suite of retail products. So while retail commissions increased 3% during 2005, total revenue increased 15%. Institutional commissions increased to $119.2 million in 2005 from $102.7 million in 2004. The increase reflects growth in wholesale trading. In early 2005, an institutional wholesale trading group was created to trade large blocks of stock for institutional customers. We provide institutional customers with global trading and settlement services, as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties, in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates, which differ by customer. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 22% in 2005 compared to 2004. Principal transactions decreased due to lower market making volumes and market volatility. Principal transactions primarily consist of revenues from market making. As such, our principal transactions revenues are influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the trading performance of our proprietary trading activities. 28 Table of Contents Gain on Sales of Loans and Securities, net As shown in the following table, gain on sales of loans and securities, net decreased 30% to $98.9 million in 2005, compared to 2004 (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2005 2004 2003 $ Amount % Gain (loss) on sales of originated loans: Mortgage loans $ 39,161 $ 64,810 $ 187,655 $ (25,649 ) (40 )% Consumer loans(1) 15,686 17,906 (37,262 ) (2,220 ) (12 )% Gain on sales of originated loans 54,847 82,716 150,393 (27,869 ) (34 )% Gain (loss) on sales of loans held for sale, net: Gain (loss) on sales of loans held for sale (3,210 ) 4,557 33,588 (7,767 ) * Gain (loss) on hedges 2,282 (6,625 ) (23,168 ) 8,907 * Loss on loan prepayments (280 ) (1,379 ) (10,234 ) 1,099 80 % Gain (loss) on sales of loans held for sale, net (1,208 ) (3,447 ) 186 2,239 65 % Gain on sales of loans, net 53,639 79,269 150,579 (25,630 ) (32 )% Gain on sales of securities, net: Gain on sales of securities 84,577 75,408 97,780 9,169 12 % Impairment (38,343 ) (13,959 ) (2,611 ) (24,384 ) * Gain (loss) on hedges (1,015 ) 1,906 (1,015 ) * Gain on sales of securities, net 45,219 61,449 97,075 (16,230 ) (26 )% Total gain on sales of loans and securities, net $ 98,858 $ 140,718 $ 247,654 $ (41,860 ) (30 )% * Percentage not meaningful (1) Consumer loans originated by our retail segment and sold to our institutional segment were sold at an arms length transfer price. The gains (losses) associated with our retail segment were reclassified to discontinued operations and the amounts related to our institutional segment remained in continuing operations. The decline in the total gain on sales of loans and securities, net was primarily due to lower gains on sales of originated mortgage loans. This was the result of an overall decline in mortgage industry volumes as interest rates continued to rise during 2005. Impairment losses in 2005 relate primarily to interest only securities and to a lesser extent certain investment securities. Impairments on certain interest only securities were the result of short term movements in interest rates. Impairments on investment securities were the result of credit losses in certain investment securities secured by manufactured housing loans. These impairments were not indicative of a specific issue with our investments, but rather an overall deterioration in the manufactured housing loan market. Service Charges and Fees Service charges and fees increased 39% to $135.3 million in 2005 compared to $97.6 million in 2004. The 2005 increase was primarily due to increases in account service fees of $27.5 million in 2005. The increase in account service fees is due to an increase in account service fees charged from $25 to $40 per quarter, beginning the first quarter of 2005, for customers who did not meet certain criteria for balance and or activity levels. Service charges and fees represent account service fees, advisory fees, servicing fee income and other customer service fees. Advisory fees increased by $5.2 million in 2005 compared to 2004 resulting from our acquisitions of investment advisory firms. Servicing rights impairment decreased $4.6 million due to lower impairment writedowns in 2005. This decrease resulted from the overall rise in interest rates during 2005. 29 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues increased 6% to $94.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The increases are due to increased options transaction fees and 12b 1 fees, offset by decreases in proprietary fund revenues relating to the closure of certain of our proprietary funds. Other revenues include foreign exchange margin revenues, stock plan administration products revenues and other revenues ancillary to our retail customer transactions. Net Interest Income Net interest income increased 37% to $871.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to an increase in interest earning assets and margin loan balances. Net interest income represents interest earned on interest earning assets (primarily loans receivable and mortgage backed and related available for sale securities), margin loans, stock borrow balances, cash required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines and fees on customer assets invested in money market accounts, net of interest paid on interest bearing banking liabilities (primarily customer deposits, repurchase agreements, other borrowings and advances from the FHLB), paid to customers on certain credit balances and to banks and other broker dealers through our brokerage subsidiarys stock loan program. Net interest spread is the difference between the weighted average yields earned on interest earning banking assets and the weighted average rates paid on interest bearing banking liabilities. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our actions have created a balance sheet characterized by strong asset quality and flexibility to take advantage of, where appropriate, changing interest rates and to adjust to changing market conditions. We anticipate that interest rates will continue to rise in 2006 and that the overall impact of a rise in long term interest rates will be beneficial to net interest income. We expect a negative impact on net interest spread if the interest rate yield curve remains flat or inverts. We believe growth in customer cash balances and customer margin balances will offset this risk of a decline in net interest spread. Interest income and interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in interest income and expense (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2005 2004 2003 $ Amount % Interest income: Interest income, gross $ 1,662,745 $ 1,162,721 $ 931,320 $ 500,024 43 % Hedge expense (12,481 ) (17,124 ) (38,488 ) 4,643 27 % Interest income, net 1,650,264 1,145,597 892,832 504,667 44 % Interest expense: Interest expense, gross (695,634 ) (313,988 ) (310,622 ) (381,646 ) (122 )% Hedge expense (83,530 ) (196,467 ) (175,507 ) 112,937 57 % Interest expense, net (779,164 ) (510,455 ) (486,129 ) (268,709 ) (53 )% Net interest income $ 871,100 $ 635,142 $ 406,703 $ 235,958 37 % Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased $15.9 million to $54.0 million in 2005 from 2004. The increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily related to growth in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, 30 Table of Contents higher consumer loan related losses resulted from higher losses on RV and higher credit card bankruptcy activity as a significant number of customers filed for personal bankruptcy before the enactment of the new bankruptcy laws in October 2005. We expect provision on our consumer loans to decrease in 2006, as the increase in 2005 was primarily due to the enactment of the bankruptcy laws. We expect this to be more than offset by increased provision in the mortgage portfolio due to planned growth in 2006 as well as seasoning of the purchases made in 2005. During the third quarter of 2005, Hurricane Katrina inflicted significant damage to the gulf coast region. We currently do not estimate any related significant loss exposure in our loan portfolio. We have mortgage loans approximating $582 million in the FEMA designated impact areas. Many of the loans are to borrowers where repayment ability has not yet been determined to be diminished, or are in areas where the properties may have suffered little, to no damage or may not yet have been inspected. Of the $582 million in loans, approximately 99% were still performing as of December 31, 2005. We currently do not estimate any significant exposure from this natural disaster and will continue to refine our estimates as more information becomes available. See Balance Sheet Overview for additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for loan losses. Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the following table, expenses excluding interest increased 7% to $1.1 billion in 2005 compared to 2004 (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2005 2004 2003 $ Amount % Expenses excluding interest: Compensation and benefits $ 380,803 $ 350,440 $ 364,598 $ 30,363 9 % Occupancy and equipment 69,089 69,572 78,381 (483 ) (1 )% Communications 82,485 69,674 73,650 12,811 18 % Professional services 75,237 67,747 55,716 7,490 11 % Commissions, clearance and floor brokerage 140,806 129,696 124,868 11,110 9 % Advertising and marketing development 105,935 62,155 57,887 43,780 70 % Servicing and other banking expenses 52,326 35,971 37,575 16,355 45 % Fair value adjustments of financial derivatives 4,892 (2,299 ) 15,338 7,191 * Depreciation and amortization 74,981 77,892 85,615 (2,911 ) (4 )% Amortization of other intangibles 43,765 19,443 24,758 24,322 125 % Facility restructuring and other exit activities (30,017 ) 15,688 134,187 (45,705 ) * Other 53,751 91,144 101,042 (37,393 ) (41 )% Total expenses excluding interest $ 1,054,053 $ 987,123 $ 1,153,615 $ 66,930 7 % * Percentage not meaningful The increase in expenses was primarily driven by the following: Stock option expense increased by $14.1 million compared to 2004 as a result of adopting the new accounting standard requiring the fair value of share based compensation to be included in compensation expense. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Advertising and marketing costs increased by $43.8 million due to the launch of E*TRADE Complete, as well as an increase in our acquisition related marketing and customer retention marketing. Servicing costs increased due to growth in our loan portfolio which increased 69% compared to 2004. Intangible amortization increased primarily due to the impairment of our OTC specialist book. 31 Table of Contents In addition, the growth in expenses was partially offset by the following: The sale of the Consumer Finance servicing business which resulted in a credit to facility restructuring and other exit activities of $35.5 million. See dispositions and Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The favorable settlement of the Nomura litigation reduced other expenses by $35.0 million. See Legal Proceedings for more details regarding the settlement. Other Income As shown in the following table, other income decreased 62% to $26.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2005 vs. 2004 2005 2004 2003 $ Amount % Other income: Corporate interest income $ 11,043 $ 6,692 $ 6,550 $ 4,351 65 % Corporate interest expense (73,956 ) (47,525 ) (45,596 ) (26,431 ) (56 )% Gain on sale and impairment of investments 83,144 128,111 147,874 (44,967 ) (35 )% Loss on early extinguishment of debt (22,972 ) 22,972 * Equity in income of investments and venture funds 6,103 4,382 9,132 1,721 39 % Total other income $ 26,334 $ 68,688 $ 117,960 $ (42,354 ) (62 )% * Percentage not meaningful Other income decreased $42.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to lower gain on the sale and impairment of investments of $45.0 million and higher corporate interest expense of $26.4 million resulting from an increase in acquisition related senior notes in 2005, partially offset by the $23.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2004. During 2005, we sold shares of our investments in Softbank Investment Corporation (SBI), Archipelago Holdings, Ameritrade Holding Corporation and International Stock Exchange resulting in gains of $82.7 million. During 2004, gain on sale and impairment of investments was primarily related to gain on sale of our investments in SBI in the amount of $130.6 million. The $49.3 million decrease in other income in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted from the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $23.0 million and lower gain on sale and impairment of investments of $19.8 million in 2003. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense from continuing operations increased 26% to $229.8 million in 2005 from 2004. The increase in income tax expense is principally related to the increase in pre tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rate for 2005 was 34.0% compared to 32.2% for 2004. The lower effective tax rate in 2004 was principally due to tax benefits recognized in 2004 in connection with the sale of partnership interests which generated an excess tax basis adjustment and the closure of several open IRS tax issues. We currently expect our 2006 effective tax rate to increase to approximately 37%. For additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations The net loss from discontinued operations increased by $16.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, net was $4.0 million in 2005 resulting from the sale of the Consumer Finance origination business of $6.4 million offset by a $2.4 million loss related to the institutional proprietary trading unit. Loss from discontinued operations, net decreased by $11.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004, due to 32 Table of Contents lower operating losses in the Consumer Finance origination business of $7.4 million. In addition, losses from the E*TRADE Professional business were down $2.0 million and losses in the E*TRADE Access business were down $1.9 million compared to 2004. 2004 Compared to 2003 Overview Net income from continuing operations grew from $200.5 million for 2003 to $381.8 million for 2004. This growth was achieved due to higher revenues and lower expenses excluding interest. Revenues grew due to higher net interest income, which more than offset the decline in gain on sales of loan and securities, net. Net interest income was higher due to overall growth in our balance sheet coupled with increased SDA balances, providing us lower cost funds. The decline in gain on sales of loans and securities, net, was due to a slowing mortgage market and therefore, lower gains on loan sales, as 2003 was a strong year for mortgage loan sales. Expenses excluding interest were down mainly due to lower facility restructuring and other exit activities. We established a new restructuring plan in 2003, with only minor adjustments to such plans in 2004. Revenues Commissions Commissions revenue increased 2% to $431.6 million in 2004 from $422.7 million in 2003. Retail commissions increased 4%, or $12.8 million compared to 2003 due to higher DARTs offset by lower average commission per trade. Increased market pressures and new retail pricing in 2004 impacted our retail average commission per trade down 5% from 2003. In early 2004, we introduced Priority E*TRADE, targeted at Mass Affluent customers and created a third tier in our retail price structure. As a result, we saw growth in DARTs of 9%, while retail commissions increased 4%. Institutional commissions decreased 4% to $102.7 million from $106.6 million in 2003. The slight decrease in institutional commission revenues was mainly driven by the mix of customers and related pricing. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 18% in 2004 compared to 2003, due to higher market making revenues due to significantly increased volume from bulletin board stocks and to a lesser extent listed stocks, coupled with an increase in revenue capture on OTC traded shares. Gain on Sales of Loans and Securities, net Gain on sales of loans and securities, net decreased 43% in 2004 compared to 2003, due to a decline in gain on sales of loans, net of $71.3 million and gains on sales of securities of $35.6 million. The decrease in sales of originated loans was due to reductions in the volume of originated loans resulting from higher interest rates in 2004 over 2003. Gains on sales of securities, net reflected a decline in the gain from sales of interest only and mortgage backed securities. In 2004, we also recognized other than temporary impairments on the value of our interest only and asset backed securities. Service Charges and Fees Service charges and fees decreased 11% to $97.6 million in 2004 compared to $110.1 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in account service fees of approximately $14.5 million. The decrease in account service fees from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of accounts that were charged account service fees as customers either met the specified balance and or activity level, closed their accounts or had their account value taken to $0 as a result of the account service fee. 33 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues increased 3% to $89.1 million in 2004 compared to $86.5 million in 2003. The increase is primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in payments for order flow from an overall increase in trades including option trades. Payments for order flow are payments for orders which are sent between broker dealers. Net Interest Income Net interest income increased 56% to $635.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to an increase in average interest earning banking assets, margin loan balances and growth in customer deposits. Net interest income represents interest earned on interest earning banking assets (primarily loans receivable and mortgage backed and related available for sale securities), margin loans, stock borrow balances, cash required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines and fees on customer assets invested in money market accounts, net of interest paid on interest bearing banking liabilities (primarily customer deposits, repurchase agreements, other borrowings and advances from the FHLB), paid to customers on certain credit balances and to banks and other broker dealers through our brokerage subsidiarys stock loan program. Net interest spread is the difference between the weighted average yields earned on interest earning banking assets less the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing banking liabilities. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased $0.4 million to $38.1 million in 2004 from $38.5 million in 2003. The $12.4 million decrease in the provision for consumer loans was due to the continued seasoning and lower charge offs related to our consumer loan portfolio, which consisted primarily of RVs, marine and automobiles. The $12.0 million increase related to real estate and home equity loans was driven by the purchase of $2.1 billion of unseasoned HELOC, which generally have higher delinquencies and charge offs than one to four family loans. Expenses Excluding Interest In 2004, total expenses excluding interest decreased 14% to $987.1 million from $1,153.6 million in 2003. The primary driver of this decrease was due to significantly reduced facility restructuring and other exit activities, down $118.5 million. In mid 2003, we initiated the 2003 Restructuring Plan, which was focused on creating additional operating leverage by exiting unprofitable product offerings and consolidating operations. The 2003 Restructuring Plan also had a positive impact on reduced costs in 2004 as compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment and amortization of other intangibles declined in 2004 due to our efforts in 2003. Discontinued Operations The net loss from discontinued operations was $1.3 million in 2004, compared to a net gain of $2.5 million in 2003. The net loss in 2004 reflected both losses on the operations of our discontinued businesses of $32.7 million, nearly offset by a one time $31.4 million gain on disposal of discontinued operations, recognized from our sale of the E*TRADE Access business. Net losses from discontinued operations were higher in 2004 due to operating losses of the Consumer Finance origination business, which was later sold in 2005. 34 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW Retail As shown in the following table, retail segment income increased 49% to $458.8 million in 2005 compared to 2004 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2005 vs. 2004 2005 2004 2003 $ Amount % Retail segment income: Commissions $ 339,654 $ 328,889 $ 316,092 $ 10,765 3 % Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 63,705 93,694 235,064 (29,989 ) (32 )% Service charges and fees 116,102 84,445 104,531 31,657 37 % Other revenues 112,836 106,457 104,157 6,379 6 % Net interest income 445,124 322,278 133,970 122,846 38 % Net segment revenues 1,077,421 935,763 893,814 141,658 15 % Total segment expenses 618,664 628,146 769,318 (9,482 ) (2 )% Total retail segment income $ 458,757 $ 307,617 $ 124,496 $ 151,140 49 % Key Metrics: DARTs 97,740 83,643 77,052 14,097 17 % Average commission per trade $ 13.82 $ 15.63 $ 16.41 $ (1.81 ) (12 )% Average margin balance (in millions) $ 2,767 $ 2,048 $ 1,219 $ 719 35 % Retail client assets (in billions) $ 178.5 $ 100.0 $ 82.9 $ 78.5 79 % Products per customer 2.1 1.9 1.7 0.2 11 % Our retail segment generates revenues and earnings through investing, trading, cash management and lending relationships with retail customers. These relationships drive essentially five sources of revenues including commissions, gain on sales of loans and securities, net, service charges and fees, other revenues and net interest income. This segment also includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we are ultimately servicing a retail customer through these corporate relationships. Our geographically dispersed retail accounts grew by 20% in 2005. A portion of this growth is attributable to our acquisitions of BrownCo and Harrisdirect during the fourth quarter of 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 3.6 million active brokerage accounts and 0.7 million active banking accounts. The increase in retail segment income in 2005 from 2004 was due to an increase in net revenue primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, offset by lower gains on sales of loans and securities, net. DARTs increased 17% in 2005 compared to 2004. While the increase in DARTs did not produce a corresponding increase in commission revenues, these customers did help drive the increase in cash deposits held in SDA accounts. Higher SDA and deposit balances translate into a lower cost of funds as deposits increase in comparison to other borrowings. Retail net interest income in 2005 increased $122.8 million compared to 2004. The increase was driven by an increase in both average interest earning assets and the net interest spread earned. Growth in average margin balances continues to be strong for the retail segment, with average balances increasing 35%, to $2.8 billion in 2005 compared to $2.0 billion in 2004 including the impact of our acquisitions. Other key drivers of the increase in retail segment income were growth in the average balance of loans and deposits which increased 54% and 11%, respectively over last year. Service charges and fees increased by 37% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in account service fees. Offsetting these positive variances were lower gains on the sale of loans and securities, net of $30.0 million due to the lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans and securities impairment. The increase in retail segment income in 2004 from 2003 was due to an increase in net revenues and reduced expenses. Net revenue growth was largely driven by an increase in net interest income and, to a lesser 35 Table of Contents extent, commissions, offset by declines in gain on sales of loans and securities, net and service charges and fees. Retail net interest income in 2004 increased $188.3 million, or 141%. This increase was driven by increases in average margin balances up 68% to $2.0 billion from $1.2 billion in conjunction with the introduction of our SDA in 2003 which reduced the cost of funds, thus increasing net interest income. The reductions in gains on sales of loans and securities, net are attributed to lower loan sale volumes. In the retail expenses, facility restructuring and other exit activities declined as we incurred significant charges in 2003 related to our 2003 Restructuring Plan. Institutional As shown in the following table, institutional segment income increased 2% to $191.0 million in 2005 compared to 2004. (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2005 vs. 2004 2005 2004 2003 $ Amount % Institutional segment income: Commissions $ 119,180 $ 102,749 $ 106,617 $ 16,431 16 % Other revenues 163,923 203,731 150,455 (39,808 ) (20 )% Net interest income after provision 372,122 274,743 234,210 97,379 35 % Net segment revenues 655,225 581,223 491,282 74,002 13 % Total segment expenses 464,190 393,041 426,677 71,149 18 % Total institutional segment income $ 191,035 $ 188,182 $ 64,605 $ 2,853 2 % Key metrics: Average interest earning banking assets (in millions) $ 27,948 $ 22,332 $ 17,165 $ 5,616 25 % Total non performing loans, net, as a % of total gross loans held for investment 0.18 % 0.17 % 0.30 % 0.01 % Average revenue capture per 1,000 equity shares $ 0.458 $ 0.341 $ 1.180 $ 0.117 34 % Our institutional segment generates revenues and earnings from balance sheet management activities, market making and global execution and settlement services. The $2.9 million increase in institutional segment income in 2005 was attributable to a $74.0 million increase in revenues offset by a $71.1 million increase in expenses. The increase in revenues resulted from higher net interest income due to higher average balances of interest earning banking assets. The increase in net interest income was partially driven by a shift from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans. The increase in expenses was driven by an increase in intangible amortization, compensation and benefits expense and commissions, clearance and floor brokerage due to an increase in overall trading volumes and higher servicing expenses related to an increase in loans serviced. Intangible amortization increased primarily due to the impairment of our OTC Specialist Book. Compensation and benefits expense increased due to our initial adoption of expensing options under SFAS No 123(R) and increases in volume and performance based compensation. The increase in institutional segment income in 2004 from 2003 was due to an increase in net revenues and a reduction in expenses. The increase in net segment revenues was due to increases in net interest income of $40.1 million, gain on sales of loans and securities, net of $34.4 million and principal transactions of $19.3 million offset by a decline in commissions of $3.9 million. The increase in net interest income was the result of an increase in average interest earning banking assets by 30% and yield remaining flat, with a 29% increase in average interest bearing banking liabilities coupled with cost of funds declining 57 basis points. The decline in 36 Table of Contents expenses from 2003 to 2004 was largely driven by the decline in facility restructuring and other exit activities as we recorded significant charges in 2003 related to our 2003 Restructuring Plan. BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW The following table sets forth the significant components of our Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2005 2004 2005 vs. 2004 Assets: Cash and equivalents $ 844,188 $ 939,906 (10 )% Brokerage receivables, net 7,174,175 3,034,548 136 % Trading securities 146,657 593,245 (75 )% Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 12,564,738 12,543,818 % Loans receivable, net 19,424,895 11,505,755 69 % Loans held for sale, net 87,371 279,280 (69 )% Other assets 4,325,662 2,136,031 103 % Total assets $ 44,567,686 $ 31,032,583 44 % Liabilities and shareholders equity: Brokerage payables $ 7,315,659 $ 3,618,892 102 % Deposits 15,948,015 12,302,974 30 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 11,101,542 9,897,191 12 % Other borrowings by Bank subsidiary 4,166,592 1,760,732 137 % Corporate debt 2,022,701 585,617 245 % Other liabilities 613,617 638,975 (4 )% Total liabilities 41,168,126 28,804,381 43 % Shareholders equity 3,399,560 2,228,202 53 % Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 44,567,686 $ 31,032,583 44 % Total assets increased 44%, or $13.5 billion during 2005. This increase was driven primarily by loans receivable, net up $7.9 billion and brokerage receivables up $4.1 billion. Other assets increased due to goodwill and intangibles added as a component of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions. Excluding the initial balance of brokerage receivables at acquisition, organically generated brokerage receivables increased by 33%. Deposits increased $3.6 billion due to higher SDA and money market deposits. Our growth in borrowings including securities sold under agreements to repurchase relates to the funding of loan growth. Corporate debt increased due to the funding of our acquisitions in 2005. 37 Table of Contents Required Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies The following table shows where you can find certain tables containing certain required Bank Holding Company disclosures, most of which are included in the Required Financial Data section, beginning on page 54.

The increase of $7.9 billion to $19.4 billion at December 31, 2005 was due to a targeted effort to grow our one to four family and HELOC portfolios. These two portfolios now represent 79% of total loans receivable, net, up from 64% at December 31, 2004. We anticipate that our mortgage and HELOC portfolios will increase in the next year as we focus on these product lines; enhance our credit risk profile and focus on cross sell opportunities. We anticipate that RV and marine loan balances will decline over time due to the sale of the Consumer Finance Corporation and the continued decline in automobile loans due to the exit of the automobile origination business in 2004. Other loans include commercial loans which have increased during 2005. The increase in unamortized premiums is volume related and represents purchase premiums, net on real estate loans. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge off and loss experience, current industry charge off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. In general, the allowance for loan losses should be at least equal to twelve months of projected losses for all loan types. We believe this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. 39 Table of Contents The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands): Consumer & Other Real Estate Total Allowance Allowances as % of Consumer and Other Loans Receivable Allowance Allowances as % of Real Estate Loans Receivable Allowance Allowances as % of Total Loans Receivable December 31, 2005 $ 32,379 0.80 % $ 30,907 0.20 % $ 63,286 0.32 % December 31, 2004 $ 29,686 0.72 % $ 17,995 0.24 % $ 47,681 0.41 % The allowance as a percentage of total loans receivable declined in 2005. The lower percentage resulted from a change in the mix of assets. Our loan portfolio shifted to a higher percentage of mortgage loans, which generally incur lower losses than consumer loans. Mortgage loans represented 79% of total loans receivable, net at the end of 2005, up from 64% at the end of 2004. The increase in the allowance allocated to the consumer loans portfolio was the result of an increase in nonperforming RV and marine loans. The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses during the past five years (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Allowance for loan losses beginning of year $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 $ 19,874 $ 12,565 Loan charge offs: Real estate (936 ) (186 ) (364 ) (460 ) (94 ) HELOC, second mortgage and other (3,929 ) (1,464 ) (75 ) (79 ) RV (20,592 ) (18,419 ) (20,341 ) (3,456 ) Marine (8,009 ) (6,003 ) (7,369 ) Automobile (5,915 ) (13,796 ) (22,695 ) (28,046 ) (5,395 ) Credit card (17,286 ) (10,313 ) (919 ) Other (180 ) (160 ) (1,971 ) Total loan charge offs (56,847 ) (50,341 ) (53,734 ) (31,962 ) (5,568 ) Loan recoveries: Real estate 234 223 30 29 HELOC, second mortgage and other 526 310 4 RV 7,848 9,088 9,738 Marine 3,960 3,225 3,806 Automobile 5,382 7,464 8,335 10,632 669 Credit card 380 141 1 Other 106 279 541 Total recoveries 18,436 20,507 22,644 10,662 702 Net charge offs (38,411 ) (29,834 ) (31,090 ) (21,300 ) (4,866 ) Allowance acquired through acquisitions(1) 1,547 2,748 14,428 4,699 Provision for loan losses 54,016 38,121 38,523 14,664 7,476 Allowance for loan losses end of year $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 $ 19,874 Net charge offs to average loans receivable, net outstanding 0.26 % 0.30 % 0.41 % 0.28 % 0.07 % (1) Acquisition of credit card portfolios in 2004 and 2003, the E*TRADE Consumer Finance portfolio in 2002 and the automobile portfolio in 2001. 40 Table of Contents During 2005, the allowance for loan losses increased by $15.6 million. Approximately $12.9 million of this increase is due to higher real estate loans outstanding which increased by $8.1 billion during 2005. The remaining increase in the allowance was due to slightly higher expected losses on RV and credit card loans offset by lower automobile loan related losses. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by loan category (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Real estate loans: One to four family $ 4,858 37.0 % $ 2,812 32.3 % $ 2,360 28.6 % $ 3,343 29.8 % $ 8,716 73.7 % HELOC, second mortgage and other 26,049 42.3 15,183 31.9 3,302 19.1 851 6.8 157 0.4 Total real estate loans 30,907 79.3 17,995 64.2 5,662 47.7 4,194 36.6 8,873 74.1 Consumer and other loans: RV 13,465 14.1 11,343 22.4 11,386 28.3 9,480 24.8 3.1 Marine 4,590 3.9 4,116 6.3 2,503 7.9 3,108 8.4 Automobile 1,080 1.2 4,195 5.1 11,876 14.5 8,190 27.4 11,001 22.6 Credit card 11,714 1.0 9,078 1.8 5,583 1.4 Other 1,530 0.5 954 0.2 837 0.2 2,694 2.8 0.2 Total consumer and other loans 32,379 20.7 29,686 35.8 32,185 52.3 23,472 63.4 11,001 25.9 Total allowance for loan losses $ 63,286 100.0 % $ 47,681 100.0 % $ 37,847 100.0 % $ 27,666 100.0 % $ 19,874 100.0 % (1) Represents percentage of loans receivable in category to total loans receivable, excluding premium (discount). Actual losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For first lien position mortgages, a charge off is recognized when we foreclose on the property. For revolving loans, our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. The $8.6 million increase in net charge offs in 2005 was primarily due to higher net charge offs on credit cards of $6.7 million, marine and RV of $4.7 million and real estate loan portfolios of $2.8 million, offset partially by lower net charge offs on automobile loans of $5.8 million. Higher credit card charge offs are the result of increased bankruptcy filings as customers declared bankruptcy ahead of the new bankruptcy laws in October 2005. We do not anticipate that the 2005 level of credit card charge offs will continue. The increase in net charge offs was also due to growth in loans receivable and specific events affecting customer behavior during the period and not indicative of a decline in credit quality. Net charge offs decreased by $1.3 million in 2004 from the 2003 level due to lower automobile, RV and other losses of $10.8 million, partially offset by higher credit card losses of $9.3 million. 41 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets We classify loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Real estate loans: One to four family $ 18,067 $ 11,029 $ 18,094 $ 22,497 $ 20,595 HELOC, second mortgage and other 9,568 2,755 269 81 Total real estate loans 27,635 13,784 18,363 22,578 20,595 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 2,826 1,416 1,399 1,486 Marine 873 908 1,067 94 Automobile 448 826 1,602 2,277 91 Credit card 2,858 2,999 2,147 Other 14 22 16 53 Total consumer and other loans 7,019 6,171 6,231 3,910 91 Total nonperforming loans, net 34,654 19,955 24,594 26,488 20,686 REO and other repossessed assets, net 6,555 5,367 6,690 6,723 3,328 Total nonperforming assets, net $ 41,209 $ 25,322 $ 31,284 $ 33,211 $ 24,014 Total nonperforming loans, net as a percentage of total loans, net 0.18 % 0.17 % 0.27 % 0.36 % 0.26 % Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, net 182.62 % 238.94 % 153.89 % 104.45 % 96.07 % We expect that the amount of nonperforming loans will change due to portfolio growth, portfolio seasoning and resolution through collections, sales or charge offs. The performance of any loan can be affected by external factors, such as economic conditions, or factors particular to a borrower. During 2005, our nonperforming assets, net increased $15.9 million, or 62.7%, from $25.3 million at December 31, 2004. The increase is attributed to an increase in nonperforming real estate loans of $13.9 million. The overall growth in the real estate loan portfolio to $15.3 billion from $7.5 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively is contributing to the higher level of nonperforming assets. The increase in REO and other repossessed assets, net was due to the timing of RV and marine repossession sales and only a slight increase in real estate related foreclosures during 2005. The increase in nonperforming loans has not resulted in significantly higher charge offs in 2005. Our portfolio quality has not shown significant signs of deterioration; however, the overall level of nonperforming assets has increased as a result of this volume. If our nonperforming loans at December 31, 2005, had been performing in accordance with their terms, we would have recorded additional interest income of approximately $0.8 million during 2005. During 2005, we recognized $1.0 million in interest on loans that were in nonperforming status at December 31, 2005. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, net decreased in 2005 compared to 2004. The lower ratio results from a change in the mix of assets. As our loan portfolio shifts to mortgage loans with loan to value ratios that remain consistent or increase over the life of the loan, the level of the allowance to nonperforming assets may decrease. Real estate loan charge offs to average outstanding loans were 0.03% compared to 0.34% for non real estate loan charge offs. Real estate loans to total loans receivable, net are 79% for 2005 compared to 64% for 2004. 42 Table of Contents In addition to the nonperforming assets in the table above, we monitor loans where a borrowers past credit history casts doubt on the borrowers ability to repay a loan, whether or not the loan is delinquent (Special Mention loans.) Such Special Mention loans continue to accrue interest and remain as a component of the loans receivable balance. These loans represented $127.2 million and $71.8 million of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are actively monitored. Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities Available for Sale Available for sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2005 2004 2005 vs. 2004 Mortgage backed securities: Federal National Mortgage Association $ 7,269,348 $ 5,062,204 44 % Government National Mortgage Association 2,138,270 2,710,808 (21 )% Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 1,015,794 1,279,057 (21 )% Total mortgage backed securities 10,423,412 9,052,069 15 % Investment securities: Asset backed securities 1,365,754 2,796,429 (51 )% Publicly traded equity securities 435,765 374,842 16 % Other 339,807 320,478 6 % Total investment securities 2,141,326 3,491,749 (39 )% Total available for sale securities $ 12,564,738 $ 12,543,818 % Available for sale securities represented 28% of total assets at December 31, 2005 and 40% of total assets at December 31, 2004. We evaluate our portfolio of securities available for sale in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. During the period, we performed a balance sheet review and decided to enhance the liquidity of our portfolio by reducing our securities portfolio of asset backed securities and increasing our portfolio of mortgage backed securities. As interest rates increase, the fair value of available for sale securities decreases and vice versa. The fair value of the portfolio will be adversely impacted in 2006 if long term interest rates continue to rise. Net unrealized gains and losses in available for sale securities are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Deposits Deposits as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2005 2004 2005 vs. 2004 Sweep deposit account $ 7,733,267 $ 6,167,436 25 % Money market and savings accounts 4,635,866 3,340,936 39 % Certificates of deposit 2,703,605 2,069,674 31 % Brokered certificates of deposit 484,612 294,587 65 % Checking accounts 390,665 430,341 (9 )% Total deposits $ 15,948,015 $ 12,302,974 30 % Deposits represented 39% of total liabilities at December 31, 2005 and 43% of total liabilities at December 31, 2004. Deposits increased $3.6 billion to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2005, driven by a $1.6 billion increase in the SDA, a $1.3 billion increase in money market and savings accounts and a $0.6 billion increase in certificates of deposit. 43 Table of Contents The increase in the SDA was driven equally by organic growth of existing customer balances and conversions from money market funds. The increase in money market accounts was the result of our focused attention to sales and retention efforts for these customers, as well as the overall impact of E*TRADE Complete Cash Optimizer. E*TRADE Complete Cash Optimizer enables customers to determine the optimal use of their funds and has resulted in higher money market and certificate of deposit balances. The SDA, money market accounts and certificates of deposit generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding. The increases in the balances of these accounts are the product of the core customer relationship that we maintain within our retail segment. The increase in certificates of deposit reflects the renewed customer interest in the product as a result of focused retention efforts coupled with a higher overall interest rates offered in this product. Average deposits increased by $1.3 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. Average rates paid increased slightly as market interest rates increased throughout 2005.

These borrowings coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. During 2005, the Bank used these wholesale sources along with deposit growth to fund the increase in loans receivable. Other borrowings by Bank subsidiary represented 10% of total liabilities at December 31, 2005 and 6% of total liabilities at December 31, 2004. The increase of $2.4 billion during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in FHLB advances. We actively manage our funding sources and determine the optimal mix based on pricing, liquidity and capacity during each period. Corporate Debt Corporate debt increased $1.4 billion during 2005. This increase was due to the issuance of additional senior notes and mandatory convertible notes during the period, the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information about securities issued. 44 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our liquidity and capital resources enable us to fund our operating activities, and finance acquisitions and asset growth. Cash flows are derived from capital markets activities and core operations in the retail and institutional segments. The segment cash flows provide capital to fund growth in our regulated subsidiaries. A summary of the capital markets activity of the Company and a high level summary of our sources and uses of cash and equivalents at the parent company level during the year is discussed below. Changes in Cash and Equivalents In 2005, cash and equivalents at E*TRADE Financial Corporation, on a standalone holding company basis, increased $25 million to $94 million primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows of $340 million and the following significant activities and events impacting cash: The acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo for $2.3 billion; and Issuances of long term debt and equity of $2.2 billion. Our capital markets activity during 2005 included the issuance of common stock and debt securities. The following table shows our 2005 equity and debt issues: Month Issued Principal Amount(in millions) Fixed Coupon Rate Maturity September $ 100.0 8.00 %(1) June 2011 September 350.0 7 3/8 % September 2013 October 250.0 7 3/8 % September 2013 November 300.0 7 7/8 % December 2015 November 450.0 6 1/8 %(2) November 2018 Total debt 1,450.0 Equity(3) 718.4 Total $ 2,168.4 (1) This debt was issued at a premium with an effective yield of 7 1/4 %. (2) Mandatory convertible notes issued. (3) Includes $691.8 million issued in connection with funding our acquisition of BrownCo, Howard Capital, Kobren and other acquisitions. In November 2005, we issued 18.0 million units of mandatory convertible notes (Units) with a face value of $450 million. Each Unit consists of a purchase contract and a 6 1/8% senior note. We recorded the purchase contracts and senior notes at fair value with $15 million recorded in equity and $435 million in debt, respectively. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and the Company to sell, at a purchase price of $25.00 in cash, a variable number of shares of the Companys common stock. The stock conversion ratio varies depending on the average closing price of our common stock over a 20 day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding November 18, 2008 (Reference Price.) If the Reference Price is equal to or greater than $21.816 per share, the settlement rate will be 1.1459 shares of common stock. If the Reference Price is less than $21.816 per share but greater than $18.00 per share, the settlement rate is equal to $25.00 divided by the Reference Price. If the Reference Price is less than or equal to $18.00 per share, the settlement rate will be 1.3889 shares of common stock. The Company is obligated under the purchase contract to sell shares of its common stock under the agreement in November 2008. In November 2008, the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes will be remarketed, which may result in a change in the interest rate and maturity date of the senior notes. Additionally, in 2005, we entered into a $250 million, three year senior secured revolving credit facility, secured by certain of our assets. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes, including regulatory capital needs arising from acquisitions. This facility was unused in 2005 and requires us to maintain certain 45 Table of Contents minimum financial covenants, which we met during 2005. We believe that these restrictions will not have a material effect on our ability to meet foreseeable funding requirements. We had outstanding debt of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2005 as follows: Type Balance (in millions) Fixed Coupon Rate Year of Maturity Convertible subordinated notes $ 185.2 6.00 % 2007 Senior notes 504.4 8.00 % 2011 Senior notes 597.5 7 3/8 % 2013 Senior notes 300.0 7 7/8 % 2015 Mandatory convertible notes 435.6 6 1/8 % 2018 Total $ 2,022.7 For information regarding the terms of outstanding borrowings including senior debt, mandatory convertible notes and convertible subordinated notes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our current senior debt ratings are B1 (positive outlook) by Moodys, B+ (positive) by Standard and Poors and BB (low) by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS.) The Banks long term deposit ratings are BA2 by Moodys, BB+ (stable) by Standard and Poors and BB by DBRS. A significant downgrade in these ratings may impact our ability to borrow at current market spreads, at rates considered acceptable or at all. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity available to the parent company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, is limited by regulatory requirements of its subsidiaries. Converging Arrows, an investment company, is a subsidiary of the parent company. The $176.6 million of cash and investment securities owned by Converging Arrows is available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Converging Arrows is not restricted in its dealings with the parent company and may transfer funds to the parent company without regulatory approval. In addition to the investment company, brokerage and banking subsidiaries may provide liquidity to the parent; however, they are restricted by regulatory guidelines. The Bank is prohibited by regulations from lending to the parent company. At December 31, 2005, the Bank has approximately $192.5 million of capital available for dividend declaration without regulatory approval while still maintaining well capitalized status. The Banks required and actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands): Actual Required for Capital Adequacy Purposes Required to be WellCapitalized UnderPrompt CorrectiveAction Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio At December 31, 2005: Total Capital to Risk weighted assets $ 2,021,091 10.94 % &gt;$ 1,478,238 &gt;8.0 % &gt;$ 1,847,797 &gt; 10.0 % Tier I Capital to Risk weighted assets $ 1,957,805 10.60 % &gt;$ 739,119 &gt;4.0 % &gt;$ 1,108,678 &gt; 6.0 % Tier I Capital to Adjusted total assets $ 1,957,805 5.92 % &gt;$ 1,322,343 &gt;4.0 % &gt;$ 1,652,929 &gt; 5.0 % At December 31, 2004: Total Capital to Risk weighted assets $ 1,533,934 11.09 % &gt;$ 1,106,778 &gt;8.0 % &gt;$ 1,383,472 &gt; 10.0 % Tier I Capital to Risk weighted assets $ 1,486,422 10.74 % &gt;$ 553,389 &gt;4.0 % &gt;$ 830,083 &gt; 6.0 % Tier I Capital to Adjusted total assets $ 1,486,422 5.83 % &gt;$ 1,019,659 &gt;4.0 % &gt;$ 1,274,574 &gt; 5.0 % The Bank is also required by OTS regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of tangible assets. The Bank satisfied this requirement at both December 31, 2005 and 2004. 46 Table of Contents Brokerage subsidiaries are prohibited from paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2005, all of our brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum required net capital requirements. Share Repurchases and Debt Retirements The Companys Board of Directors (the Board) authorizes share repurchase and debt retirement plans, as they determine that they are likely to create long term value for our shareholders. In 2004, the Board authorized the April 2004 Plan and the December 2004 Plan. Under these plans, we may repurchase common stock or retire convertible subordinated notes. In 2005, we repurchased an aggregate of $58.2 million in common shares. More information about the April 2004 and the December 2004 repurchase plans can be found in Item 5 on page 16. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands): Due in Thereafter Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Security commitments to: Purchase securities $ 882,135 $ $ $ $ $ $ 882,135 Sell securities (950,762 ) (950,762 ) Loan commitments to: Originate loans(1) 362,203 362,203 Purchase loans 112,452 112,452 Sell mortgages (35,087 ) (35,087 ) Equity funding commitments(2) 18,297 18,707 8,332 45,336 Acquisition related commitments 3,400 3,400 Certificates of deposit(3)(4) 2,423,817 426,882 177,405 76,380 89,550 126,797 3,320,831 Other borrowings by Bank subsidiary(5) 11,931,620 872,852 142,648 287,601 185,705 2,814,914 16,235,340 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities(5) 24,042 24,042 24,042 24,042 24,042 851,068 971,278 Convertible and senior notes(5) 151,013 330,647 139,722 139,204 139,155 2,371,968 3,271,709 Facilities offered for sublease, less estimated future sublease income(6) 8,366 6,476 4,860 4,075 2,255 140 26,172 Operating lease payments 27,503 26,872 25,374 22,397 19,753 27,596 149,495 Total contractual obligations (7) $ 14,958,999 $ 1,706,478 $ 522,383 $ 553,699 $ 460,460 $ 6,192,483 $ 24,394,502 (1) Contains optional commitments to originate.

Transactions including the opening of an account, processing of a trade, acceptance of a deposit, hiring a new employee and acquiring a company, all involve a certain amount of risk. The identification and management of risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. We do not believe that risks can be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed to within the Companys risk tolerance. We manage risk through a governance structure involving the Board, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed with our desired risk profile. The Corporate Risk Committee, consisting of senior management executives, monitors risks throughout the Company. In addition to this committee, various departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and risk management. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from an adverse change in a borrowers ability to repay their loan. Loan and margin advances are underwritten based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and the fair market value of the underlying collateral, taking into consideration any events that may affect the value of that collateral. The level of credit risk in an individual loan will vary depending on the credit characteristics of the borrower, the magnitude of the transaction and the quality of the collateral, in addition to the terms of the transaction. These risks are monitored at the Bank level by the Credit Risk Management Committee. The Credit Risk Management Committee is responsible for the overall credit risk management of the Bank. This committee reports to the Asset Liability Management Committee. The credit risk management process encompasses the entire underwriting and review process from comprehensive credit policies to loan review and regulatory exams. The Credit Risk Management Committee reviews detail risk measurement and modeling results, and monitors the loan audit review process. We conduct independent reviews of the underwriting process for originated and purchased loans. The Credit Risk Management Committee regularly reviews the results of those reviews. In addition, regulatory examiners review and perform detailed tests of our credit underwriting, loan administration and allowance process. The Credit Risk Management Committees duties include monitoring asset quality trends, evaluating market conditions including residential real estate markets, determining the adequacy of the allowance, establishing underwriting standards, approving large credit exposures, approving large portfolio purchases and delegating credit approval authority. The Credit Risk Management Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and routinely reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate. The section below includes some of the information reviewed by the committee in determining asset quality and the level of adequacy of the allowance. In addition to the Banks Credit Risk Management Committee, brokerage margin receivables are monitored by brokerage management. These receivables are evaluated to determine if the margin loans have sufficient collateral, that is the value of the securities held as collateral are sufficient to cover the margin receivable balance. In addition, brokerage management monitors situations where trades have occurred and payment was not received due to fraud or returned checks and other electronic transaction rejects. These situations are rare but do occasionally occur. 48 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the Bank Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO.) The Asset Liability Management Committee reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal control process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from advertising to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof. The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial losses and reputation risks. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships. Third party vendor arrangements are screened by the Legal department and are overseen by the Vendor Risk Management group. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conducted financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers. Fraud losses result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We have a sophisticated system that monitors customer transaction and identifies the most fraudulent transactions before they occur. However, the world is a changing place and new techniques are constantly being developed by both the perpetrators to commit fraud and our efforts to stop fraud. We are one of the few in the industry that offers customers digital security tokens. Digital security tokens work in conjunction with a password. The tokens display a number that changes every 60 seconds. The number on the display and a password must be used together to access the customers account. This system makes fraudulent entry into a customers account virtually impossible. This security system is part of our efforts to mitigate fraudulent transactions and entry into customer accounts. Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss or actual losses depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from inadequate staffing, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in opportunity or actual losses could include the failure of a competitor to meet its customers needs, Internet performance issues, legal, reputation, public policy and strategic risks. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. 49 Table of Contents Allowances for Loan Losses and Uncollectible Margin Loans Description The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for loan losses was $63.3 million on $19.5 billion of loans designated as held for investment. In addition to our banking loans, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin loans. At December 31, 2005, margin accounts had approximately $5.7 billion in outstanding margin loans for which we provided an allowance for uncollectible margin loans of $8.8 million. Judgments The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge off and loss experience, current industry charge off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Effects if Actual Results Differ Although we have considerable experience in performing these reviews, if managements underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or significant unanticipated changes to the national or regional economies occur, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. If our estimates understate probable losses inherent in the portfolio, this would result in additional expense. A 10% increase or decrease in the allowances would result in a $7.2 million charge or credit to income, respectively. Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments Description We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans and securities, net for our banking investments and gain on sale and impairment of investments for our brokerage (other than those held for market making purposes) and corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized $40.3 million, $18.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively, of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Judgments When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. For illiquid securities, fair value is estimated by obtaining market price quotes on similar liquid securities and adjusting the price to reflect differences. For securities where market quotes and similar securities are not available, we use discounted cash flows. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing 50 Table of Contents losses based on market conditions and other factors. Other than temporary impartment is recorded based on management judgment. Management evaluates securities based on market conditions and all available information about the issuer or underlying collateral. This information is used to determine if impairment is other than temporary. The determination that impairment is other than temporary is judgmental. Based on the facts and circumstances, companies could have different conclusions regarding when securities are other than temporarily impaired. Impairment of mortgage backed or asset backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security meets both criterion, we write the security down to fair value in the current period. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. Effects if Actual Results Differ Earnings could be influenced by the timing of managements decisions to recognize a security as other than temporarily impaired. Our estimates are based on the best available information. Over time additional information may become available and may influence future write downs. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized book were written down, a $302.4 million charge would occur. Management believes that its estimates of other than temporary impairment are supportable and reasonable. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding securities. Valuation and Accounting for Financial Derivatives Description The Banks principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are customer deposits and other short term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long term and short term interest rates and to convert fixed rate assets or liabilities to variable rates. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. Substantially all derivatives held on December 31, 2005 were designated as hedges. As of December 31, 2005, we had derivative assets of $152.5 million and derivative liabilities of $38.1 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had derivative assets of $115.9 million and derivative liabilities of $52.2 million. Judgments Hedge accounting is very complex and involves the interpretation of a vast amount of accounting literature. From time to time, new interpretations are issued, which result in new accounting methods applied to existing and new transactions. The implementation of SFAS No. 133 involves numerous judgments and Company level interpretations. We must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. Judgment is necessary to determine the accounting for our hedging strategies. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our 51 Table of Contents reported results would be significantly affected. Revised accounting interpretations of existing literature could materially impact our financial results. If 10% of the fair value of derivatives classified in liabilities were determined to relate to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the adjustment would reduce income by $3.8 million before taxes. Similarly, if 10% of the fair value of derivatives included in assets were determined to not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the result would be $15.2 million in additional pre tax income. The most significant effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment is the earnings volatility that would be created by marking the derivatives to market as interest rates change. Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances Description In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and required reserves for potential tax deficiencies and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statements of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. Our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $3.9 million and $41.1 million, respectively, net of a valuation allowance of $39.4 million and $52.7 million, respectively. Judgments Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, resolution with taxing authorities of issues with previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Effects if Actual Results Differ These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Description We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2005 was $2.0 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2005 were $532.1 million, which have useful lives between three and thirty years. Judgments In 2005, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill with the assistance of a third party. This evaluation indicated that no impairment charges were necessary. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives on 52 Table of Contents intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If managements estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occurs, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized. Valuation and Expensing of Share Based Payments Description We value and expense employee share based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R.) We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each periods compensation expense attributed to these options. Judgments We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are managements best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of employees forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10 basis point change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by 7%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods.

The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest earning banking assets and the interest incurred on our interest bearing banking liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous years average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous years volume.

(2) Preferred stock in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, no stated maturity date Deposits and Other Sources of Funds In 2003, we introduced the SDA. The SDA is a sweep product that transfers brokerage customer balances, previously held in money market funds not on our balance sheet, to the Bank. The Bank carries these balances as customer deposits in FDIC insured money market accounts. The Balance Sheet Overview begins on page 37 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information about the Banks deposits, including the range of interest rates paid on deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits, including certificates of deposits of $100,000 or more. Borrowings Deposits represent a significant component of our current funds. In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements. We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. In part, the FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances on the security of FHLB stock and various home mortgages and other assets principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2005, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $3.9 billion at interest rates ranging from 2.53% to 6.96% and at a weighted average rate of 4.09%. We also raise funds by selling securities to nationally recognized investment banking firms under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The investment banking firms hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed and variable rate securities. We also participate in 59 Table of Contents the Federal Reserve Banks special direct investment and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, we currently evaluate such risks for our brokerage and banking operations separately. The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily related to interest earning assets and sources of funds. Interest Rate Risk The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable and fixed assets, liabilities and derivatives in a way that reduces the overall exposure to changes in interest rates. This analysis is based on complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates including the following could impact interest income and expense: Interest bearing assets and liabilities may re price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch. The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short and long term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income. Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize. Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution of interest bearing assets, liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2005, 92% of our total assets were interest earning. Approximately 80% of interest earning assets are variable meaning that they re price periodically based on market interest rates. At December 31, 2005, approximately 58% of our total assets were residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment. Our liability structure consists of brokerage payables, transactional deposit relationships, such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and long term notes. Our transactional deposit accounts tend to be less rate sensitive then other deposit account types. Brokerage payables, agreements to repurchase securities and money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and long term notes generally have fixed rates. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolios, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates, while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates. 61 Table of Contents Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the Net Present Value of Equity (NPVE) approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and then combined to produce a NPVE figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up 100, 200 and 300 basis points and down 100 and 200 basis points. The NPVE method is used at the Bank level and not for the consolidated Company. The Bank has 79% and 84% of our interest earning assets and holds 77% and 85% of our interest bearing liabilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest earning assets not included in the NPVE approach are floating rate brokerage receivables and a small portfolio of trading securities. Interest bearing liabilities not currently included in the analysis consist of brokerage payables and corporate level long term debt. The sensitivity of NPVE at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the limits established by the Banks Board of Directors are listed below (dollars in thousands): Change in NPVE At December 31, Board Limit Parallel Change in Interest Rates (bps) 2005 2004 +300 $ (490,045 ) (22 )% $ (158,207 ) (9 )% (55 )% +200 $ (298,476 ) (13 )% $ (69,671 ) (4 )% (30 )% +100 $ (115,244 ) (5 )% $ (2,321 ) % (20 )% 100 $ (49,256 ) (2 )% $ (149,651 ) (9 )% (20 )% 200 $ (382,924 ) (17 )% * * (30 )% * The Interest Rate Risk for down 200 is not presented as of December 31, 2004 because the OTS did not require the Bank to monitor this information as of that date. Under criteria published by the OTS, the Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at December 31, 2005 was characterized as moderate. We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will readjust our strategy and mix of assets, liabilities and derivatives to optimize its position. For example, a 100 basis points increase in rates may not result in a change in value as indicated above. The Banks Asset Liability Committee monitors the Banks position. Mortgage Production Activities Our current strategy is to hold loan production on the balance sheet, thus the current period impact resulting from exposure to mortgage production activity risks have declined. However, holding mortgage assets on the balance sheet involves similar risks. We are exposed to changing interest rates between the commitment and funding dates. The most significant mortgage loan risk is prepayment risk. The cost to originate a mortgage loan can be significant. When mortgage loans prepay, these costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, these write offs may result in a lower than anticipated yields. The Asset Liability Committee reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on loan production volumes and prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy. For mortgage loans intended to be sold, Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLC) are considered derivatives with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. IRLC are commitments issued to borrowers that lock in an interest rate now for a loan closing in one to three months. These locks initially recorded with a fair value of zero will fluctuate in value of the lock period as market interest rates change. There were $0.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2004 in mortgage loan commitments awaiting funding. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, IRLC were valued at $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. 62 Table of Contents Equity Security Risk Equity securities risk is the risk of potential loss from investing in public and private equity securities. We hold equity securities for investment purposes and in trading securities for market making purposes. For investment purposes, we currently hold publicly traded equity securities, in which we had unrealized gains of $94.7 million as of December 31, 2005. As each securitys market price fluctuates, we are exposed to risk of a loss with respect to these unrealized gains. Our investments in Softbank Investment Corporation (SBI) and Investmart also expose us to foreign currency exchange risk. These investments are less than 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2005. Trading Securities We hold $146.7 million and $593.2 million in trading securities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Trading securities unlike most of our assets are marked to market through earnings. For liquidity purposes at the Bank level, we maintain a trading portfolio of investment grade securities. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the non equity trading portfolio has fair values of $125 million and $567 million, respectively. In addition, we make a market in certain equity securities. We held as trading for market making purposes, a fair value of $20.2 million and $8.3 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our market making activities are primarily in certain exchange traded and over the counter securities on the CHX. The market risk from this business is monitored by the Asset Liability Committee who has established specific guidelines for an acceptable level of risk. 63 Table of Contents
