ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. GLOSSARY OF TERMS In analyzing and discussing our business, we utilize certain metrics, ratios and other terms that are defined in the Glossary of Terms, which is located at the end of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Strategy Our strategy centers on strengthening and growing our retail business and leveraging that growth in our institutional business. We strive to further develop our retail business by acquiring, expanding and retaining our relationships with global retail customers. We offer our retail and institutional customers a suite of investing, trading, banking and lending products. We plan to grow those relationships organically by using technology to deliver an attractive combination of product, service and price to the value driven mass affluent customer. We also intend to grow, where appropriate, through targeted acquisitions which leverage our existing business platform and through further expansion into certain international markets. As we expand our global customer base, and increase the retail customer cash and credit products we hold on our balance sheet, we believe that our business will benefit. As our institutional business manages our balance sheet on an enterprise wide basis, we become less dependent on revenue from market driven customer trading activity, and our income, while still positioned to benefit from a strong equity market, becomes more recurring in nature. As a result, net operating interest income has become our leading category of revenue, and we anticipate this trend will continue. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; competitors pricing on financial products and services; interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve; and the performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers; deepening customer acceptance of our investing, trading, banking and lending products, including E*TRADE Complete; disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency; maintaining strong overall asset quality; and prudent risk and capital management. 19 Table of Contents Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: At or For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 Customer Activity Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 194.9 $ 177.9 $ 100.0 10 % Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 28.2 $ 18.7 19 % Daily average revenue trades 159,348 97,740 83,643 63 % Average commission per trade $ 12.05 $ 13.82 $ 15.63 (13 )% Products per customer 2.1 2.1 1.9 0 % Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth(2) 42 % 15 % 10 % 27 % Enterprise net interest spread (basis points) 285 249 229 14 % Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 45.4 $ 32.4 $ 26.2 40 % Operating margin (%) 41 % 38 % 33 % 3 % Compensation and benefits as a % of revenue 19 % 22 % 24 % (3 )% (1) Customer cash and deposits, as well as retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005 which reduced both metrics by $564 million. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these items on our balance sheet. (2) Revenue growth is the difference between the current and prior comparable period total net revenue divided by the prior comparable period total net revenue. Customer Activity Metrics Retail client assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in retail client assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and a key driver of net operating interest income. Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers. Average commission per trade is impacted by the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders, mass affluent and main street customers. This metric is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. Products per customer is an indicator of our customer engagement and how well our suite of products and services appeal to our customer base. We believe increases to this measure represent better overall customer engagement with our products and services. Company Financial Metrics Net revenue growth is an indicator of our overall financial well being and our ability to execute on our strategy. When coupled with operating margin, the two provide information about the general success of our business. Enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Enterprise interest earning assets are an indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income, and growth in these assets, in conjunction with net operating interest spread, indicates our ability to grow net operating interest income. 20 Table of Contents Operating margin is an indicator of the profitability of our operations. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of our productivity. In recent periods, we have grown our revenue faster than our compensation expense. This ratio coupled with operating margin is an indictor of our increasing efficiency. Significant Events in 2006 Harrisdirect and BrownCo Customer Conversions We converted Harrisdirect and BrownCo customers to the E*TRADE Financial platform in the first and second quarters of 2006, respectively, which was a key step in the integration of our newly acquired customer base. This allowed us to deliver our functionality and services to these customers while reducing the costs associated with maintaining the legacy platforms. Enhancements to the Complete Investment Account We launched a series of functionality enhancements to the E*TRADE Complete Investment Account designed to help retail customers optimize their investing and borrowing relationships while evaluating their portfolio risk, including the Intelligent Lending Optimizer and the Intelligent Investing Optimizer and Risk Analyzer. We believe these new free tools will help customers better manage their security holdings, cash and credit products. Enhanced Distribution Network We enhanced our distribution network by opening eight new E*TRADE Financial centers in the United States during the period. With the addition of the centers in Seattle, WA; Farmington, MI; Garden City, NY; Torrance, CA; King of Prussia, PA; Roseville, CA; Fort Lauderdale, FL; and Scarsdale, NY, we increased the number of our nationwide financial centers to a total of 24. E*TRADE Complete Savings Account We launched the E*TRADE Complete Savings Account, which allows customers to quickly and easily take advantage of investment opportunities by offering a competitive annual percentage yield, no minimums in balances or account fees and free transfers to any institution. Acquired RAA We completed the purchase of RAA, a Dallas, Texas based investment advisor managing over $1 billion in assets, in the third quarter of 2006. We believe this acquisition strengthens our regional advisor business, which delivers localized wealth management services and advice to retail clients with a minimum of $250,000 in assets. The growth of our wealth management business extends our ability to provide customers with the complete support they are demanding to address their varied financial needs. Launch of New E*TRADE Website We launched a new and improved website at www.etrade.com. The new site features intuitive navigation, demonstrations of some of our most popular products and tools, direct access to account opening and customer service on every page and quick access to our powerful quotes and research functionality. Development of Automated Trading Strategies Functionality We developed new conditional orders functionality for retail customers including trailing stops for options and group orders such as contingent, one cancels all, one triggers all and one trigger one cancels other orders. 21 Table of Contents When combined with the conditional order functionality already available to customers, such as trailing stops and bracketed orders for stocks, we believe this functionality will allow our customers to better manage risk. Move of Exchanges to the NASDAQ On December 27, 2006 we moved the listing of the Companys common stock from the NYSE to the NASDAQ under the symbol ETFC. We made this move to demonstrate our commitment to our customers and shareholders by aligning ourselves with the market that best meets their needs. As an industry innovator, NASDAQs value proposition parallels our own, leveraging technology to provide customers with low fees, superior service and fair, efficient and transparent market access and execution. Increased Ownership of Investsmart We increased our ownership stake in Investsmart. Investsmart is an India based financial services organization providing individuals and corporations with customized financial management solutions. As a result, because we now meet the criteria required to exercise significant influence, we account for Investsmart as an equity method investment. Upgraded Credit Rating Three credit agencies, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys), S&P and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating during 2006. During the second quarter of 2006, Moodys upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from B1 to Ba2 and the long term deposit rating of E*TRADE Bank from Ba2 to Baa3. During the third quarter of 2006, S&P upgraded our rating to BB (stable) from B+ (positive) and DBRS upgraded our rating by two increments to BB (high) from BB (low). DBRS also upgraded the long term deposit rating of E*TRADE Bank to BBB (low) from BB. We believe that our improved profitability and the diversity of our business model were key factors in receiving these upgrades and that these upgrades are an important acknowledgement of the progress we have made as a company. Significant Events in 2005 Acquisition of Harrisdirect and BrownCo We completed our acquisitions of two online discount brokerage companies, Harrisdirect and BrownCo, in the fourth quarter of 2005. At the time of the acquisitions, the companies had approximately $69.0 billion in customer assets including $8.5 billion in customer cash, margin debt of approximately $0.9 billion and brokerage receivables of approximately $3.1 billion. Harrisdirect was purchased for approximately $709 million in cash from Harris Financial Corp, a subsidiary of BMO Financial Group. As part of the financing to acquire Harrisdirect, we issued $450 million in fixed rate senior notes. BrownCo was purchased for approximately $1.6 billion in cash from JPMorgan Chase & Co. As part of the financing to acquire BrownCo, we issued $550 million fixed rate senior notes, $650 million in common stock and $450 million in face value of mandatory convertible notes. The common stock was sold in the market and proceeds were used for the BrownCo acquisition. Acquisition of Wealth Management Advisors We acquired two wealth management advisors, Kobren Insight Management, Inc. (Kobren) and Howard Capital Management, Inc. (Howard Capital) during 2005. These companies provide advisory and asset management services to retail clients. On a combined basis, these companies managed $1.5 billion in customer assets. The growth of our wealth management business extends our ability to provide customers with the complete support they are demanding to address their varied financial needs. 22 Table of Contents Dispositions We sold our Consumer Finance Corporation business, exited our institutional proprietary trading business and made a decision to sell our professional agency business, ultimately executing a sale agreement in February 2006. The Consumer Finance Corporation business originated and serviced recreational vehicles and marine loans. We retained the loan portfolio; however, we no longer originate or service recreational vehicle or marine loans. Introduction of E*TRADE Complete We launched E*TRADE Complete, which offers consumers tools to aid in the optimization of investing, cash management and lending products. E*TRADE Complete tools initially included the Cash Optimizer, the Intelligent Investing Optimizer and the Intelligent Lending Optimizer. Customers can quickly transfer funds to modify deposit balances to determine the optimal distribution of cash between accounts based on their personal preferences. Each customers product selection and mix will depend on their price, liquidity, convenience and risk tolerance preference. The Intelligent Investing Optimizer makes it easy to develop an investment strategy for a customers uninvested cash targeted to specific goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. It also suggests allocations for large cap, small cap, international investment, fixed income and cash. The Intelligent Lending Optimizer is a tool that allows customers to model multiple lending scenarios to determine whether they can lower their borrowing costs. Customers can use E*TRADE Complete in conjunction with our other retail products. Introduction of Token Based Security We began offering a token based security solution to our U.S. based retail customers on a voluntary basis. Using a token based security solution provides an added layer of security at their point of access to the Internet to safeguard their personal financial information. The tokens produce a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds and is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. We believe comprehensive security protection is important to financial consumers and our token based security solution gives us a competitive edge in this area. Introduction of the E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee We developed the E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee, which was launched in January 2006. Our promise to customers is that we will cover certain losses that result from the unauthorized use of our products and services, subject to certain limitations. Under our Complete Payment Protection Guaranty, we ensure that customer payments and transfers are processed exactly as the customer desired. In the unlikely event that any customer payment or transfer is not sent as instructed, we will work with the customer to swiftly resolve the issue and reimburse the customer in full for any late fees, penalties or related finance charges incurred. In addition, under the Complete Privacy Protection Guaranty, we assure our customers that we will undertake our best efforts to maintain their privacy and will not sell personal information to third parties or marketers for any purpose. Enhanced Pricing Structure We changed our pricing structure to reward customers for holding assets with us and to align our structure with the competitive marketplace. The table below shows our pricing as of December 31 for each period: Customer Segment Base Pricing in 2005 and 2006 Base Pricing in 2004 Active Trader $6.99 to $9.99 per trade $9.99 per trade Mass Affluent $9.99 per trade $12.99 per trade Main Street Investor $12.99 per trade $19.99 per trade We changed our customer segment definitions and lowered our fees charged in February 2005 and October 2005. In addition to the fee schedule above, we have grandfathered certain trade pricing for customers acquired through our Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions. 23 Table of Contents Change in Reporting Structure In January 2005, we revised our financial reporting to better reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker assesses our performance and makes resource allocation decisions. As a result, in 2005, we began reporting our operating results in two segments, retail and institutional, rather than our former brokerage and banking segments. For our retail segment, the realignment integrated the management and operations of investing, trading, cash management and lending product and service offerings, including margin receivable activities, and stock plan administration products and services for the retail customer. For our institutional segment, the realignment integrated the management and operations of balance sheet management, market making and global execution and settlement services businesses, with a focus on creating greater integration within our institutional segment and stronger leverage of our retail segment. Summary Financial Results Income Statement Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Total net revenue $ 2,420.3 $ 1,703.8 42 % Net income $ 628.9 $ 430.4 46 % Diluted net earnings per share $ 1.44 $ 1.12 29 % Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses $ 1,355.1 $ 817.1 66 % Operating margin $ 1,000.8 $ 649.8 54 % Operating margin (%) 41 % 38 % 3 % During the year ended December 31, 2006, we continued to strengthen our operating and financial performance. Total net revenue increased 42% and net income increased 46% when compared to 2005. We believe this increase was driven both by our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as by our ability to grow customer cash and deposits, loans (including margin receivables) and DARTs. The growth in customer cash and deposits and total enterprise interest earning assets, including margin receivables, were the primary drivers of our increase in net operating interest income, and the growth in DARTs was the primary driver of our increase in commission revenue. We were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 41% from 38% when compared to the prior year. We believe this growth in operating margin reflects increasing efficiencies in our operations. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 66% to $1,355.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005 and now represents 56% of total net revenue. Net operating interest income benefited from increases in customer cash and deposits coupled with growth in enterprise interest earning assets. Customer cash and deposits, our lowest cost sources of funds, increased $5.4 billion compared to 2005. The increase in customer cash and deposits resulted from organic growth, which we believe is a result, in part, of the Intelligent Cash Optimizer within E*TRADE Complete, which continues to drive growth in customer cash and deposit balances. 24 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions) December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Total assets $ 53.7 $ 44.6 21 % Total enterprise interest earning assets $ 49.9 $ 41.1 22 % Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets(1) 64 % 56 % 8 % Average retail deposits and free credits as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities(1) 62 % 53 % 9 % (1) The table data on average enterprise interest earning assets, loans, net and margin receivables, retail deposits and free credits has been prepared on the same basis as our disclosures with respect to the Bank under the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies. The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to increases of $7.1 billion in loans, net and $1.2 billion in available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities. The increase in loans, net was due principally to growth in our real estate loan portfolio. We continue to focus our efforts on growing our residential mortgage loan portfolios, including one to four family and home equity loans, and allowing our consumer loan portfolio to decline. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased by $13.0 billion in 2006 compared to 2005, which was related primarily to the increase in average loans, net and margin receivables. Retail deposits and free credits were $30.0 billion, up 41% or $8.7 billion during 2006. The increase related to the Harrisdirect conversion, as well as organic growth in checking, money market and certificate of deposit accounts. Retail deposits and free credits are two of our lowest cost sources of funding and are important contributors to our net operating interest income growth. In addition to acquired customer growth, we experienced organic growth which we believe is a result, in part, of the E*TRADE Complete Intelligent Cash Optimizer, as well as an overall focus on price, functionality and service for our global retail customers. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2006 Compared to 2005 Net income from continuing operations increased 40% to $626.8 million for 2006 compared to 2005. We experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in DARTs. We also experienced growth in customer margin balances. In addition, we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 41% in 2006 from 38% when compared to the prior year. We believe this growth in operating margin is reflective of increasing efficiencies in our operations. During 2006, we modified the format of our consolidated income statement to a format that we believe provides a clearer picture of our financial performance and is more consistent with the common presentation found in the financial services industry. We re ordered the revenue section by placing net operating interest income, which we previously referred to as net interest income, first, and non interest income second. In addition, we updated our expense presentation to eliminate the remaining bank/brokerage lines. In conjunction with this change, we created a new expense category, Clearing and servicing. This new category includes trade clearing related expense, previously included in Commissions, clearance and floor brokerage, and most expenses previously included in Servicing and other banking expenses. We also consolidated Fair value adjustments of financial derivatives into the Other expense category. Information related to fair value adjustments of financial derivatives is detailed in Note 9 Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a 25 Table of Contents clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking, lending and balance sheet management businesses. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been used primarily to finance acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo, and generally has not been downstreamed to any of our operating subsidiaries. Similarly, we report gain on sales and impairment of investments separately from gain on sales of loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain on sales of loans and securities, net are the result of activities in our operations, namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses. Gain on sales and impairment of investments relates primarily to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and is not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, expense excluding interest, other income (expense), income tax expense, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Revenue: Operating interest income $ 2,774,679 $ 1,650,264 $ 1,124,415 68 % Operating interest expense (1,374,647 ) (779,164 ) (595,483 ) 76 % Net operating interest income 1,400,032 871,100 528,932 61 % Provision for loan losses (44,970 ) (54,016 ) 9,046 (17 )% Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses 1,355,062 817,084 537,978 66 % Commission 625,265 458,834 166,431 36 % Service charges and fees 137,441 135,314 2,127 2 % Principal transactions 110,235 99,336 10,899 11 % Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 55,986 98,858 (42,872 ) (43 )% Other revenue 136,332 94,419 41,913 44 % Total non interest income 1,065,259 886,761 178,498 20 % Total net revenue $ 2,420,321 $ 1,703,845 $ 716,476 42 % 26 Table of Contents Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses continues to be our largest source of revenue and now represents 56% of total net revenue for 2006. This reflects our focus on retaining retail customer cash and deposits and retail credit balances. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which includes margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The table below presents each revenue component as a percentage of total net revenue. Year Ended December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Revenue: Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses 56 % 48 % 8 % Commission(1) 26 27 (1 )% Service charges and fees 6 8 (2 )% Principal transactions 4 6 (2 )% Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 2 6 (4 )% Other revenue 6 5 1 % Total net revenue 100 % 100 % % (1) Retail commission revenue represented 20% of total net revenue for both the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Institutional commission revenue represented 6% and 7% of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net Operating Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 66% to $1,355.1 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to growth in enterprise interest earning assets coupled with an increase in enterprise net interest spread. The growth in enterprise interest earning assets was driven by increases in both loans, net and margin receivables. The increase in enterprise net interest spread was driven by changes in our mix of lending and funding sources. Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 8% to 64% for 2006 compared to 2005. Average retail deposits and free credits as a percentage of average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 9% to 62% in 2006 compared to 2005. 27 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, and has been prepared on the same basis as our disclosures with respect to E*TRADE Bank under the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

(4) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.6 billion, $2.7 billion and $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE Financial, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. (5) Includes retail certificates of deposit including retail brokered certificates of deposit. (6) Includes institutional certificates of deposit. 28 Table of Contents Despite the flat to inverted yield curve during the period, enterprise net interest spread increased by 36 basis points to 2.85% in 2006, compared to 2005. This increase was primarily the result of our ability to grow low cost deposits and free credits during these periods, which in turn funded our growth in loans, net and margin receivables. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 40% to $45.4 billion for 2006, compared to 2005. Average loans, net and margin receivables grew 60% to $28.9 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. Average loans, net increased as a result of our focus on growing mortgage loan products. The margin receivable portfolio grew, in part, as a result of our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo, as well as organic growth. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 40% to $42.8 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily in low cost customer cash and deposits. Average retail deposits and free credits increased 64% to $26.7 billion for 2006 compared 2005. Increases in average retail deposits and free credits were driven by our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as by organic growth. Our interest rate risk is impacted by external factors such as the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve, the impact of the competitive environment on our pricing and customer behavior. We utilize interest rate derivatives to manage this risk. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Operating interest income: Operating interest income, gross $ 2,763,041 $ 1,662,745 $ 1,100,296 66 % Hedge income (expense) 11,638 (12,481 ) 24,119 * Operating interest income, net 2,774,679 1,650,264 1,124,415 68 % Operating interest expense: Operating interest expense, gross (1,361,170 ) (695,634 ) (665,536 ) 96 % Hedge expense (13,477 ) (83,530 ) 70,053 (84 )% Operating interest expense, net (1,374,647 ) (779,164 ) (595,483 ) 76 % Net operating interest income $ 1,400,032 $ 871,100 $ 528,932 61 % * Percentage not meaningful. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 17% to $45.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to a lower provision for our consumer loan portfolio in connection with the decline in the overall size of the consumer loan portfolio. We expect our provision to increase, however, as we grow our mortgage portfolio at a higher growth rate than the decline in the consumer loan portfolio. 29 Table of Contents Commission Retail and institutional commission revenue increased 36% to $625.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative numbers of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, ETFs, CFDs and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. DARTs increased 63% to 159,348 for 2006 compared to 2005. Our U.S. DART volume increased 65% from 2005, driven by both our acquisitions of BrownCo and Harrisdirect as well as organic customer growth and engagement. Our international DARTs grew by 53% compared to 2005, driven entirely by organic growth. Our international operations continue to be a strong growth contributor within our retail trading business, and we believe that over time it will become a significant component of our entire business. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs and now represent 13% of trading volume versus 10% a year ago. Average commission per trade decreased 13% to $12.05 for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period which resulted in a heavier weighting of Active Traders, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Service Charges and Fees Service charges and fees increased 2% to $137.4 million for 2006 compared to the 2005. The increase in service charges and fees for 2006 was due primarily to an increase in the advisory service fee income. This increase was offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees as our retail customers became more engaged and a greater number of customers exceeded the minimum activity levels required to avoid account maintenance fees. We expect our account maintenance fee income to continue to decline over time; however, we expect our advisory service fee income, which is not currently a significant portion of service charges and fees, to increase over time as we focus on growing this product. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 11% to $110.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in principal transactions resulted from higher trading volumes and market volatility which were offset slightly by a decrease in the average revenue earned per trade. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. 30 Table of Contents Gain on Sales of Loans and Securities, Net Gain on sales of loans and securities, net decreased 43% to $56.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Gain on sales of originated loans: Mortgage loans $ 11,834 $ 39,161 $ (27,327 ) (70 )% Consumer loans(1) 184 15,686 (15,502 ) (99 )% Gain on sales of originated loans 12,018 54,847 (42,829 ) (78 )% Loss on sales of loans held for sale, net (6,775 ) (1,208 ) (5,567 ) * Gain on sales of loans, net 5,243 53,639 (48,396 ) (90 )% Gain on sales of securities, net 50,743 45,219 5,524 12 % Gain on sales of loans and securities, net $ 55,986 $ 98,858 $ (42,872 ) (43 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Consumer loans originated by our retail segment are sold to our institutional segment at an arms length transfer price. The gains (losses) associated with our retail segment were reclassified to discontinued operations and the amounts related to our institutional segment remained in continuing operations. The decline in the total gain on sales of loans and securities, net during 2006 was due primarily to our lower sales of mortgage and consumer loans compared to 2005. We retained a greater number of originated mortgage loans on the balance sheet in an effort to retain the customer relationship and drive growth in net operating interest income. The decline in gain on sales of consumer loans was also due in part to the sale of our consumer finance business in 2005. The increase in gain on sales of securities, net resulted from higher security sales volumes in 2006 compared to 2005. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 44% to $136.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increases were the result of higher payment for order flow from improved option and equity trading volumes, offset by decreases in proprietary fund revenue relating to the closure of certain of our proprietary funds. In addition, other revenue includes foreign exchange margin revenue, stock plan administration products revenue and other revenue ancillary to our retail customer transactions. 31 Table of Contents Expense Excluding Interest The components of expense excluding interest and the year over year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 469,202 $ 380,803 $ 88,399 23 % Clearing and servicing 253,040 189,736 63,304 33 % Advertising and marketing development 119,782 105,935 13,847 13 % Communications 110,346 82,485 27,861 34 % Professional services 96,947 77,416 19,531 25 % Depreciation and amortization 73,845 74,981 (1,136 ) (2 )% Occupancy and equipment 85,568 69,089 16,479 24 % Amortization of other intangibles 46,220 43,765 2,455 6 % Facility restructuring and other exit activities 28,537 (30,017 ) 58,554 * Other 136,042 59,860 76,182 127 % Total expense excluding interest $ 1,419,529 $ 1,054,053 $ 365,476 35 % * Percentage not meaningful. Expense excluding interest increased 35% to $1,419.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by an increase in the number of employees in our service organization, higher trading volumes and loan balances, facility restructuring activities and an increase in fraud related losses. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 23% to $469.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This resulted primarily from a higher number of employees in our service organization, a full year impact of expensing stock options(1) and increased variable and incentive compensation expense. These increases in compensation are in line with the growth and performance of our business and our focus on enhancing customer service with additional representatives. We believe compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue is a measure of our efficiency and the most relevant metric to assess this increase. This ratio declined to 19% for 2006 from 22% for 2005. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 33% to $253.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was a result of higher trading volumes and higher loan balances during the period. Communications Communications expense increased 34% to $110.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to expenses associated with our newly acquired customers from Harrisdirect and BrownCo. In addition, we experienced higher variable expenses, such as quote services and trade confirmations, related to our increase in trading volume. Professional Services Professional services increased 25% to $96.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to third party support services, including technology and transitional service agreements, associated with our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo.  (1) In July 2005 we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Stock option expense was $22.1 million for 2006 and $13.7 for 2005. 32 Table of Contents Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility and restructuring costs were $28.5 million for 2006. During the year, we relocated certain functions out of the state of California. This expense represents certain facility costs as a result of ceasing operations at these locations in addition to severance charges for those employees to whom we communicated our plans and who were terminated as part of this relocation during the year. Other Other expenses increased 127% to $136.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were due primarily to a 212% increase in fraud related losses to $31.2 million for 2006 and the favorable settlement of the Nomura Securities, Inc. (Nomura) litigation, which reduced other expense by $35.0 million in 2005. The fraud related losses were primarily identity theft situations which arose from computer viruses that attacked the personal computers of our customers. We did not suffer from a breach of the security of our systems. We reimbursed customers for their losses through our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee. These fraud schemes have impacted our industry as a whole. While we believe our systems remain safe and secure, we have implemented technological and operational changes to deter unauthorized activity in our customer accounts. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) decreased to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006 compared to income of $26.3 million for 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Other income (expense): Corporate interest income $ 8,433 $ 11,043 $ (2,610 ) (24 )% Corporate interest expense (152,496 ) (73,956 ) (78,540 ) 106 % Gain on sales and impairment of investments 70,796 83,144 (12,348 ) (15 )% Loss on early extinguishment of debt (1,179 ) (1,179 ) * Equity in income of investments and venture funds 2,451 6,103 (3,652 ) (60 )% Total other income (expense) $ (71,995 ) $ 26,334 $ (98,329 ) * * Percentage not meaningful. Other expense for 2006 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the funding of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions beginning in late 2005. Offsetting corporate interest expense was $70.8 million in gain on sales and impairment of investments. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in SBI and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. (ISE) resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense from continuing operations increased 31% to $302.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in income tax expense was principally related to the increase in pre tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 32.5% compared to 34.0% for 2005. The decrease in the 2006 tax rate compared to the 2005 tax rate is primarily due to benefits recognized on state tax refunds filed in one of our jurisdictions as a result of recent favorable court decisions, a reversal of valuation allowance recorded in prior years related to international operations and a continued decrease in our overall effective state tax rate due to our changing geographic footprint. For additional information, see Note 19 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Our net gain (loss) from discontinued operations was $2.0 million for 2006. During 2006 and 2005, our discontinued operations included operating results from our professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC and we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million, net of tax, in 2006. In 2005, discontinued operations also included operating losses from our consumer loan origination business and our proprietary trading business E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, both of which were sold or discontinued during 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net income from continuing operations increased 17% to $446.2 million for 2005 compared to 2004. We experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in DARTs. We also experienced growth in customer margin balances. In addition, we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 38% in 2005 from 33% in 2004. Growth in revenues also was attributed to improved interest rate spread and net interest income from a larger balance sheet. The following sections describe in more detail the changes in key operating factors, and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, expense excluding interest, other income (expense), income tax expense, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. Revenue Net Operating Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 37% to $871.1 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to growth in enterprise interest earning assets coupled with an increase in enterprise net interest spread. The growth in enterprise interest earning assets was driven by increases in both loans, net and margin receivables. The increase in enterprise net interest spread was driven by changes in our mix of lending and funding sources. Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 10% to 56% for 2005 compared to 2004. Average retail deposits and free credits as a percentage of average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 6% to 53% 2005 compared to 2004. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased 42% to $54.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to growth in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, higher consumer loan related losses resulted from higher losses on recreational vehicle loans and higher credit card bankruptcy activity as a significant number of customers filed for personal bankruptcy before the enactment of the new bankruptcy laws in October 2005. Commission Commission revenue increased 6% to $458.8 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the executed trades between these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. Retail commission revenue increased $10.8 million for 2005 compared 2004 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. Average commission per trade decreased 12% to 34 Table of Contents $13.82 for 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease was primarily a function of increased market pressures, strategic pricing and the mix of customers. During 2005, growth in the Active Trader and Mass Affluent customer trading volumes outweighed Main Street Investors trading volumes, who generally have a higher commission per trade, contributing to our lower average commission per trade. Due to the factors described above, our 17% growth in DARTs for 2005 equated to a 3% increase in retail commission revenue during 2005 compared to 2004; however, our business model derives revenue not only from trades but also from other aspects of the relationship we have with our customers, especially those who maintain deposits, free credit and lending balances with us. Our average customer uses at least 2 products or services from our suite of retail products, which is the main driver in our diversification of revenue. For 2005, retail commission revenue represents 20% of total net revenue. Institutional commission revenue increased $16.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase reflects growth in wholesale trading. In early 2005, an institutional wholesale trading group was created to trade large blocks of stock for institutional customers. We provide institutional customers with global execution and settlement services, as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties, in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates, which differ by customer. Service Charges and Fees Service charges and fees increased 39% to $135.3 million for 2005 compared to the 2004. The increase in service charges and fees for 2005 was due primarily to an increase in the account service fees and advisory service fees. The increase in account service fees was due to an increase in account service fees charged beginning in the first quarter of 2005, from $25 to $40 per quarter for customers who did not meet certain criteria for balance and or activity levels. Advisory fees increased as a result of our acquisitions of investment advisory firms. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 22% to $99.3 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower market making volumes and market volatility. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the trading performance of our proprietary trading activities. Gain on Sales of Loans and Securities, Net Gain on sales of loans and securities, net decreased 30% to $98.9 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease was due primarily to lower gain on sales of originated mortgage loans. This was the result of an overall decline in mortgage industry volumes as interest rates continued to rise in 2005. Impairment losses of $38.3 million in 2005 related primarily to interest only securities and to a lesser extent certain investment securities. Impairment on certain interest only securities was the result of short term movements in interest rates. Impairments on investment securities were the result of credit losses in certain investment securities secured by manufactured housing loans. These impairments were not indicative of a specific issue with our investments, but rather an overall deterioration in the manufactured housing loan market. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 6% to $94.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increases were the result of increased options transaction fees and 12b 1 fees, offset by decreases in proprietary fund revenue relating to the closure of certain of our proprietary funds. In addition, other revenue includes foreign exchange margin revenue, stock plan administration products revenue and other revenue ancillary to our retail customer transactions. 35 Table of Contents Expense Excluding Interest Expense excluding interest increased 7% to $1,054.1 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by higher compensation and benefits expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), increased marketing for the launch of E*TRADE Complete and a larger balance sheet. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 9% to $380.8 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from $13.7 million in stock option expense. In July 2005 we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R) which requires the expensing of stock options. We believe compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue is a measure of our efficiency and the most relevant metric to assess this increase. This ratio declined from 24% for 2004 to 22% for 2005. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 17% to $189.7 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in servicing costs due to growth in our loan portfolio which increased 69% compared to 2004. Communications Communications expense increased 18% to $82.5 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to expenses associated with communications to our newly acquired customers from Harrisdirect and BrownCo. In addition, variable expenses such as quote services and trade confirmations increased with our increase in trading volume. Professional Services Professional services increased 12% to $77.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due primarily to third party support services, including technology and transitional service agreements, associated with our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Advertising and Marketing Advertising and marketing costs increased 70% to $105.9 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due primarily to marketing the launch of E*TRADE Complete, as well as an increase in acquisition related and customer retention marketing. Amortization of Other Intangibles Amortization of other intangibles increased 125% to $43.8 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in amortization expense was due primarily to the impairment of our OTC specialist book. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility and restructuring costs were a credit of $30.0 million for 2005. The credit resulted from a $35.5 million, pre tax gain recognized on the sale of the Consumer Finance Corporation servicing business, which was recorded as a facility restructuring cost as it did not qualify as a discontinued operation. Other Other expenses decreased 34% to $59.9 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of the Nomura litigation which reduced other expenses by $35.0 million. 36 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) decreased $42.4 million to income of $26.3 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This decrease was due primarily to lower gain on the sale and impairment of investments of $45.0 million and higher corporate interest expense of $26.4 million resulting from an increase in acquisition related senior notes in 2005, partially offset by the $23.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2004. During 2005, we sold shares of our investments in SBI, Archipelago Holdings, Inc., Ameritrade Holding Corporation and ISE resulting in gains of $82.7 million. During 2004, gain on sales and impairment of investments was related primarily to gain on sales of our investments in SBI in the amount of $130.6 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense from continuing operations increased $48.1 million or 26% for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in income tax expense was related to the increase in pre tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were 34.0% and 32.2%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2004 was due principally to tax benefits recognized in 2004 in connection with the sale of partnership interests which generated an excess tax basis adjustment and the closure of several open IRS tax issues. Discontinued Operations Our net gain (loss) from discontinued operations was a loss of $17.5 million for 2005 and a loss of $1.3 million for 2004. During 2005, our discontinued operations included operating results from our proprietary trading business E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, our professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC and the origination business of Consumer Finance Corporation. During 2004, our discontinued operations included operating results from E*TRADE Access. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change The cumulative effect of accounting change of $1.6 million after tax ($2.8 million pre tax) for 2005 resulted from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment, effective July 1, 2005, which required us to record compensation expense for stock options. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recorded compensation expense for restricted stock awards on a straight line basis over their vesting period. If an employee forfeited the award prior to vesting, we reversed out the previously expensed amounts in the period of forfeiture. As required upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we must base the accruals of compensation expense on the estimated number of awards for which the requisite service period is expected to be rendered. Actual forfeitures are no longer recorded in the period of forfeiture. The pre tax credit of $2.8 million in cumulative effect of accounting change represents the amount by which compensation expense would have been reduced in periods prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) for restricted stock awards outstanding on July 1, 2005 that are anticipated to be forfeited. 37 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW Retail Retail segment income increased 52% to $695.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 2004 Amount % Retail segment income: Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses $ 883,563 $ 445,124 $ 322,278 $ 438,439 98 % Commission 479,876 339,654 328,889 140,222 41 % Service charges and fees 115,672 116,102 84,445 (430 ) (0 )% Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 36,698 63,705 93,694 (27,007 ) (42 )% Other revenue 138,316 112,836 106,457 25,480 23 % Net segment revenue 1,654,125 1,077,421 935,763 576,704 54 % Total segment expense 958,882 618,664 628,146 340,218 55 % Total retail segment income $ 695,243 $ 458,757 $ 307,617 $ 236,486 52 % Key Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 194.9 $ 177.9 $ 100.0 $ 17.0 10 % Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 28.2 $ 18.7 $ 5.4 19 % DARTs 159,348 97,740 83,643 61,608 63 % Average commission per trade $ 12.05 $ 13.82 $ 15.63 $ (1.77 ) (13 )% Average margin receivables (dollars in billions) $ 6.8 $ 2.8 $ 2.0 $ 4.0 143 % Products per customer 2.1 2.1 1.9 % (1) Total customer cash and deposits, as well as total retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005, which reduced both metrics by $564 million. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these line items on our balance sheet. Our retail segment generates revenue from investing, trading, banking and lending relationships with retail customers. These relationships essentially drive five sources of revenue including net operating interest income; commission; service charges and fees; gain on sales of loans and securities, net; and other revenue. This segment also includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we are ultimately servicing a retail customer through these corporate relationships. Our geographically dispersed retail accounts grew 3% from 2005 to 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3.6 million active trading and investing accounts and 0.8 million active lending and deposit accounts. The increase in retail segment income during 2006 compared to a year ago was due to an increase in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Retail net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 98% to $883.6 million for 2006 compared to 2005. Average margin receivables increased 143% to $6.8 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. Higher margin balances generally translate into a higher interest rate earned on interest earning assets. Customer cash and deposits increased 19% at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Higher customer cash and deposit balances generally translate into a lower cost of funds as deposits increased in comparison to other borrowings. Net operating interest income growth included the impact of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Retail commission revenue increased $140.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. The increase in DART volumes was the result of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions as well as strong organic growth in domestic equity, international equity and option trades. 38 Table of Contents A shift in the composition of our retail customers who traded during the year resulted in a 13% decrease in average commission per trade for 2006 compared to 2005. As a result, our 63% growth in DARTs for 2006 equated to a 41% increase in retail commission revenue for 2006; however, we derive revenue not only from trades but also from other aspects of our relationship with our customers, especially customers who maintain deposits and free credits with us. Our average customer uses at least 2 products or services from our suite of retail products, which is the main driver in our diversification of revenue. As such, while retail commission revenue increased 41% during 2006, total retail segment revenue increased 54%. Offsetting these increases were lower gains on the sales of loans and securities, net of $36.7 million for 2006. In addition, service charges and fees decreased $0.4 million for 2006 compared to 2005. Retail segment expense increased $340.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase for 2006 was related primarily to the $29.6 million restructuring charge, an increase in the compensation expense due to an increased number of employees in our service organization and increased fraud related losses. 2005 Compared to 2004 The 49% increase in retail segment income for 2005 compared to 2004 was due to an increase in net revenue driven primarily by an increase in net operating interest income, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. DARTs increased 17% in 2005 compared to 2004. While the increase in DARTs did not produce a corresponding increase in commission revenues, these customers did help drive the increase in cash deposits held in sweep deposit accounts. Retail net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 38% to $445.1 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was driven by an increase in both average enterprise interest earning assets and the net interest spread earned. Growth in average margin receivables was 40% to $2.8 billion in 2005 compared to 2004, including the impact of our acquisitions. Other key drivers of this increase in retail segment income were growth in the average balances of loans and deposits which increased 54% and 11%, respectively over last year. Service charges and fees increased by 37% in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to an increase in account service fees. Offsetting these positive variances were lower gains on the sale of loans and securities, net of $30.0 million due to the lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans and securities impairment. Institutional Institutional segment income increased 60% to $305.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 2004 Amount % Institutional segment income: Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses 471,499 372,122 274,743 99,377 27 % Commission 145,389 119,180 102,749 26,209 22 % Service charges and fees 21,769 19,212 13,130 2,557 13 % Principal transactions 110,235 99,175 126,893 11,060 11 % Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 19,288 35,153 47,024 (15,865 ) (45 )% Other revenue 9,269 10,383 16,684 (1,114 ) (11 )% Net segment revenue 777,449 655,225 581,223 122,224 19 % Total segment expense 471,900 464,190 393,041 7,710 2 % Total institutional segment income $ 305,549 $ 191,035 $ 188,182 $ 114,514 60 % Key Metrics: Total nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans, net 0.28 % 0.18 % 0.17 % 0.10 % Average revenue capture per 1,000 equity shares $ 0.373 $ 0.458 $ 0.341 $ (0.085 ) (19) % 39 Table of Contents Our institutional segment generates earnings from balance sheet management activities, market making and global execution and settlement services. Balance sheet management activities include purchasing loan receivables from the retail segment as well as third parties, and leveraging these loans and retail customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income. Retail trading order flow is leveraged by the institutional segment to generate additional revenue for the Company. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 27% to $471.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was primarily a result of growth in interest earning assets, which are funded primarily by retail customer cash and deposit balances. These customer balances were kept on balance sheet as a low cost source of funding and then utilized by the institutional segment either to purchase interest earning assets or pay down wholesale liabilities. Institutional commissions increased 22% to $145.4 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was due to a more favorable trading environment and the continued leveraging of our integrated institutional model with higher retail order flow. We provide institutional customers with global execution and settlement services, as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties, in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates, which differ by customer. The increase in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue was offset by a planned decrease in gain on sales of loans and securities, net of approximately $15.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. We evaluate our portfolio of securities available for sale in light of changing market conditions and where appropriate, take steps intended to optimize our overall economic position. During 2006, we determined that we would not sell securities at similar levels as 2005 because we focused on growing our balance sheet. Total institutional segment expense increased 2% to $471.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005 and was predominantly volume related. Compensation and benefits expense increased due to increases in variable and performance based compensation and expensing of stock options. Clearing and servicing expense increased due to increased overall trading volumes and the increase in our loan portfolio. 2005 Compared to 2004 The 2% increase in institutional segment income in 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable to a $74.0 million increase in net revenue offset by a $71.1 million increase in expenses. The increase in net revenue resulted from higher net operating interest income due to higher average balances of enterprise interest earning assets. The increase in the net operating interest income was partially driven by a shift from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans. The increase in expenses was driven by an increase in intangible amortization due to the impairment of our OTC Specialist Book, compensation and benefits expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and commissions due to an increase in overall trading volumes and higher servicing expenses related to an increase in loans serviced. 40 Table of Contents BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Assets: Cash and equivalents(1) $ 1,493,856 $ 1,454,362 3 % Trading securities 178,600 146,657 22 % Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 13,921,983 12,763,438 9 % Loans held for sale 283,496 87,371 224 % Brokerage receivables, net 7,636,352 7,174,175 6 % Loans receivable, net 26,372,697 19,424,895 36 % Other assets(2) 3,852,319 3,516,788 10 % Total assets $ 53,739,303 $ 44,567,686 21 % Liabilities and shareholders equity: Deposits $ 24,071,012 $ 15,948,015 51 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 9,792,422 11,101,542 (12 )% Brokerage payables 7,824,704 7,342,208 7 % Other borrowings 5,323,962 4,206,996 27 % Corporate debt(3) 1,842,169 2,022,701 (9 )% Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities 688,664 546,664 26 % Total liabilities 49,542,933 41,168,126 20 % Shareholders equity 4,196,370 3,399,560 23 % Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 53,739,303 $ 44,567,686 21 % (1) Includes balance sheet line items cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations. (2) Includes balance sheet line items property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and Other assets. (3) Includes balance sheet line items senior notes, mandatory convertible notes and convertible subordinated notes. During the period, we re aligned our balance sheet to consolidate several categories and changed the name of Other borrowings by Bank subsidiary to Other borrowings. Other borrowings include non Bank subsidiary term notes previously classified in Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities. Categories consolidated and related changes include: Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock was added to Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities; Derivative assets and Accrued interest receivable were added to Other assets; and Derivative liabilities was added to Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities. These categories were consolidated with other similar items in our balance sheet presentation. The notes to our consolidated financial statements continue to include detailed information about the individual items no longer listed on the face of the balance sheet. The 21% increase in total assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of growth in loans receivable, net and available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities. The growth in loans receivable, net was the result of our continued focus on growing our residential mortgage loan portfolios, including one to four family mortgages and home equity loans. The growth in available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities was due primarily to the growth in our asset backed securities portfolio. 41 Table of Contents The 20% increase in total liabilities at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 was attributable primarily to a $8.1 billion increase in deposits. The increase in deposits was due to higher sweep deposit accounts and money market deposits resulting, in part, from our conversion of Harrisdirect customers during the first quarter of 2006, as well as from organic growth from existing and new customers. The increase in deposits was partially offset by declines in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and corporate debt. The conversion of Harrisdirect customers to the E*TRADE Financial platform resulted in the transfer of customer brokerage receivables, deposits and customer brokerage payables from a third party provider to us. Customer brokerage receivables or margin receivables of $0.8 billion were transferred to our balance sheet. In addition, sweep deposit balances of $2.7 billion and brokerage payables, specifically free credits, of $1.3 billion were also moved to our balance sheet. Loans Receivable, Net Loans receivable, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Real estate loans: One to four family $ 10,870,214 $ 7,091,664 53 % Home equity lines of credit (HELOC), Home equity installment loans (HEIL) and other 11,809,008 8,106,820 46 % Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 2,292,356 2,692,055 (15 )% Marine 651,764 752,645 (13 )% Commercial 219,008 89,098 146 % Credit card 128,583 188,600 (32 )% Automobile 77,533 235,388 (67 )% Other 3,706 8,338 (56 )% Unamortized premiums, net 388,153 323,573 20 % Allowance for loan losses (67,628 ) (63,286 ) 7 % Total loans receivable, net $ 26,372,697 $ 19,424,895 36 % Loans receivable, net increased 36% to $26.4 billion at December 31, 2006 from $19.4 billion at December 31, 2005. We continue to focus our growth in real estate loans while allowing our consumer loans to decline. We anticipate that our mortgage and HELOC portfolios will continue to increase over time, and we believe this will improve our credit risk profile. We anticipate that recreational vehicle and marine loan balances will continue to decline over time due to our sale of Consumer Finance Corporation in 2005, and automobile loans will continue to decline due to our exit of the automobile origination business in 2004. Commercial loans increased 146% to $219.0 million at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. In general, we believe the 42 Table of Contents allowance for loan losses should be equal to at least twelve months of probable projected losses for all loan types. We believe this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands): Consumer & Other Real Estate Total Allowance Allowances as % of Consumer and OtherLoans Receivable Allowance Allowances as % of Real Estate Loans Receivable Allowance Allowances as % of Total Loans Receivable December 31, 2006 $ 28,197 0.82 % $ 39,431 0.17 % $ 67,628 0.26 % December 31, 2005 $ 32,379 0.80 % $ 30,907 0.20 % $ 63,286 0.32 % The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Allowance for loan losses, beginning of period $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 $ 19,874 Provision for loan losses 44,970 54,016 38,121 38,523 14,664 Allowance acquired through acquisitions(1) 1,547 2,748 14,428 Charge offs: Real estate (616 ) (936 ) (186 ) (364 ) (460 ) HELOC, HEIL and other (15,372 ) (3,929 ) (1,464 ) (75 ) Recreational vehicle (25,253 ) (20,592 ) (18,419 ) (20,341 ) (3,456 ) Marine (6,463 ) (8,009 ) (6,003 ) (7,369 ) Commercial Credit card (11,371 ) (17,286 ) (10,313 ) (919 ) Automobile (2,430 ) (5,915 ) (13,796 ) (22,695 ) (28,046 ) Other (338 ) (180 ) (160 ) (1,971 ) Total charge offs (61,843 ) (56,847 ) (50,341 ) (53,734 ) (31,962 ) Recoveries: Real estate 167 234 223 30 HELOC, HEIL and other 822 526 310 Recreational vehicle 11,959 7,848 9,088 9,738 Marine 4,091 3,960 3,225 3,806 Commercial Credit card 750 380 141 1 Automobile 3,285 5,382 7,464 8,335 10,632 Other 141 106 279 541 Total recoveries 21,215 18,436 20,507 22,644 10,662 Net charge offs (40,628 ) (38,411 ) (29,834 ) (31,090 ) (21,300 ) Allowance for loan losses, end of period $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 Net charge offs to average loans receivable, net outstanding 0.18 % 0.26 % 0.30 % 0.41 % 0.28 % (1) Acquisition of credit card portfolios in 2004 and 2003 and the Consumer Finance Corporation portfolio in 2002. 43 Table of Contents The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by loan category (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Real estate loans: One to four family $ 7,760 41.7 % $ 4,858 37.0 % $ 2,812 32.3 % $ 2,360 28.6 % $ 3,343 29.8 % HELOC, HEIL and other 31,671 45.3 26,049 42.3 15,183 31.9 3,302 19.1 851 6.8 Total real estate loans 39,431 87.0 30,907 79.3 17,995 64.2 5,662 47.7 4,194 36.6 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 11,077 8.8 13,465 14.1 11,343 22.4 11,386 28.3 9,480 24.8 Marine 3,648 2.5 4,590 3.9 4,116 6.3 2,503 7.9 3,108 8.4 Commercial 1,635 0.9 669 0.5 22 4 Credit card 10,611 0.5 11,714 1.0 9,078 1.8 5,583 1.4 Automobile 534 0.3 1,080 1.2 4,195 5.1 11,876 14.5 8,190 27.4 Other 692 861 932 0.2 833 0.2 2,694 2.8 Total consumer and other loans 28,197 13.0 32,379 20.7 29,686 35.8 32,185 52.3 23,472 63.4 Total allowance for loan losses $ 67,628 100.0 % $ 63,286 100.0 % $ 47,681 100.0 % $ 37,847 100.0 % $ 27,666 100.0 % (1) Represents percentage of loans receivable in category to total loans receivable, excluding premium (discount). Losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For first lien mortgages, a charge off is recognized when we foreclose on the property. For revolving loans, our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. During 2006, the allowance for loan losses increased by $4.3 million from the level at December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to growth in the real estate loan portfolio, which increased approximately $7.5 billion over the same period and is not indicative of a decline in our overall credit standards. The allowance increased by $8.5 million related to the growth of the real estate portfolio. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in the allowance for loan losses of $4.2 million related to the decline in the size of the consumer loan portfolio. Net charge offs for the year ended 2006 compared to 2005 increased by $2.2 million. The overall increase was due to higher net charge offs on real estate loans offset by lower net charge offs on consumer loans. The increase in real estate loan charge offs was due to the growth of the portfolio and the decrease in consumer loan charge offs was due primarily to a decline in loan balances as we exited the consumer finance business in 2005. Annualized net charge offs as a percentage of average loans receivable, net were 0.18% at December 31, 2006 compared to 0.26% at December 31, 2005. 44 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets We classify loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Real estate loans: One to four family $ 34,219 $ 18,067 $ 11,029 $ 18,094 $ 22,497 HELOC, HEIL and other 32,216 9,568 2,755 269 81 Total real estate loans 66,435 27,635 13,784 18,363 22,578 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 2,579 2,826 1,416 1,399 1,486 Marine 1,439 873 908 1,067 94 Commercial Credit card 3,795 2,858 2,999 2,147 Automobile 1,047 448 826 1,602 2,277 Other 46 14 22 16 53 Total consumer and other loans 8,906 7,019 6,171 6,231 3,910 Total nonperforming loans 75,341 34,654 19,955 24,594 26,488 Real estate owned (REO) and other repossessed assets, net 12,904 6,555 5,367 6,690 6,723 Total nonperforming assets, net $ 88,245 $ 41,209 $ 25,322 $ 31,284 $ 33,211 Total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans, net 0.28 % 0.18 % 0.17 % 0.27 % 0.36 % Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable(1) 90.52 % 186.24 % 281.55 % 187.61 % N/A (1) (1) This metric was changed to reflect the percentage of allowance for loan losses in relation to the total nonperforming loans receivable. In 2002, nonperforming loans were not tracked as held for investment versus held for sale; as such, this metric is not available. We expect nonperforming loan levels to fluctuate over time due to portfolio growth, portfolio seasoning and resolution through collections, sales or charge offs. The performance of any loan can be affected by external factors, such as economic conditions or factors particular to the borrower. During 2006, our nonperforming assets, net increased $47.0 million from $41.2 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was attributed to an increase in nonperforming real estate loans and REO and other repossessed assets, net of $45.1 million and an increase in nonperforming consumer and other loans of $1.9 million. These trends are not the result of a deterioration or improvement in credit quality, but are reflective of our targeted growth in real estate loans and the targeted decrease in consumer loans. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net decreased from 186% in 2005 to 91% in 2006. As our loan portfolio shifts to mortgage loans, where the risk of charge off is generally less than the risk of charge off on a consumer loan, the level of the allowance to nonperforming assets may continue to decrease. In addition to nonperforming assets in the table above, we monitor loans where a borrowers past credit history casts doubt on the borrowers ability to repay a loan, whether or not the loan is delinquent (Special Mention loans). Special Mention loans represented $261.5 million, or 1%, and $127.2 million, or 1%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These loans are actively monitored, continue to accrue interest and remain a component of the loans receivable balance. The increase in Special Mention loans was due primarily to an increase in the 30 day delinquency category of mortgage loans. Significant migration from this category to more serious delinquency classifications is not expected to occur. 45 Table of Contents Available for Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities Available for sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. government sponsored and Federal agencies $ 9,109,307 $ 9,427,521 (3 )% Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 1,108,385 995,891 11 % Total mortgage backed securities 10,217,692 10,423,412 (2 )% Investment securities: Asset backed securities 2,161,728 1,365,754 58 % Publicly traded equity securities: Preferred stock 458,674 288,365 59 % Corporate investments 24,139 147,400 (84 )% FHLB stock 244,212 198,700 23 % Other 815,538 339,807 140 % Total investment securities 3,704,291 2,340,026 58 % Total available for sale securities $ 13,921,983 $ 12,763,438 9 % Available for sale securities represented 26% and 29% of total assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Available for sale securities increased 9% to $13.9 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, due primarily to the growth in our asset backed securities portfolio. We evaluate our available for sale securities in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall position. We determined that we would not sell our mortgage backed and asset backed securities at similar levels as 2005 because we focused on growing our balance sheet. As interest rates increase, the fair value of fixed rate available for sale securities decreases and vice versa. The fair value of the portfolio will be adversely impacted in 2007 if long term interest rates continue to rise. Net unrealized gains and losses in available for sale securities are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Deposits Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Sweep deposit accounts $ 10,837,124 $ 7,733,267 40 % Money market and savings accounts 7,634,241 4,635,866 65 % Certificates of deposit(1) 4,737,253 2,703,605 75 % Brokered certificates of deposit(2) 483,777 484,612 (0 )% Checking accounts 378,617 390,665 (3 )% Total deposits $ 24,071,012 $ 15,948,015 51 % (1) Includes retail certificates of deposit including retail brokered certificates of deposit. (2) Includes institutional certificates of deposit. Deposits represented 49% and 39% of total liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deposits increased $8.1 billion to $24.1 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, driven by 46 Table of Contents a $3.1 billion increase in sweep deposit accounts, a $3.0 billion increase in money market and savings accounts and a $2.0 billion increase in certificates of deposit. The increase in sweep deposit accounts was driven primarily by the Harrisdirect and BrownCo conversions. Prior to the conversions, Harrisdirect customer cash balances were swept to a third party and not reflected on our balance sheet, and BrownCo customer cash balances were generally kept in free credits. Our other deposit products have shown significant growth as a result of our focused sales and retention efforts, as well as the overall impact of the E*TRADE Complete Intelligent Cash Optimizer. E*TRADE Complete Intelligent Cash Optimizer enables customers to better determine the optimal use of their funds and has resulted in higher money market and certificates of deposit balances. The sweep deposit accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives. The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $33.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Deposits $ 24,071,012 $ 15,948,015 $ 8,122,997 51 % Less: brokered certificates of deposit (483,777 ) (484,612 ) 835 0 % Deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit 23,587,235 15,463,403 8,123,832 53 % Free credits 6,368,749 5,770,751 597,998 10 % Customer cash balances held by third parties 3,633,783 6,955,830 (3,322,047 ) (48 )% Total customer cash and deposits $ 33,589,767 $ 28,189,984 $ 5,399,783 19 % The decrease in customer cash balances held by third parties was due primarily to the Harrisdirect conversion wherein cash from this account (which is off balance sheet) was converted to deposits and free credits (which is on balance sheet). Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 9,792,422 $ 11,101,542 (12 )% FHLB advances $ 4,865,466 $ 3,856,106 26 % Subordinated debentures 385,502 305,046 26 % Other 72,994 45,844 59 % Total other borrowings $ 5,323,962 $ 4,206,996 27 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 12% at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. During 2006, the Bank used these wholesale sources along with deposit growth to fund the increase in loans receivable. Other borrowings represented 11% and 10% of total liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase of $1.1 billion during 2006 was due primarily to an increase in FHLB advances. We actively manage our funding sources and determine the optimal mix based on pricing, liquidity and capacity during each period. 47 Table of Contents Corporate Debt Corporate debt decreased to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company called the remaining $185.2 million principal amount of its 6.00% convertible subordinated notes due February 2007 (6.00% Notes) during the year ended December 31, 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our liquidity and capital resources enable us to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions and grow our assets. Cash flows are derived from capital market activities and our operations in the retail and institutional segments. The segment cash flows provide capital to fund growth in our regulated subsidiaries. The Companys cash and equivalents balance increased to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. Changes in Cash and Equivalents In 2006, cash and equivalents at E*TRADE Financial Corporation, on a standalone holding company basis, increased $46.0 million to $139.5 million due primarily to a decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $2.2 billion offset by a decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion. The following significant activities and events impacting cash occurred during the year ended December 31, 2006: The acquisition of RAA for $15.3 million; and Repurchases of shares of common stock outstanding of $122.6 million. During the year ended 2006, the Company called the remaining $185.2 million principal amount of its 6.00% convertible subordinated notes due February 2007 (6.00% Notes). In April 2006, the Company completed the partial redemption that was originally announced in March 2006 and called the remaining $92.6 million principal amount of its 6.00% Notes. The table below shows the timing and impact of these calls (dollars and shares in millions): Debt Redeemed Common Stock Shares Issued Cash Paid First call in March 2006 March redemptions $ 36.3 1.5 $ April redemptions 56.3 2.4 0.9 Second call in April 2006(1) 92.6 3.9 0.9 Total redemptions $ 185.2 7.8 $ 1.8 (1) All redemptions occurred in April. Our current senior debt ratings are Ba2 (positive outlook) by Moodys Investor Service, BB (stable) by Standard & Poors and BB (high) by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS). The Companys long term deposit ratings are Baa3 by Moodys Investor Service, BB+ (stable) by Standard & Poors and BBB (low) by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, Inc. (Converging Arrows), is limited by regulatory requirements. Converging Arrows is a subsidiary of the parent company. At December 31, 2006, Converging Arrows had $107.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Converging Arrows is not restricted in its dealings with the parent company and may transfer funds to the parent company without regulatory approval. In addition to Converging Arrows, brokerage and banking subsidiaries may provide liquidity to the parent; however, they are restricted by regulatory guidelines. The Bank is prohibited by regulations from lending to the parent company. At December 31, 2006, the Bank had approximately $149.1 million of capital available for dividend declaration without regulatory approval while still maintaining well capitalized status. The Bank is also required by OTS regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of tangible assets. The Bank satisfied this requirement at December 31, 2006 and 2005. 48 Table of Contents The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 administered by the SEC, the NYSE and NASD, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, all of our brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $628.1 million at December 31, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Other Sources of Liquidity We maintain committed and uncommitted financing facilities with banks totaling $800.0 million to meet corporate liquidity needs and finance margin lending. There were no outstanding balances and the full $800.0 million was available under these lines at December 31, 2006 and 2005. We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to provide liquidity for the Bank. At December 31, 2006, the Bank had approximately $7.6 billion in additional borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Years ending December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Security commitments to: Purchase securities $ 3,611,937 $ $ $ $ $ $ 3,611,937 Sell securities (2,718,931 ) (2,718,931 ) Loan commitments to: Purchase loans 1,118,529 1,118,529 Originate loans(1) 456,630 456,630 Sell loans (60,282 ) (60,282 ) Equity funding commitments(2) 17,393 17,514 43 34,950 Acquisition related commitments(3) 1,250 1,250 Certificates of deposit(4)(5) 4,496,319 388,397 187,764 130,218 128,453 118,313 5,449,464 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings(5) 11,590,124 1,154,323 252,489 226,331 125,391 3,714,084 17,062,742 Convertible and Senior notes(6) 136,062 135,905 135,438 135,438 615,438 1,712,578 2,870,859 Facilities offered for sublease, less estimated future sublease income(7) 11,743 5,542 5,059 3,012 71 68 25,495 Operating lease payments 38,478 36,315 30,874 28,348 21,184 75,414 230,613 Purchase Obligations(8) 74,141 14,574 3,219 2,264 1,833 96,031 Total contractual obligations(9) $ 18,773,393 $ 1,752,570 $ 614,886 $ 525,611 $ 892,370 $ 5,620,457 $ 28,179,287 (1) Contains optional commitments to originate.

We may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. RISK MANAGEMENT As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. Transactions including the opening of an account, processing of a trade, acceptance of a deposit, hiring a new employee and acquiring a company, all involve a certain amount of risk. The identification and management of risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. We do not believe that risks can be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Companys risk tolerance. We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Corporate Risk Committee, consisting of senior management executives, monitors risks throughout the Company. In addition to this committee, various departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). The ALCO reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from an adverse change in a borrowers ability to repay their loan. Loan and margin advances are underwritten based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and the fair market value of the underlying collateral, taking into consideration any events that may affect the value of that collateral. The level of credit risk in an individual loan will vary depending on the credit characteristics of the borrower, the magnitude of the transaction and the quality of the collateral, in addition to the terms of the transaction. These risks are monitored at the Bank level by the Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee is responsible for the overall credit risk management of the Bank. This committee reports to the ALCO. The credit risk management process encompasses the entire underwriting and review process from comprehensive credit policies to loan review and regulatory exams. The Credit Risk Committee reviews detail risk measurement and modeling results, and monitors the loan audit review process. The Company conducts independent reviews of the underwriting process for originated and purchased loans. The Credit Risk Committee regularly reviews the results of those reviews. In addition, regulatory examiners review and perform detailed tests of our credit underwriting, loan administration and allowance process. 50 Table of Contents The Credit Risk Committees duties include monitoring asset quality trends, evaluating market conditions including residential real estate markets, determining the adequacy of the allowance, establishing underwriting standards, approving large credit exposures, approving large portfolio purchases and delegating credit approval authority. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and routinely reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate. The section below includes some of the information reviewed by the committee in determining asset quality and the level of adequacy of the allowance. In addition to the Banks Credit Risk Committee, margin receivables are monitored by brokerage management. These receivables are evaluated to determine if the margin receivables have sufficient collateral, that is the value of the securities held as collateral are sufficient to cover the margin receivable balance. In addition, brokerage management monitors situations where trades have occurred and payment was not received due to fraud or returned checks and other electronic transaction rejects. These situations are rare but do occasionally occur. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal control process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from advertising to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof. The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial losses and reputation risks. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships. Third party vendor arrangements are overseen by the Vendor Risk Management group. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conducted financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers. Fraud losses result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and attempt to identify fraudulent transactions promptly. However, new techniques are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. Among other security measures, we offer customers token based security. The tokens display a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds. The number on the display and a password must be used together to access the customers account. This system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss or actual losses depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from inadequate staffing, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in opportunity or actual losses could include the failure of a competitor to meet its customers needs, Internet performance issues, legal, reputation, public policy and strategic risks. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. 51 Table of Contents Allowances for Loan Losses and Uncollectible Margin Receivables Description The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for loan losses was $67.6 million on $26.4 billion of loans designated as held for investment. In addition to our banking loans, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin receivables. At December 31, 2006, margin accounts had approximately $6.9 billion in outstanding margin receivables for which we provided an allowance for uncollectible margin receivables of $19.9 million. Judgments The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge off and loss experience, current industry charge off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Effects if Actual Results Differ Although we have considerable experience in performing these reviews, if managements underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if significant unanticipated changes to the national or regional economies occur, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. If our estimates understate probable losses inherent in the portfolio, this would result in additional expense. A 10% increase or decrease in the allowances would result in a $6.8 million charge or credit to income, respectively. Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments Description We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans and securities, net for our banking investments and gain on sales and impairment of investments for our brokerage (other than those held for market making purposes) and corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized $2.8 million, $40.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively, of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Judgments When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. For illiquid securities, fair value is estimated by obtaining market price quotes on similar liquid securities and adjusting the price to reflect differences. For securities where market quotes and similar securities are not available, we use discounted cash flows. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing 52 Table of Contents losses based on market conditions and other factors. Other than temporary impairment is recorded based on management judgment. Management evaluates securities based on market conditions and all available information about the issuer or underlying collateral. This information is used to determine if impairment is other than temporary. The determination that impairment is other than temporary is judgmental. Based on the facts and circumstances, companies could have different conclusions regarding when securities are other than temporarily impaired. Impairment of mortgage backed or asset backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security meets both criterion, we write the security down to fair value in the current period. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. Effects if Actual Results Differ Earnings could be influenced by the timing of managements decisions to recognize a security as other than temporarily impaired. Our estimates are based on the best available information. Over time additional information may become available and may influence future write downs. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized book were written down, a $310.0 million charge would occur. Management believes that its estimates of other than temporary impairment are supportable and reasonable. See Note 6Available For Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding securities. Valuation and Accounting for Financial Derivatives Description The Banks principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are customer deposits and other short term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long term and short term interest rates and to convert fixed rate assets or liabilities to variable rates. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. Substantially all derivatives held on December 31, 2006 were designated as hedges. As of December 31, 2006, we had derivative assets of $208.1 million and derivative liabilities of $78.7 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had derivative assets of $152.5 million and derivative liabilities of $38.1 million. Judgments Hedge accounting is complex and involves the interpretation of a significant amount of accounting literature. From time to time, new interpretations are issued, which result in new accounting methods applied to existing and new transactions. The implementation of SFAS No. 133, as amended, involves numerous judgments and Company level interpretations. We must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. Judgment is necessary to determine the accounting for our hedging strategies. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. Revised accounting interpretations of existing literature could 53 Table of Contents materially impact our financial results. If 10% of the fair value of derivatives classified in liabilities were determined to relate to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the adjustment would reduce income by $7.9 million before taxes. Similarly, if 10% of the fair value of derivatives included in assets were determined to not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the result would be $20.8 million in additional pre tax income. The most significant effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment is the earnings volatility that would be created by marking the derivatives to market as interest rates change. Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances Description In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and required reserves for potential tax deficiencies and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2006 we had a net deferred tax liability of $58.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $38.3 million. At December 31, 2005 we had a net deferred tax asset as of $3.9 million net of a valuation allowance of $39.4 million. Judgments Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, resolution with taxing authorities of issues with previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Effects if Actual Results Differ These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Description We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2006 was $2.1 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2006 were $471.9 million, which have useful lives between three and thirty years. Judgments In 2006, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill with the assistance of a third party. This evaluation indicated that no impairment charges were necessary. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives on 54 Table of Contents intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If managements estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occurs, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized. Valuation and Expensing of Share Based Payments Description We value and expense employee share based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each periods compensation expense attributed to these options. Judgments We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are managements best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of employees forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by 6%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods. 55 Table of Contents Required Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies The following table shows where you can find the information required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.

The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest earning banking assets and the interest incurred on our interest bearing banking liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous years average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous years volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately (dollars in thousands): 2006 Compared to 2005 Increase (Decrease) Due To 2005 Compared to 2004 Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest earning banking assets: Loans, net(1) $ 398,605 $ 137,551 $ 536,156 $ 286,205 $ 51,962 $ 338,167 Mortgage backed and related available for sale securities 100,043 88,687 188,730 46,805 23,517 70,322 Available for sale investment securities 19,667 33,875 53,542 (19,231 ) 31,843 12,612 Trading securities (8,241 ) 7,287 (954 ) (17,841 ) 7,491 (10,350 ) Other (256 ) 805 549 (1,445 ) (275 ) (1,720 ) Total interest earning banking assets(2) 509,818 268,205 778,023 294,493 114,538 409,031 Interest bearing banking liabilities: Retail deposits 157,493 132,366 289,859 19,287 23,837 43,124 Brokered certificates of deposit 3,329 5,717 9,046 2,699 3,809 6,508 Repurchase agreements and other borrowings 34,185 140,563 174,748 69,040 46,101 115,141 FHLB advances 9,301 29,749 39,050 81,585 (5,145 ) 76,440 Total interest bearing banking liabilities 204,308 308,395 512,703 172,611 68,602 241,213 Change in net operating interest income $ 305,510 $ (40,190 ) $ 265,320 $ 121,882 $ 45,936 $ 167,818 (1) Nonaccrual loans are included in the respective average loan balances.

In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements. We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. In part, the FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances on the security of FHLB stock and various home mortgages and other assets principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2006, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $4.9 billion at interest rates ranging from 3.72% to 6.96% and at a weighted average rate of 5.15%. We also raise funds by selling securities to nationally recognized investment banking firms under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The investment banking firms hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed and variable rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Banks special direct investment and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs. 62 Table of Contents The following table sets forth information regarding the weighted average interest rates and the highest and average month end balances of our short term borrowings (dollars in thousands): Ending Balance Weighted Average Rate(1) Maximum Amount At Month End Yearly Weighted Average Balance Rate At or for the year ended December 31, 2006: Advances from the FHLB $ 4,865,466 5.15 % $ 5,053,982 $ 3,488,184 4.75 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings $ 10,212,993 5.17 % $ 12,483,929 $ 10,980,134 5.00 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2005: Advances from the FHLB $ 3,856,106 4.09 % $ 4,316,683 $ 3,260,556 3.88 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings $ 11,412,028 4.15 % $ 11,412,028 $ 10,115,764 3.70 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2004: Advances from the FHLB $ 1,487,841 2.71 % $ 1,777,110 $ 1,168,519 4.28 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings $ 10,170,082 2.15 % $ 10,285,738 $ 8,139,736 3.18 % (1) Excludes hedging costs. 63 Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF TERMS Active Trader The customer segment that includes those who execute 30 or more trades per quarter and have base pricing of $6.99 to $9.99 per trade.

As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets in increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement of income, as that is not permitted under GAAP.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest Rate Risk The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable rate and fixed rate assets, liabilities and derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. This analysis is based on complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense: Interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may re price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch. The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short and long term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income. Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize. Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, 93% of our total assets were interest earning assets. At December 31, 2006, approximately 66% of our total assets were residential mortgages and available for sale mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment. Our current strategy is to retain more originated mortgage loans on the balance sheet. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. The ALCO reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on loan production volumes and prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy. Our liability structure consists of transactional deposit relationships, such as money market accounts; certificates of deposit; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; free credits; wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities; and long term notes. Our transactional deposit accounts and free credits tend to be less rate sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities and money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and long term notes generally have fixed rates. We held $178.6 million in trading securities as of December 31, 2006. These securities, and the associated interest rate risk, are not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 68 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Strategy Our strategy centers on strengthening and growing our retail business and leveraging that growth in our institutional business. We strive to further develop our retail business by acquiring, expanding and retaining our relationships with global retail customers. We offer our retail and institutional customers a suite of investing, trading, banking and lending products. We plan to grow those relationships organically by using technology to deliver an attractive combination of product, service and price to the value driven mass affluent customer. We also intend to grow, where appropriate, through targeted acquisitions which leverage our existing business platform and through further expansion into certain international markets. As we expand our global customer base, and increase the retail customer cash and credit products we hold on our balance sheet, we believe that our business will benefit. As our institutional business manages our balance sheet on an enterprise wide basis, we become less dependent on revenue from market driven customer trading activity, and our income, while still positioned to benefit from a strong equity market, becomes more recurring in nature. As a result, net operating interest income has become our leading category of revenue, and we anticipate this trend will continue. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; competitors pricing on financial products and services; interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve; and the performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers; deepening customer acceptance of our investing, trading, banking and lending products, including E*TRADE Complete; disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency; maintaining strong overall asset quality; and prudent risk and capital management. 19 Table of Contents Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: At or For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 Customer Activity Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 194.9 $ 177.9 $ 100.0 10 % Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 28.2 $ 18.7 19 % Daily average revenue trades 159,348 97,740 83,643 63 % Average commission per trade $ 12.05 $ 13.82 $ 15.63 (13 )% Products per customer 2.1 2.1 1.9 0 % Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth(2) 42 % 15 % 10 % 27 % Enterprise net interest spread (basis points) 285 249 229 14 % Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 45.4 $ 32.4 $ 26.2 40 % Operating margin (%) 41 % 38 % 33 % 3 % Compensation and benefits as a % of revenue 19 % 22 % 24 % (3 )% (1) Customer cash and deposits, as well as retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005 which reduced both metrics by $564 million. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these items on our balance sheet. (2) Revenue growth is the difference between the current and prior comparable period total net revenue divided by the prior comparable period total net revenue. Customer Activity Metrics Retail client assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in retail client assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and a key driver of net operating interest income. Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers. Average commission per trade is impacted by the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders, mass affluent and main street customers. This metric is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. Products per customer is an indicator of our customer engagement and how well our suite of products and services appeal to our customer base. We believe increases to this measure represent better overall customer engagement with our products and services. Company Financial Metrics Net revenue growth is an indicator of our overall financial well being and our ability to execute on our strategy. When coupled with operating margin, the two provide information about the general success of our business. Enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Enterprise interest earning assets are an indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income, and growth in these assets, in conjunction with net operating interest spread, indicates our ability to grow net operating interest income. 20 Table of Contents Operating margin is an indicator of the profitability of our operations. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of our productivity. In recent periods, we have grown our revenue faster than our compensation expense. This ratio coupled with operating margin is an indictor of our increasing efficiency. Significant Events in 2006 Harrisdirect and BrownCo Customer Conversions We converted Harrisdirect and BrownCo customers to the E*TRADE Financial platform in the first and second quarters of 2006, respectively, which was a key step in the integration of our newly acquired customer base. This allowed us to deliver our functionality and services to these customers while reducing the costs associated with maintaining the legacy platforms. Enhancements to the Complete Investment Account We launched a series of functionality enhancements to the E*TRADE Complete Investment Account designed to help retail customers optimize their investing and borrowing relationships while evaluating their portfolio risk, including the Intelligent Lending Optimizer and the Intelligent Investing Optimizer and Risk Analyzer. We believe these new free tools will help customers better manage their security holdings, cash and credit products. Enhanced Distribution Network We enhanced our distribution network by opening eight new E*TRADE Financial centers in the United States during the period. With the addition of the centers in Seattle, WA; Farmington, MI; Garden City, NY; Torrance, CA; King of Prussia, PA; Roseville, CA; Fort Lauderdale, FL; and Scarsdale, NY, we increased the number of our nationwide financial centers to a total of 24. E*TRADE Complete Savings Account We launched the E*TRADE Complete Savings Account, which allows customers to quickly and easily take advantage of investment opportunities by offering a competitive annual percentage yield, no minimums in balances or account fees and free transfers to any institution. Acquired RAA We completed the purchase of RAA, a Dallas, Texas based investment advisor managing over $1 billion in assets, in the third quarter of 2006. We believe this acquisition strengthens our regional advisor business, which delivers localized wealth management services and advice to retail clients with a minimum of $250,000 in assets. The growth of our wealth management business extends our ability to provide customers with the complete support they are demanding to address their varied financial needs. Launch of New E*TRADE Website We launched a new and improved website at www.etrade.com. The new site features intuitive navigation, demonstrations of some of our most popular products and tools, direct access to account opening and customer service on every page and quick access to our powerful quotes and research functionality. Development of Automated Trading Strategies Functionality We developed new conditional orders functionality for retail customers including trailing stops for options and group orders such as contingent, one cancels all, one triggers all and one trigger one cancels other orders. 21 Table of Contents When combined with the conditional order functionality already available to customers, such as trailing stops and bracketed orders for stocks, we believe this functionality will allow our customers to better manage risk. Move of Exchanges to the NASDAQ On December 27, 2006 we moved the listing of the Companys common stock from the NYSE to the NASDAQ under the symbol ETFC. We made this move to demonstrate our commitment to our customers and shareholders by aligning ourselves with the market that best meets their needs. As an industry innovator, NASDAQs value proposition parallels our own, leveraging technology to provide customers with low fees, superior service and fair, efficient and transparent market access and execution. Increased Ownership of Investsmart We increased our ownership stake in Investsmart. Investsmart is an India based financial services organization providing individuals and corporations with customized financial management solutions. As a result, because we now meet the criteria required to exercise significant influence, we account for Investsmart as an equity method investment. Upgraded Credit Rating Three credit agencies, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys), S&P and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating during 2006. During the second quarter of 2006, Moodys upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from B1 to Ba2 and the long term deposit rating of E*TRADE Bank from Ba2 to Baa3. During the third quarter of 2006, S&P upgraded our rating to BB (stable) from B+ (positive) and DBRS upgraded our rating by two increments to BB (high) from BB (low). DBRS also upgraded the long term deposit rating of E*TRADE Bank to BBB (low) from BB. We believe that our improved profitability and the diversity of our business model were key factors in receiving these upgrades and that these upgrades are an important acknowledgement of the progress we have made as a company. Significant Events in 2005 Acquisition of Harrisdirect and BrownCo We completed our acquisitions of two online discount brokerage companies, Harrisdirect and BrownCo, in the fourth quarter of 2005. At the time of the acquisitions, the companies had approximately $69.0 billion in customer assets including $8.5 billion in customer cash, margin debt of approximately $0.9 billion and brokerage receivables of approximately $3.1 billion. Harrisdirect was purchased for approximately $709 million in cash from Harris Financial Corp, a subsidiary of BMO Financial Group. As part of the financing to acquire Harrisdirect, we issued $450 million in fixed rate senior notes. BrownCo was purchased for approximately $1.6 billion in cash from JPMorgan Chase & Co. As part of the financing to acquire BrownCo, we issued $550 million fixed rate senior notes, $650 million in common stock and $450 million in face value of mandatory convertible notes. The common stock was sold in the market and proceeds were used for the BrownCo acquisition. Acquisition of Wealth Management Advisors We acquired two wealth management advisors, Kobren Insight Management, Inc. (Kobren) and Howard Capital Management, Inc. (Howard Capital) during 2005. These companies provide advisory and asset management services to retail clients. On a combined basis, these companies managed $1.5 billion in customer assets. The growth of our wealth management business extends our ability to provide customers with the complete support they are demanding to address their varied financial needs. 22 Table of Contents Dispositions We sold our Consumer Finance Corporation business, exited our institutional proprietary trading business and made a decision to sell our professional agency business, ultimately executing a sale agreement in February 2006. The Consumer Finance Corporation business originated and serviced recreational vehicles and marine loans. We retained the loan portfolio; however, we no longer originate or service recreational vehicle or marine loans. Introduction of E*TRADE Complete We launched E*TRADE Complete, which offers consumers tools to aid in the optimization of investing, cash management and lending products. E*TRADE Complete tools initially included the Cash Optimizer, the Intelligent Investing Optimizer and the Intelligent Lending Optimizer. Customers can quickly transfer funds to modify deposit balances to determine the optimal distribution of cash between accounts based on their personal preferences. Each customers product selection and mix will depend on their price, liquidity, convenience and risk tolerance preference. The Intelligent Investing Optimizer makes it easy to develop an investment strategy for a customers uninvested cash targeted to specific goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. It also suggests allocations for large cap, small cap, international investment, fixed income and cash. The Intelligent Lending Optimizer is a tool that allows customers to model multiple lending scenarios to determine whether they can lower their borrowing costs. Customers can use E*TRADE Complete in conjunction with our other retail products. Introduction of Token Based Security We began offering a token based security solution to our U.S. based retail customers on a voluntary basis. Using a token based security solution provides an added layer of security at their point of access to the Internet to safeguard their personal financial information. The tokens produce a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds and is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. We believe comprehensive security protection is important to financial consumers and our token based security solution gives us a competitive edge in this area. Introduction of the E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee We developed the E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee, which was launched in January 2006. Our promise to customers is that we will cover certain losses that result from the unauthorized use of our products and services, subject to certain limitations. Under our Complete Payment Protection Guaranty, we ensure that customer payments and transfers are processed exactly as the customer desired. In the unlikely event that any customer payment or transfer is not sent as instructed, we will work with the customer to swiftly resolve the issue and reimburse the customer in full for any late fees, penalties or related finance charges incurred. In addition, under the Complete Privacy Protection Guaranty, we assure our customers that we will undertake our best efforts to maintain their privacy and will not sell personal information to third parties or marketers for any purpose. Enhanced Pricing Structure We changed our pricing structure to reward customers for holding assets with us and to align our structure with the competitive marketplace. The table below shows our pricing as of December 31 for each period: Customer Segment Base Pricing in 2005 and 2006 Base Pricing in 2004 Active Trader $6.99 to $9.99 per trade $9.99 per trade Mass Affluent $9.99 per trade $12.99 per trade Main Street Investor $12.99 per trade $19.99 per trade We changed our customer segment definitions and lowered our fees charged in February 2005 and October 2005. In addition to the fee schedule above, we have grandfathered certain trade pricing for customers acquired through our Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions. 23 Table of Contents Change in Reporting Structure In January 2005, we revised our financial reporting to better reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker assesses our performance and makes resource allocation decisions. As a result, in 2005, we began reporting our operating results in two segments, retail and institutional, rather than our former brokerage and banking segments. For our retail segment, the realignment integrated the management and operations of investing, trading, cash management and lending product and service offerings, including margin receivable activities, and stock plan administration products and services for the retail customer. For our institutional segment, the realignment integrated the management and operations of balance sheet management, market making and global execution and settlement services businesses, with a focus on creating greater integration within our institutional segment and stronger leverage of our retail segment. Summary Financial Results Income Statement Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Total net revenue $ 2,420.3 $ 1,703.8 42 % Net income $ 628.9 $ 430.4 46 % Diluted net earnings per share $ 1.44 $ 1.12 29 % Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses $ 1,355.1 $ 817.1 66 % Operating margin $ 1,000.8 $ 649.8 54 % Operating margin (%) 41 % 38 % 3 % During the year ended December 31, 2006, we continued to strengthen our operating and financial performance. Total net revenue increased 42% and net income increased 46% when compared to 2005. We believe this increase was driven both by our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as by our ability to grow customer cash and deposits, loans (including margin receivables) and DARTs. The growth in customer cash and deposits and total enterprise interest earning assets, including margin receivables, were the primary drivers of our increase in net operating interest income, and the growth in DARTs was the primary driver of our increase in commission revenue. We were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 41% from 38% when compared to the prior year. We believe this growth in operating margin reflects increasing efficiencies in our operations. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 66% to $1,355.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005 and now represents 56% of total net revenue. Net operating interest income benefited from increases in customer cash and deposits coupled with growth in enterprise interest earning assets. Customer cash and deposits, our lowest cost sources of funds, increased $5.4 billion compared to 2005. The increase in customer cash and deposits resulted from organic growth, which we believe is a result, in part, of the Intelligent Cash Optimizer within E*TRADE Complete, which continues to drive growth in customer cash and deposit balances. 24 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions) December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Total assets $ 53.7 $ 44.6 21 % Total enterprise interest earning assets $ 49.9 $ 41.1 22 % Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets(1) 64 % 56 % 8 % Average retail deposits and free credits as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities(1) 62 % 53 % 9 % (1) The table data on average enterprise interest earning assets, loans, net and margin receivables, retail deposits and free credits has been prepared on the same basis as our disclosures with respect to the Bank under the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies. The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to increases of $7.1 billion in loans, net and $1.2 billion in available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities. The increase in loans, net was due principally to growth in our real estate loan portfolio. We continue to focus our efforts on growing our residential mortgage loan portfolios, including one to four family and home equity loans, and allowing our consumer loan portfolio to decline. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased by $13.0 billion in 2006 compared to 2005, which was related primarily to the increase in average loans, net and margin receivables. Retail deposits and free credits were $30.0 billion, up 41% or $8.7 billion during 2006. The increase related to the Harrisdirect conversion, as well as organic growth in checking, money market and certificate of deposit accounts. Retail deposits and free credits are two of our lowest cost sources of funding and are important contributors to our net operating interest income growth. In addition to acquired customer growth, we experienced organic growth which we believe is a result, in part, of the E*TRADE Complete Intelligent Cash Optimizer, as well as an overall focus on price, functionality and service for our global retail customers. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2006 Compared to 2005 Net income from continuing operations increased 40% to $626.8 million for 2006 compared to 2005. We experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in DARTs. We also experienced growth in customer margin balances. In addition, we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 41% in 2006 from 38% when compared to the prior year. We believe this growth in operating margin is reflective of increasing efficiencies in our operations. During 2006, we modified the format of our consolidated income statement to a format that we believe provides a clearer picture of our financial performance and is more consistent with the common presentation found in the financial services industry. We re ordered the revenue section by placing net operating interest income, which we previously referred to as net interest income, first, and non interest income second. In addition, we updated our expense presentation to eliminate the remaining bank/brokerage lines. In conjunction with this change, we created a new expense category, Clearing and servicing. This new category includes trade clearing related expense, previously included in Commissions, clearance and floor brokerage, and most expenses previously included in Servicing and other banking expenses. We also consolidated Fair value adjustments of financial derivatives into the Other expense category. Information related to fair value adjustments of financial derivatives is detailed in Note 9 Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a 25 Table of Contents clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking, lending and balance sheet management businesses. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been used primarily to finance acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo, and generally has not been downstreamed to any of our operating subsidiaries. Similarly, we report gain on sales and impairment of investments separately from gain on sales of loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain on sales of loans and securities, net are the result of activities in our operations, namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses. Gain on sales and impairment of investments relates primarily to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and is not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, expense excluding interest, other income (expense), income tax expense, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Revenue: Operating interest income $ 2,774,679 $ 1,650,264 $ 1,124,415 68 % Operating interest expense (1,374,647 ) (779,164 ) (595,483 ) 76 % Net operating interest income 1,400,032 871,100 528,932 61 % Provision for loan losses (44,970 ) (54,016 ) 9,046 (17 )% Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses 1,355,062 817,084 537,978 66 % Commission 625,265 458,834 166,431 36 % Service charges and fees 137,441 135,314 2,127 2 % Principal transactions 110,235 99,336 10,899 11 % Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 55,986 98,858 (42,872 ) (43 )% Other revenue 136,332 94,419 41,913 44 % Total non interest income 1,065,259 886,761 178,498 20 % Total net revenue $ 2,420,321 $ 1,703,845 $ 716,476 42 % 26 Table of Contents Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses continues to be our largest source of revenue and now represents 56% of total net revenue for 2006. This reflects our focus on retaining retail customer cash and deposits and retail credit balances. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which includes margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The table below presents each revenue component as a percentage of total net revenue.

Institutional commission revenue represented 6% and 7% of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net Operating Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 66% to $1,355.1 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to growth in enterprise interest earning assets coupled with an increase in enterprise net interest spread. The growth in enterprise interest earning assets was driven by increases in both loans, net and margin receivables. The increase in enterprise net interest spread was driven by changes in our mix of lending and funding sources. Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 8% to 64% for 2006 compared to 2005. Average retail deposits and free credits as a percentage of average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 9% to 62% in 2006 compared to 2005. 27 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, and has been prepared on the same basis as our disclosures with respect to E*TRADE Bank under the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

(5) Includes retail certificates of deposit including retail brokered certificates of deposit. (6) Includes institutional certificates of deposit. 28 Table of Contents Despite the flat to inverted yield curve during the period, enterprise net interest spread increased by 36 basis points to 2.85% in 2006, compared to 2005. This increase was primarily the result of our ability to grow low cost deposits and free credits during these periods, which in turn funded our growth in loans, net and margin receivables. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 40% to $45.4 billion for 2006, compared to 2005. Average loans, net and margin receivables grew 60% to $28.9 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. Average loans, net increased as a result of our focus on growing mortgage loan products. The margin receivable portfolio grew, in part, as a result of our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo, as well as organic growth. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 40% to $42.8 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily in low cost customer cash and deposits. Average retail deposits and free credits increased 64% to $26.7 billion for 2006 compared 2005. Increases in average retail deposits and free credits were driven by our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as by organic growth. Our interest rate risk is impacted by external factors such as the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve, the impact of the competitive environment on our pricing and customer behavior. We utilize interest rate derivatives to manage this risk. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Operating interest income: Operating interest income, gross $ 2,763,041 $ 1,662,745 $ 1,100,296 66 % Hedge income (expense) 11,638 (12,481 ) 24,119 * Operating interest income, net 2,774,679 1,650,264 1,124,415 68 % Operating interest expense: Operating interest expense, gross (1,361,170 ) (695,634 ) (665,536 ) 96 % Hedge expense (13,477 ) (83,530 ) 70,053 (84 )% Operating interest expense, net (1,374,647 ) (779,164 ) (595,483 ) 76 % Net operating interest income $ 1,400,032 $ 871,100 $ 528,932 61 % * Percentage not meaningful. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 17% to $45.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to a lower provision for our consumer loan portfolio in connection with the decline in the overall size of the consumer loan portfolio. We expect our provision to increase, however, as we grow our mortgage portfolio at a higher growth rate than the decline in the consumer loan portfolio. 29 Table of Contents Commission Retail and institutional commission revenue increased 36% to $625.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative numbers of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, ETFs, CFDs and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. DARTs increased 63% to 159,348 for 2006 compared to 2005. Our U.S. DART volume increased 65% from 2005, driven by both our acquisitions of BrownCo and Harrisdirect as well as organic customer growth and engagement. Our international DARTs grew by 53% compared to 2005, driven entirely by organic growth. Our international operations continue to be a strong growth contributor within our retail trading business, and we believe that over time it will become a significant component of our entire business. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs and now represent 13% of trading volume versus 10% a year ago. Average commission per trade decreased 13% to $12.05 for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period which resulted in a heavier weighting of Active Traders, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Service Charges and Fees Service charges and fees increased 2% to $137.4 million for 2006 compared to the 2005. The increase in service charges and fees for 2006 was due primarily to an increase in the advisory service fee income. This increase was offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees as our retail customers became more engaged and a greater number of customers exceeded the minimum activity levels required to avoid account maintenance fees. We expect our account maintenance fee income to continue to decline over time; however, we expect our advisory service fee income, which is not currently a significant portion of service charges and fees, to increase over time as we focus on growing this product. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 11% to $110.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in principal transactions resulted from higher trading volumes and market volatility which were offset slightly by a decrease in the average revenue earned per trade. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. 30 Table of Contents Gain on Sales of Loans and Securities, Net Gain on sales of loans and securities, net decreased 43% to $56.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Gain on sales of originated loans: Mortgage loans $ 11,834 $ 39,161 $ (27,327 ) (70 )% Consumer loans(1) 184 15,686 (15,502 ) (99 )% Gain on sales of originated loans 12,018 54,847 (42,829 ) (78 )% Loss on sales of loans held for sale, net (6,775 ) (1,208 ) (5,567 ) * Gain on sales of loans, net 5,243 53,639 (48,396 ) (90 )% Gain on sales of securities, net 50,743 45,219 5,524 12 % Gain on sales of loans and securities, net $ 55,986 $ 98,858 $ (42,872 ) (43 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Consumer loans originated by our retail segment are sold to our institutional segment at an arms length transfer price. The gains (losses) associated with our retail segment were reclassified to discontinued operations and the amounts related to our institutional segment remained in continuing operations. The decline in the total gain on sales of loans and securities, net during 2006 was due primarily to our lower sales of mortgage and consumer loans compared to 2005. We retained a greater number of originated mortgage loans on the balance sheet in an effort to retain the customer relationship and drive growth in net operating interest income. The decline in gain on sales of consumer loans was also due in part to the sale of our consumer finance business in 2005. The increase in gain on sales of securities, net resulted from higher security sales volumes in 2006 compared to 2005. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 44% to $136.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increases were the result of higher payment for order flow from improved option and equity trading volumes, offset by decreases in proprietary fund revenue relating to the closure of certain of our proprietary funds. In addition, other revenue includes foreign exchange margin revenue, stock plan administration products revenue and other revenue ancillary to our retail customer transactions. 31 Table of Contents Expense Excluding Interest The components of expense excluding interest and the year over year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 469,202 $ 380,803 $ 88,399 23 % Clearing and servicing 253,040 189,736 63,304 33 % Advertising and marketing development 119,782 105,935 13,847 13 % Communications 110,346 82,485 27,861 34 % Professional services 96,947 77,416 19,531 25 % Depreciation and amortization 73,845 74,981 (1,136 ) (2 )% Occupancy and equipment 85,568 69,089 16,479 24 % Amortization of other intangibles 46,220 43,765 2,455 6 % Facility restructuring and other exit activities 28,537 (30,017 ) 58,554 * Other 136,042 59,860 76,182 127 % Total expense excluding interest $ 1,419,529 $ 1,054,053 $ 365,476 35 % * Percentage not meaningful. Expense excluding interest increased 35% to $1,419.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by an increase in the number of employees in our service organization, higher trading volumes and loan balances, facility restructuring activities and an increase in fraud related losses. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 23% to $469.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This resulted primarily from a higher number of employees in our service organization, a full year impact of expensing stock options(1) and increased variable and incentive compensation expense. These increases in compensation are in line with the growth and performance of our business and our focus on enhancing customer service with additional representatives. We believe compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue is a measure of our efficiency and the most relevant metric to assess this increase. This ratio declined to 19% for 2006 from 22% for 2005. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 33% to $253.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was a result of higher trading volumes and higher loan balances during the period. Communications Communications expense increased 34% to $110.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to expenses associated with our newly acquired customers from Harrisdirect and BrownCo. In addition, we experienced higher variable expenses, such as quote services and trade confirmations, related to our increase in trading volume. Professional Services Professional services increased 25% to $96.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to third party support services, including technology and transitional service agreements, associated with our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo.  (1) In July 2005 we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Stock option expense was $22.1 million for 2006 and $13.7 for 2005. 32 Table of Contents Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility and restructuring costs were $28.5 million for 2006. During the year, we relocated certain functions out of the state of California. This expense represents certain facility costs as a result of ceasing operations at these locations in addition to severance charges for those employees to whom we communicated our plans and who were terminated as part of this relocation during the year. Other Other expenses increased 127% to $136.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were due primarily to a 212% increase in fraud related losses to $31.2 million for 2006 and the favorable settlement of the Nomura Securities, Inc. (Nomura) litigation, which reduced other expense by $35.0 million in 2005. The fraud related losses were primarily identity theft situations which arose from computer viruses that attacked the personal computers of our customers. We did not suffer from a breach of the security of our systems. We reimbursed customers for their losses through our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee. These fraud schemes have impacted our industry as a whole. While we believe our systems remain safe and secure, we have implemented technological and operational changes to deter unauthorized activity in our customer accounts. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) decreased to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006 compared to income of $26.3 million for 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Other income (expense): Corporate interest income $ 8,433 $ 11,043 $ (2,610 ) (24 )% Corporate interest expense (152,496 ) (73,956 ) (78,540 ) 106 % Gain on sales and impairment of investments 70,796 83,144 (12,348 ) (15 )% Loss on early extinguishment of debt (1,179 ) (1,179 ) * Equity in income of investments and venture funds 2,451 6,103 (3,652 ) (60 )% Total other income (expense) $ (71,995 ) $ 26,334 $ (98,329 ) * * Percentage not meaningful. Other expense for 2006 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the funding of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions beginning in late 2005. Offsetting corporate interest expense was $70.8 million in gain on sales and impairment of investments. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in SBI and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. (ISE) resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense from continuing operations increased 31% to $302.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in income tax expense was principally related to the increase in pre tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 32.5% compared to 34.0% for 2005. The decrease in the 2006 tax rate compared to the 2005 tax rate is primarily due to benefits recognized on state tax refunds filed in one of our jurisdictions as a result of recent favorable court decisions, a reversal of valuation allowance recorded in prior years related to international operations and a continued decrease in our overall effective state tax rate due to our changing geographic footprint. For additional information, see Note 19 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Our net gain (loss) from discontinued operations was $2.0 million for 2006. During 2006 and 2005, our discontinued operations included operating results from our professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC and we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million, net of tax, in 2006. In 2005, discontinued operations also included operating losses from our consumer loan origination business and our proprietary trading business E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, both of which were sold or discontinued during 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net income from continuing operations increased 17% to $446.2 million for 2005 compared to 2004. We experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in DARTs. We also experienced growth in customer margin balances. In addition, we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 38% in 2005 from 33% in 2004. Growth in revenues also was attributed to improved interest rate spread and net interest income from a larger balance sheet. The following sections describe in more detail the changes in key operating factors, and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, expense excluding interest, other income (expense), income tax expense, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. Revenue Net Operating Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 37% to $871.1 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to growth in enterprise interest earning assets coupled with an increase in enterprise net interest spread. The growth in enterprise interest earning assets was driven by increases in both loans, net and margin receivables. The increase in enterprise net interest spread was driven by changes in our mix of lending and funding sources. Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 10% to 56% for 2005 compared to 2004. Average retail deposits and free credits as a percentage of average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 6% to 53% 2005 compared to 2004. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased 42% to $54.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to growth in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, higher consumer loan related losses resulted from higher losses on recreational vehicle loans and higher credit card bankruptcy activity as a significant number of customers filed for personal bankruptcy before the enactment of the new bankruptcy laws in October 2005. Commission Commission revenue increased 6% to $458.8 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the executed trades between these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. Retail commission revenue increased $10.8 million for 2005 compared 2004 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. Average commission per trade decreased 12% to 34 Table of Contents $13.82 for 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease was primarily a function of increased market pressures, strategic pricing and the mix of customers. During 2005, growth in the Active Trader and Mass Affluent customer trading volumes outweighed Main Street Investors trading volumes, who generally have a higher commission per trade, contributing to our lower average commission per trade. Due to the factors described above, our 17% growth in DARTs for 2005 equated to a 3% increase in retail commission revenue during 2005 compared to 2004; however, our business model derives revenue not only from trades but also from other aspects of the relationship we have with our customers, especially those who maintain deposits, free credit and lending balances with us. Our average customer uses at least 2 products or services from our suite of retail products, which is the main driver in our diversification of revenue. For 2005, retail commission revenue represents 20% of total net revenue. Institutional commission revenue increased $16.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase reflects growth in wholesale trading. In early 2005, an institutional wholesale trading group was created to trade large blocks of stock for institutional customers. We provide institutional customers with global execution and settlement services, as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties, in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates, which differ by customer. Service Charges and Fees Service charges and fees increased 39% to $135.3 million for 2005 compared to the 2004. The increase in service charges and fees for 2005 was due primarily to an increase in the account service fees and advisory service fees. The increase in account service fees was due to an increase in account service fees charged beginning in the first quarter of 2005, from $25 to $40 per quarter for customers who did not meet certain criteria for balance and or activity levels. Advisory fees increased as a result of our acquisitions of investment advisory firms. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 22% to $99.3 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower market making volumes and market volatility. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the trading performance of our proprietary trading activities. Gain on Sales of Loans and Securities, Net Gain on sales of loans and securities, net decreased 30% to $98.9 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease was due primarily to lower gain on sales of originated mortgage loans. This was the result of an overall decline in mortgage industry volumes as interest rates continued to rise in 2005. Impairment losses of $38.3 million in 2005 related primarily to interest only securities and to a lesser extent certain investment securities. Impairment on certain interest only securities was the result of short term movements in interest rates. Impairments on investment securities were the result of credit losses in certain investment securities secured by manufactured housing loans. These impairments were not indicative of a specific issue with our investments, but rather an overall deterioration in the manufactured housing loan market. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 6% to $94.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increases were the result of increased options transaction fees and 12b 1 fees, offset by decreases in proprietary fund revenue relating to the closure of certain of our proprietary funds. In addition, other revenue includes foreign exchange margin revenue, stock plan administration products revenue and other revenue ancillary to our retail customer transactions. 35 Table of Contents Expense Excluding Interest Expense excluding interest increased 7% to $1,054.1 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by higher compensation and benefits expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), increased marketing for the launch of E*TRADE Complete and a larger balance sheet. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 9% to $380.8 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from $13.7 million in stock option expense. In July 2005 we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R) which requires the expensing of stock options. We believe compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue is a measure of our efficiency and the most relevant metric to assess this increase. This ratio declined from 24% for 2004 to 22% for 2005. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 17% to $189.7 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in servicing costs due to growth in our loan portfolio which increased 69% compared to 2004. Communications Communications expense increased 18% to $82.5 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to expenses associated with communications to our newly acquired customers from Harrisdirect and BrownCo. In addition, variable expenses such as quote services and trade confirmations increased with our increase in trading volume. Professional Services Professional services increased 12% to $77.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due primarily to third party support services, including technology and transitional service agreements, associated with our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Advertising and Marketing Advertising and marketing costs increased 70% to $105.9 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due primarily to marketing the launch of E*TRADE Complete, as well as an increase in acquisition related and customer retention marketing. Amortization of Other Intangibles Amortization of other intangibles increased 125% to $43.8 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in amortization expense was due primarily to the impairment of our OTC specialist book. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility and restructuring costs were a credit of $30.0 million for 2005. The credit resulted from a $35.5 million, pre tax gain recognized on the sale of the Consumer Finance Corporation servicing business, which was recorded as a facility restructuring cost as it did not qualify as a discontinued operation. Other Other expenses decreased 34% to $59.9 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of the Nomura litigation which reduced other expenses by $35.0 million. 36 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) decreased $42.4 million to income of $26.3 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This decrease was due primarily to lower gain on the sale and impairment of investments of $45.0 million and higher corporate interest expense of $26.4 million resulting from an increase in acquisition related senior notes in 2005, partially offset by the $23.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2004. During 2005, we sold shares of our investments in SBI, Archipelago Holdings, Inc., Ameritrade Holding Corporation and ISE resulting in gains of $82.7 million. During 2004, gain on sales and impairment of investments was related primarily to gain on sales of our investments in SBI in the amount of $130.6 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense from continuing operations increased $48.1 million or 26% for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in income tax expense was related to the increase in pre tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were 34.0% and 32.2%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2004 was due principally to tax benefits recognized in 2004 in connection with the sale of partnership interests which generated an excess tax basis adjustment and the closure of several open IRS tax issues. Discontinued Operations Our net gain (loss) from discontinued operations was a loss of $17.5 million for 2005 and a loss of $1.3 million for 2004. During 2005, our discontinued operations included operating results from our proprietary trading business E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, our professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC and the origination business of Consumer Finance Corporation. During 2004, our discontinued operations included operating results from E*TRADE Access. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change The cumulative effect of accounting change of $1.6 million after tax ($2.8 million pre tax) for 2005 resulted from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment, effective July 1, 2005, which required us to record compensation expense for stock options. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recorded compensation expense for restricted stock awards on a straight line basis over their vesting period. If an employee forfeited the award prior to vesting, we reversed out the previously expensed amounts in the period of forfeiture. As required upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we must base the accruals of compensation expense on the estimated number of awards for which the requisite service period is expected to be rendered. Actual forfeitures are no longer recorded in the period of forfeiture. The pre tax credit of $2.8 million in cumulative effect of accounting change represents the amount by which compensation expense would have been reduced in periods prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) for restricted stock awards outstanding on July 1, 2005 that are anticipated to be forfeited. 37 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW Retail Retail segment income increased 52% to $695.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 2004 Amount % Retail segment income: Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses $ 883,563 $ 445,124 $ 322,278 $ 438,439 98 % Commission 479,876 339,654 328,889 140,222 41 % Service charges and fees 115,672 116,102 84,445 (430 ) (0 )% Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 36,698 63,705 93,694 (27,007 ) (42 )% Other revenue 138,316 112,836 106,457 25,480 23 % Net segment revenue 1,654,125 1,077,421 935,763 576,704 54 % Total segment expense 958,882 618,664 628,146 340,218 55 % Total retail segment income $ 695,243 $ 458,757 $ 307,617 $ 236,486 52 % Key Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 194.9 $ 177.9 $ 100.0 $ 17.0 10 % Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 28.2 $ 18.7 $ 5.4 19 % DARTs 159,348 97,740 83,643 61,608 63 % Average commission per trade $ 12.05 $ 13.82 $ 15.63 $ (1.77 ) (13 )% Average margin receivables (dollars in billions) $ 6.8 $ 2.8 $ 2.0 $ 4.0 143 % Products per customer 2.1 2.1 1.9 % (1) Total customer cash and deposits, as well as total retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005, which reduced both metrics by $564 million. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these line items on our balance sheet. Our retail segment generates revenue from investing, trading, banking and lending relationships with retail customers. These relationships essentially drive five sources of revenue including net operating interest income; commission; service charges and fees; gain on sales of loans and securities, net; and other revenue. This segment also includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we are ultimately servicing a retail customer through these corporate relationships. Our geographically dispersed retail accounts grew 3% from 2005 to 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3.6 million active trading and investing accounts and 0.8 million active lending and deposit accounts. The increase in retail segment income during 2006 compared to a year ago was due to an increase in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Retail net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 98% to $883.6 million for 2006 compared to 2005. Average margin receivables increased 143% to $6.8 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. Higher margin balances generally translate into a higher interest rate earned on interest earning assets. Customer cash and deposits increased 19% at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Higher customer cash and deposit balances generally translate into a lower cost of funds as deposits increased in comparison to other borrowings. Net operating interest income growth included the impact of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Retail commission revenue increased $140.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. The increase in DART volumes was the result of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions as well as strong organic growth in domestic equity, international equity and option trades. 38 Table of Contents A shift in the composition of our retail customers who traded during the year resulted in a 13% decrease in average commission per trade for 2006 compared to 2005. As a result, our 63% growth in DARTs for 2006 equated to a 41% increase in retail commission revenue for 2006; however, we derive revenue not only from trades but also from other aspects of our relationship with our customers, especially customers who maintain deposits and free credits with us. Our average customer uses at least 2 products or services from our suite of retail products, which is the main driver in our diversification of revenue. As such, while retail commission revenue increased 41% during 2006, total retail segment revenue increased 54%. Offsetting these increases were lower gains on the sales of loans and securities, net of $36.7 million for 2006. In addition, service charges and fees decreased $0.4 million for 2006 compared to 2005. Retail segment expense increased $340.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase for 2006 was related primarily to the $29.6 million restructuring charge, an increase in the compensation expense due to an increased number of employees in our service organization and increased fraud related losses. 2005 Compared to 2004 The 49% increase in retail segment income for 2005 compared to 2004 was due to an increase in net revenue driven primarily by an increase in net operating interest income, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. DARTs increased 17% in 2005 compared to 2004. While the increase in DARTs did not produce a corresponding increase in commission revenues, these customers did help drive the increase in cash deposits held in sweep deposit accounts. Retail net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 38% to $445.1 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was driven by an increase in both average enterprise interest earning assets and the net interest spread earned. Growth in average margin receivables was 40% to $2.8 billion in 2005 compared to 2004, including the impact of our acquisitions. Other key drivers of this increase in retail segment income were growth in the average balances of loans and deposits which increased 54% and 11%, respectively over last year. Service charges and fees increased by 37% in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to an increase in account service fees. Offsetting these positive variances were lower gains on the sale of loans and securities, net of $30.0 million due to the lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans and securities impairment. Institutional Institutional segment income increased 60% to $305.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 2004 Amount % Institutional segment income: Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses 471,499 372,122 274,743 99,377 27 % Commission 145,389 119,180 102,749 26,209 22 % Service charges and fees 21,769 19,212 13,130 2,557 13 % Principal transactions 110,235 99,175 126,893 11,060 11 % Gain on sales of loans and securities, net 19,288 35,153 47,024 (15,865 ) (45 )% Other revenue 9,269 10,383 16,684 (1,114 ) (11 )% Net segment revenue 777,449 655,225 581,223 122,224 19 % Total segment expense 471,900 464,190 393,041 7,710 2 % Total institutional segment income $ 305,549 $ 191,035 $ 188,182 $ 114,514 60 % Key Metrics: Total nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans, net 0.28 % 0.18 % 0.17 % 0.10 % Average revenue capture per 1,000 equity shares $ 0.373 $ 0.458 $ 0.341 $ (0.085 ) (19) % 39 Table of Contents Our institutional segment generates earnings from balance sheet management activities, market making and global execution and settlement services. Balance sheet management activities include purchasing loan receivables from the retail segment as well as third parties, and leveraging these loans and retail customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income. Retail trading order flow is leveraged by the institutional segment to generate additional revenue for the Company. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 27% to $471.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was primarily a result of growth in interest earning assets, which are funded primarily by retail customer cash and deposit balances. These customer balances were kept on balance sheet as a low cost source of funding and then utilized by the institutional segment either to purchase interest earning assets or pay down wholesale liabilities. Institutional commissions increased 22% to $145.4 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was due to a more favorable trading environment and the continued leveraging of our integrated institutional model with higher retail order flow. We provide institutional customers with global execution and settlement services, as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties, in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates, which differ by customer. The increase in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue was offset by a planned decrease in gain on sales of loans and securities, net of approximately $15.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. We evaluate our portfolio of securities available for sale in light of changing market conditions and where appropriate, take steps intended to optimize our overall economic position. During 2006, we determined that we would not sell securities at similar levels as 2005 because we focused on growing our balance sheet. Total institutional segment expense increased 2% to $471.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005 and was predominantly volume related. Compensation and benefits expense increased due to increases in variable and performance based compensation and expensing of stock options. Clearing and servicing expense increased due to increased overall trading volumes and the increase in our loan portfolio. 2005 Compared to 2004 The 2% increase in institutional segment income in 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable to a $74.0 million increase in net revenue offset by a $71.1 million increase in expenses. The increase in net revenue resulted from higher net operating interest income due to higher average balances of enterprise interest earning assets. The increase in the net operating interest income was partially driven by a shift from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans. The increase in expenses was driven by an increase in intangible amortization due to the impairment of our OTC Specialist Book, compensation and benefits expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and commissions due to an increase in overall trading volumes and higher servicing expenses related to an increase in loans serviced. 40 Table of Contents BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Assets: Cash and equivalents(1) $ 1,493,856 $ 1,454,362 3 % Trading securities 178,600 146,657 22 % Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 13,921,983 12,763,438 9 % Loans held for sale 283,496 87,371 224 % Brokerage receivables, net 7,636,352 7,174,175 6 % Loans receivable, net 26,372,697 19,424,895 36 % Other assets(2) 3,852,319 3,516,788 10 % Total assets $ 53,739,303 $ 44,567,686 21 % Liabilities and shareholders equity: Deposits $ 24,071,012 $ 15,948,015 51 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 9,792,422 11,101,542 (12 )% Brokerage payables 7,824,704 7,342,208 7 % Other borrowings 5,323,962 4,206,996 27 % Corporate debt(3) 1,842,169 2,022,701 (9 )% Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities 688,664 546,664 26 % Total liabilities 49,542,933 41,168,126 20 % Shareholders equity 4,196,370 3,399,560 23 % Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 53,739,303 $ 44,567,686 21 % (1) Includes balance sheet line items cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations. (2) Includes balance sheet line items property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and Other assets. (3) Includes balance sheet line items senior notes, mandatory convertible notes and convertible subordinated notes. During the period, we re aligned our balance sheet to consolidate several categories and changed the name of Other borrowings by Bank subsidiary to Other borrowings. Other borrowings include non Bank subsidiary term notes previously classified in Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities. Categories consolidated and related changes include: Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock was added to Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities; Derivative assets and Accrued interest receivable were added to Other assets; and Derivative liabilities was added to Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities. These categories were consolidated with other similar items in our balance sheet presentation. The notes to our consolidated financial statements continue to include detailed information about the individual items no longer listed on the face of the balance sheet. The 21% increase in total assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of growth in loans receivable, net and available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities. The growth in loans receivable, net was the result of our continued focus on growing our residential mortgage loan portfolios, including one to four family mortgages and home equity loans. The growth in available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities was due primarily to the growth in our asset backed securities portfolio. 41 Table of Contents The 20% increase in total liabilities at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 was attributable primarily to a $8.1 billion increase in deposits. The increase in deposits was due to higher sweep deposit accounts and money market deposits resulting, in part, from our conversion of Harrisdirect customers during the first quarter of 2006, as well as from organic growth from existing and new customers. The increase in deposits was partially offset by declines in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and corporate debt. The conversion of Harrisdirect customers to the E*TRADE Financial platform resulted in the transfer of customer brokerage receivables, deposits and customer brokerage payables from a third party provider to us. Customer brokerage receivables or margin receivables of $0.8 billion were transferred to our balance sheet. In addition, sweep deposit balances of $2.7 billion and brokerage payables, specifically free credits, of $1.3 billion were also moved to our balance sheet. Loans Receivable, Net Loans receivable, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Real estate loans: One to four family $ 10,870,214 $ 7,091,664 53 % Home equity lines of credit (HELOC), Home equity installment loans (HEIL) and other 11,809,008 8,106,820 46 % Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 2,292,356 2,692,055 (15 )% Marine 651,764 752,645 (13 )% Commercial 219,008 89,098 146 % Credit card 128,583 188,600 (32 )% Automobile 77,533 235,388 (67 )% Other 3,706 8,338 (56 )% Unamortized premiums, net 388,153 323,573 20 % Allowance for loan losses (67,628 ) (63,286 ) 7 % Total loans receivable, net $ 26,372,697 $ 19,424,895 36 % Loans receivable, net increased 36% to $26.4 billion at December 31, 2006 from $19.4 billion at December 31, 2005. We continue to focus our growth in real estate loans while allowing our consumer loans to decline. We anticipate that our mortgage and HELOC portfolios will continue to increase over time, and we believe this will improve our credit risk profile. We anticipate that recreational vehicle and marine loan balances will continue to decline over time due to our sale of Consumer Finance Corporation in 2005, and automobile loans will continue to decline due to our exit of the automobile origination business in 2004. Commercial loans increased 146% to $219.0 million at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. In general, we believe the 42 Table of Contents allowance for loan losses should be equal to at least twelve months of probable projected losses for all loan types. We believe this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands): Consumer & Other Real Estate Total Allowance Allowances as % of Consumer and OtherLoans Receivable Allowance Allowances as % of Real Estate Loans Receivable Allowance Allowances as % of Total Loans Receivable December 31, 2006 $ 28,197 0.82 % $ 39,431 0.17 % $ 67,628 0.26 % December 31, 2005 $ 32,379 0.80 % $ 30,907 0.20 % $ 63,286 0.32 % The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Allowance for loan losses, beginning of period $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 $ 19,874 Provision for loan losses 44,970 54,016 38,121 38,523 14,664 Allowance acquired through acquisitions(1) 1,547 2,748 14,428 Charge offs: Real estate (616 ) (936 ) (186 ) (364 ) (460 ) HELOC, HEIL and other (15,372 ) (3,929 ) (1,464 ) (75 ) Recreational vehicle (25,253 ) (20,592 ) (18,419 ) (20,341 ) (3,456 ) Marine (6,463 ) (8,009 ) (6,003 ) (7,369 ) Commercial Credit card (11,371 ) (17,286 ) (10,313 ) (919 ) Automobile (2,430 ) (5,915 ) (13,796 ) (22,695 ) (28,046 ) Other (338 ) (180 ) (160 ) (1,971 ) Total charge offs (61,843 ) (56,847 ) (50,341 ) (53,734 ) (31,962 ) Recoveries: Real estate 167 234 223 30 HELOC, HEIL and other 822 526 310 Recreational vehicle 11,959 7,848 9,088 9,738 Marine 4,091 3,960 3,225 3,806 Commercial Credit card 750 380 141 1 Automobile 3,285 5,382 7,464 8,335 10,632 Other 141 106 279 541 Total recoveries 21,215 18,436 20,507 22,644 10,662 Net charge offs (40,628 ) (38,411 ) (29,834 ) (31,090 ) (21,300 ) Allowance for loan losses, end of period $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 Net charge offs to average loans receivable, net outstanding 0.18 % 0.26 % 0.30 % 0.41 % 0.28 % (1) Acquisition of credit card portfolios in 2004 and 2003 and the Consumer Finance Corporation portfolio in 2002. 43 Table of Contents The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by loan category (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Real estate loans: One to four family $ 7,760 41.7 % $ 4,858 37.0 % $ 2,812 32.3 % $ 2,360 28.6 % $ 3,343 29.8 % HELOC, HEIL and other 31,671 45.3 26,049 42.3 15,183 31.9 3,302 19.1 851 6.8 Total real estate loans 39,431 87.0 30,907 79.3 17,995 64.2 5,662 47.7 4,194 36.6 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 11,077 8.8 13,465 14.1 11,343 22.4 11,386 28.3 9,480 24.8 Marine 3,648 2.5 4,590 3.9 4,116 6.3 2,503 7.9 3,108 8.4 Commercial 1,635 0.9 669 0.5 22 4 Credit card 10,611 0.5 11,714 1.0 9,078 1.8 5,583 1.4 Automobile 534 0.3 1,080 1.2 4,195 5.1 11,876 14.5 8,190 27.4 Other 692 861 932 0.2 833 0.2 2,694 2.8 Total consumer and other loans 28,197 13.0 32,379 20.7 29,686 35.8 32,185 52.3 23,472 63.4 Total allowance for loan losses $ 67,628 100.0 % $ 63,286 100.0 % $ 47,681 100.0 % $ 37,847 100.0 % $ 27,666 100.0 % (1) Represents percentage of loans receivable in category to total loans receivable, excluding premium (discount). Losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For first lien mortgages, a charge off is recognized when we foreclose on the property. For revolving loans, our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. During 2006, the allowance for loan losses increased by $4.3 million from the level at December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to growth in the real estate loan portfolio, which increased approximately $7.5 billion over the same period and is not indicative of a decline in our overall credit standards. The allowance increased by $8.5 million related to the growth of the real estate portfolio. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in the allowance for loan losses of $4.2 million related to the decline in the size of the consumer loan portfolio. Net charge offs for the year ended 2006 compared to 2005 increased by $2.2 million. The overall increase was due to higher net charge offs on real estate loans offset by lower net charge offs on consumer loans. The increase in real estate loan charge offs was due to the growth of the portfolio and the decrease in consumer loan charge offs was due primarily to a decline in loan balances as we exited the consumer finance business in 2005. Annualized net charge offs as a percentage of average loans receivable, net were 0.18% at December 31, 2006 compared to 0.26% at December 31, 2005. 44 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets We classify loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Real estate loans: One to four family $ 34,219 $ 18,067 $ 11,029 $ 18,094 $ 22,497 HELOC, HEIL and other 32,216 9,568 2,755 269 81 Total real estate loans 66,435 27,635 13,784 18,363 22,578 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 2,579 2,826 1,416 1,399 1,486 Marine 1,439 873 908 1,067 94 Commercial Credit card 3,795 2,858 2,999 2,147 Automobile 1,047 448 826 1,602 2,277 Other 46 14 22 16 53 Total consumer and other loans 8,906 7,019 6,171 6,231 3,910 Total nonperforming loans 75,341 34,654 19,955 24,594 26,488 Real estate owned (REO) and other repossessed assets, net 12,904 6,555 5,367 6,690 6,723 Total nonperforming assets, net $ 88,245 $ 41,209 $ 25,322 $ 31,284 $ 33,211 Total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans, net 0.28 % 0.18 % 0.17 % 0.27 % 0.36 % Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable(1) 90.52 % 186.24 % 281.55 % 187.61 % N/A (1) (1) This metric was changed to reflect the percentage of allowance for loan losses in relation to the total nonperforming loans receivable. In 2002, nonperforming loans were not tracked as held for investment versus held for sale; as such, this metric is not available. We expect nonperforming loan levels to fluctuate over time due to portfolio growth, portfolio seasoning and resolution through collections, sales or charge offs. The performance of any loan can be affected by external factors, such as economic conditions or factors particular to the borrower. During 2006, our nonperforming assets, net increased $47.0 million from $41.2 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was attributed to an increase in nonperforming real estate loans and REO and other repossessed assets, net of $45.1 million and an increase in nonperforming consumer and other loans of $1.9 million. These trends are not the result of a deterioration or improvement in credit quality, but are reflective of our targeted growth in real estate loans and the targeted decrease in consumer loans. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net decreased from 186% in 2005 to 91% in 2006. As our loan portfolio shifts to mortgage loans, where the risk of charge off is generally less than the risk of charge off on a consumer loan, the level of the allowance to nonperforming assets may continue to decrease. In addition to nonperforming assets in the table above, we monitor loans where a borrowers past credit history casts doubt on the borrowers ability to repay a loan, whether or not the loan is delinquent (Special Mention loans). Special Mention loans represented $261.5 million, or 1%, and $127.2 million, or 1%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These loans are actively monitored, continue to accrue interest and remain a component of the loans receivable balance. The increase in Special Mention loans was due primarily to an increase in the 30 day delinquency category of mortgage loans. Significant migration from this category to more serious delinquency classifications is not expected to occur. 45 Table of Contents Available for Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities Available for sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. government sponsored and Federal agencies $ 9,109,307 $ 9,427,521 (3 )% Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 1,108,385 995,891 11 % Total mortgage backed securities 10,217,692 10,423,412 (2 )% Investment securities: Asset backed securities 2,161,728 1,365,754 58 % Publicly traded equity securities: Preferred stock 458,674 288,365 59 % Corporate investments 24,139 147,400 (84 )% FHLB stock 244,212 198,700 23 % Other 815,538 339,807 140 % Total investment securities 3,704,291 2,340,026 58 % Total available for sale securities $ 13,921,983 $ 12,763,438 9 % Available for sale securities represented 26% and 29% of total assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Available for sale securities increased 9% to $13.9 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, due primarily to the growth in our asset backed securities portfolio. We evaluate our available for sale securities in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall position. We determined that we would not sell our mortgage backed and asset backed securities at similar levels as 2005 because we focused on growing our balance sheet. As interest rates increase, the fair value of fixed rate available for sale securities decreases and vice versa. The fair value of the portfolio will be adversely impacted in 2007 if long term interest rates continue to rise. Net unrealized gains and losses in available for sale securities are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Deposits Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Sweep deposit accounts $ 10,837,124 $ 7,733,267 40 % Money market and savings accounts 7,634,241 4,635,866 65 % Certificates of deposit(1) 4,737,253 2,703,605 75 % Brokered certificates of deposit(2) 483,777 484,612 (0 )% Checking accounts 378,617 390,665 (3 )% Total deposits $ 24,071,012 $ 15,948,015 51 % (1) Includes retail certificates of deposit including retail brokered certificates of deposit. (2) Includes institutional certificates of deposit. Deposits represented 49% and 39% of total liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deposits increased $8.1 billion to $24.1 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, driven by 46 Table of Contents a $3.1 billion increase in sweep deposit accounts, a $3.0 billion increase in money market and savings accounts and a $2.0 billion increase in certificates of deposit. The increase in sweep deposit accounts was driven primarily by the Harrisdirect and BrownCo conversions. Prior to the conversions, Harrisdirect customer cash balances were swept to a third party and not reflected on our balance sheet, and BrownCo customer cash balances were generally kept in free credits. Our other deposit products have shown significant growth as a result of our focused sales and retention efforts, as well as the overall impact of the E*TRADE Complete Intelligent Cash Optimizer. E*TRADE Complete Intelligent Cash Optimizer enables customers to better determine the optimal use of their funds and has resulted in higher money market and certificates of deposit balances. The sweep deposit accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives. The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $33.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 Amount % Deposits $ 24,071,012 $ 15,948,015 $ 8,122,997 51 % Less: brokered certificates of deposit (483,777 ) (484,612 ) 835 0 % Deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit 23,587,235 15,463,403 8,123,832 53 % Free credits 6,368,749 5,770,751 597,998 10 % Customer cash balances held by third parties 3,633,783 6,955,830 (3,322,047 ) (48 )% Total customer cash and deposits $ 33,589,767 $ 28,189,984 $ 5,399,783 19 % The decrease in customer cash balances held by third parties was due primarily to the Harrisdirect conversion wherein cash from this account (which is off balance sheet) was converted to deposits and free credits (which is on balance sheet). Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 9,792,422 $ 11,101,542 (12 )% FHLB advances $ 4,865,466 $ 3,856,106 26 % Subordinated debentures 385,502 305,046 26 % Other 72,994 45,844 59 % Total other borrowings $ 5,323,962 $ 4,206,996 27 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 12% at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. During 2006, the Bank used these wholesale sources along with deposit growth to fund the increase in loans receivable. Other borrowings represented 11% and 10% of total liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase of $1.1 billion during 2006 was due primarily to an increase in FHLB advances. We actively manage our funding sources and determine the optimal mix based on pricing, liquidity and capacity during each period. 47 Table of Contents Corporate Debt Corporate debt decreased to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company called the remaining $185.2 million principal amount of its 6.00% convertible subordinated notes due February 2007 (6.00% Notes) during the year ended December 31, 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our liquidity and capital resources enable us to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions and grow our assets. Cash flows are derived from capital market activities and our operations in the retail and institutional segments. The segment cash flows provide capital to fund growth in our regulated subsidiaries. The Companys cash and equivalents balance increased to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. Changes in Cash and Equivalents In 2006, cash and equivalents at E*TRADE Financial Corporation, on a standalone holding company basis, increased $46.0 million to $139.5 million due primarily to a decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $2.2 billion offset by a decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion. The following significant activities and events impacting cash occurred during the year ended December 31, 2006: The acquisition of RAA for $15.3 million; and Repurchases of shares of common stock outstanding of $122.6 million. During the year ended 2006, the Company called the remaining $185.2 million principal amount of its 6.00% convertible subordinated notes due February 2007 (6.00% Notes). In April 2006, the Company completed the partial redemption that was originally announced in March 2006 and called the remaining $92.6 million principal amount of its 6.00% Notes. The table below shows the timing and impact of these calls (dollars and shares in millions): Debt Redeemed Common Stock Shares Issued Cash Paid First call in March 2006 March redemptions $ 36.3 1.5 $ April redemptions 56.3 2.4 0.9 Second call in April 2006(1) 92.6 3.9 0.9 Total redemptions $ 185.2 7.8 $ 1.8 (1) All redemptions occurred in April. Our current senior debt ratings are Ba2 (positive outlook) by Moodys Investor Service, BB (stable) by Standard & Poors and BB (high) by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS). The Companys long term deposit ratings are Baa3 by Moodys Investor Service, BB+ (stable) by Standard & Poors and BBB (low) by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, Inc. (Converging Arrows), is limited by regulatory requirements. Converging Arrows is a subsidiary of the parent company. At December 31, 2006, Converging Arrows had $107.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Converging Arrows is not restricted in its dealings with the parent company and may transfer funds to the parent company without regulatory approval. In addition to Converging Arrows, brokerage and banking subsidiaries may provide liquidity to the parent; however, they are restricted by regulatory guidelines. The Bank is prohibited by regulations from lending to the parent company. At December 31, 2006, the Bank had approximately $149.1 million of capital available for dividend declaration without regulatory approval while still maintaining well capitalized status. The Bank is also required by OTS regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of tangible assets. The Bank satisfied this requirement at December 31, 2006 and 2005. 48 Table of Contents The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 administered by the SEC, the NYSE and NASD, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, all of our brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $628.1 million at December 31, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Other Sources of Liquidity We maintain committed and uncommitted financing facilities with banks totaling $800.0 million to meet corporate liquidity needs and finance margin lending. There were no outstanding balances and the full $800.0 million was available under these lines at December 31, 2006 and 2005. We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to provide liquidity for the Bank. At December 31, 2006, the Bank had approximately $7.6 billion in additional borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Years ending December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Security commitments to: Purchase securities $ 3,611,937 $ $ $ $ $ $ 3,611,937 Sell securities (2,718,931 ) (2,718,931 ) Loan commitments to: Purchase loans 1,118,529 1,118,529 Originate loans(1) 456,630 456,630 Sell loans (60,282 ) (60,282 ) Equity funding commitments(2) 17,393 17,514 43 34,950 Acquisition related commitments(3) 1,250 1,250 Certificates of deposit(4)(5) 4,496,319 388,397 187,764 130,218 128,453 118,313 5,449,464 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings(5) 11,590,124 1,154,323 252,489 226,331 125,391 3,714,084 17,062,742 Convertible and Senior notes(6) 136,062 135,905 135,438 135,438 615,438 1,712,578 2,870,859 Facilities offered for sublease, less estimated future sublease income(7) 11,743 5,542 5,059 3,012 71 68 25,495 Operating lease payments 38,478 36,315 30,874 28,348 21,184 75,414 230,613 Purchase Obligations(8) 74,141 14,574 3,219 2,264 1,833 96,031 Total contractual obligations(9) $ 18,773,393 $ 1,752,570 $ 614,886 $ 525,611 $ 892,370 $ 5,620,457 $ 28,179,287 (1) Contains optional commitments to originate.

We may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. RISK MANAGEMENT As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. Transactions including the opening of an account, processing of a trade, acceptance of a deposit, hiring a new employee and acquiring a company, all involve a certain amount of risk. The identification and management of risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. We do not believe that risks can be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Companys risk tolerance. We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Corporate Risk Committee, consisting of senior management executives, monitors risks throughout the Company. In addition to this committee, various departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). The ALCO reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from an adverse change in a borrowers ability to repay their loan. Loan and margin advances are underwritten based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and the fair market value of the underlying collateral, taking into consideration any events that may affect the value of that collateral. The level of credit risk in an individual loan will vary depending on the credit characteristics of the borrower, the magnitude of the transaction and the quality of the collateral, in addition to the terms of the transaction. These risks are monitored at the Bank level by the Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee is responsible for the overall credit risk management of the Bank. This committee reports to the ALCO. The credit risk management process encompasses the entire underwriting and review process from comprehensive credit policies to loan review and regulatory exams. The Credit Risk Committee reviews detail risk measurement and modeling results, and monitors the loan audit review process. The Company conducts independent reviews of the underwriting process for originated and purchased loans. The Credit Risk Committee regularly reviews the results of those reviews. In addition, regulatory examiners review and perform detailed tests of our credit underwriting, loan administration and allowance process. 50 Table of Contents The Credit Risk Committees duties include monitoring asset quality trends, evaluating market conditions including residential real estate markets, determining the adequacy of the allowance, establishing underwriting standards, approving large credit exposures, approving large portfolio purchases and delegating credit approval authority. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and routinely reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate. The section below includes some of the information reviewed by the committee in determining asset quality and the level of adequacy of the allowance. In addition to the Banks Credit Risk Committee, margin receivables are monitored by brokerage management. These receivables are evaluated to determine if the margin receivables have sufficient collateral, that is the value of the securities held as collateral are sufficient to cover the margin receivable balance. In addition, brokerage management monitors situations where trades have occurred and payment was not received due to fraud or returned checks and other electronic transaction rejects. These situations are rare but do occasionally occur. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal control process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from advertising to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof. The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial losses and reputation risks. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships. Third party vendor arrangements are overseen by the Vendor Risk Management group. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conducted financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers. Fraud losses result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and attempt to identify fraudulent transactions promptly. However, new techniques are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. Among other security measures, we offer customers token based security. The tokens display a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds. The number on the display and a password must be used together to access the customers account. This system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss or actual losses depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from inadequate staffing, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in opportunity or actual losses could include the failure of a competitor to meet its customers needs, Internet performance issues, legal, reputation, public policy and strategic risks. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. 51 Table of Contents Allowances for Loan Losses and Uncollectible Margin Receivables Description The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for loan losses was $67.6 million on $26.4 billion of loans designated as held for investment. In addition to our banking loans, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin receivables. At December 31, 2006, margin accounts had approximately $6.9 billion in outstanding margin receivables for which we provided an allowance for uncollectible margin receivables of $19.9 million. Judgments The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge off and loss experience, current industry charge off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Effects if Actual Results Differ Although we have considerable experience in performing these reviews, if managements underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if significant unanticipated changes to the national or regional economies occur, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. If our estimates understate probable losses inherent in the portfolio, this would result in additional expense. A 10% increase or decrease in the allowances would result in a $6.8 million charge or credit to income, respectively. Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments Description We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans and securities, net for our banking investments and gain on sales and impairment of investments for our brokerage (other than those held for market making purposes) and corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized $2.8 million, $40.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively, of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Judgments When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. For illiquid securities, fair value is estimated by obtaining market price quotes on similar liquid securities and adjusting the price to reflect differences. For securities where market quotes and similar securities are not available, we use discounted cash flows. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing 52 Table of Contents losses based on market conditions and other factors. Other than temporary impairment is recorded based on management judgment. Management evaluates securities based on market conditions and all available information about the issuer or underlying collateral. This information is used to determine if impairment is other than temporary. The determination that impairment is other than temporary is judgmental. Based on the facts and circumstances, companies could have different conclusions regarding when securities are other than temporarily impaired. Impairment of mortgage backed or asset backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security meets both criterion, we write the security down to fair value in the current period. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. Effects if Actual Results Differ Earnings could be influenced by the timing of managements decisions to recognize a security as other than temporarily impaired. Our estimates are based on the best available information. Over time additional information may become available and may influence future write downs. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized book were written down, a $310.0 million charge would occur. Management believes that its estimates of other than temporary impairment are supportable and reasonable. See Note 6Available For Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding securities. Valuation and Accounting for Financial Derivatives Description The Banks principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are customer deposits and other short term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long term and short term interest rates and to convert fixed rate assets or liabilities to variable rates. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. Substantially all derivatives held on December 31, 2006 were designated as hedges. As of December 31, 2006, we had derivative assets of $208.1 million and derivative liabilities of $78.7 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had derivative assets of $152.5 million and derivative liabilities of $38.1 million. Judgments Hedge accounting is complex and involves the interpretation of a significant amount of accounting literature. From time to time, new interpretations are issued, which result in new accounting methods applied to existing and new transactions. The implementation of SFAS No. 133, as amended, involves numerous judgments and Company level interpretations. We must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. Judgment is necessary to determine the accounting for our hedging strategies. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. Revised accounting interpretations of existing literature could 53 Table of Contents materially impact our financial results. If 10% of the fair value of derivatives classified in liabilities were determined to relate to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the adjustment would reduce income by $7.9 million before taxes. Similarly, if 10% of the fair value of derivatives included in assets were determined to not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the result would be $20.8 million in additional pre tax income. The most significant effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment is the earnings volatility that would be created by marking the derivatives to market as interest rates change. Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances Description In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and required reserves for potential tax deficiencies and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2006 we had a net deferred tax liability of $58.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $38.3 million. At December 31, 2005 we had a net deferred tax asset as of $3.9 million net of a valuation allowance of $39.4 million. Judgments Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, resolution with taxing authorities of issues with previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Effects if Actual Results Differ These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Description We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2006 was $2.1 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2006 were $471.9 million, which have useful lives between three and thirty years. Judgments In 2006, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill with the assistance of a third party. This evaluation indicated that no impairment charges were necessary. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives on 54 Table of Contents intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If managements estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occurs, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized. Valuation and Expensing of Share Based Payments Description We value and expense employee share based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each periods compensation expense attributed to these options. Judgments We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are managements best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of employees forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by 6%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods. 55 Table of Contents Required Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies The following table shows where you can find the information required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.

In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements. We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. In part, the FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances on the security of FHLB stock and various home mortgages and other assets principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2006, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $4.9 billion at interest rates ranging from 3.72% to 6.96% and at a weighted average rate of 5.15%. We also raise funds by selling securities to nationally recognized investment banking firms under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The investment banking firms hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed and variable rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Banks special direct investment and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs. 62 Table of Contents The following table sets forth information regarding the weighted average interest rates and the highest and average month end balances of our short term borrowings (dollars in thousands): Ending Balance Weighted Average Rate(1) Maximum Amount At Month End Yearly Weighted Average Balance Rate At or for the year ended December 31, 2006: Advances from the FHLB $ 4,865,466 5.15 % $ 5,053,982 $ 3,488,184 4.75 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings $ 10,212,993 5.17 % $ 12,483,929 $ 10,980,134 5.00 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2005: Advances from the FHLB $ 3,856,106 4.09 % $ 4,316,683 $ 3,260,556 3.88 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings $ 11,412,028 4.15 % $ 11,412,028 $ 10,115,764 3.70 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2004: Advances from the FHLB $ 1,487,841 2.71 % $ 1,777,110 $ 1,168,519 4.28 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings $ 10,170,082 2.15 % $ 10,285,738 $ 8,139,736 3.18 % (1) Excludes hedging costs. 63 Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF TERMS Active Trader The customer segment that includes those who execute 30 or more trades per quarter and have base pricing of $6.99 to $9.99 per trade.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest Rate Risk The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable rate and fixed rate assets, liabilities and derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. This analysis is based on complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense: Interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may re price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch. The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short and long term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income. Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize. Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, 93% of our total assets were interest earning assets. At December 31, 2006, approximately 66% of our total assets were residential mortgages and available for sale mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment. Our current strategy is to retain more originated mortgage loans on the balance sheet. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. The ALCO reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on loan production volumes and prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy. Our liability structure consists of transactional deposit relationships, such as money market accounts; certificates of deposit; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; free credits; wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities; and long term notes. Our transactional deposit accounts and free credits tend to be less rate sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities and money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and long term notes generally have fixed rates. We held $178.6 million in trading securities as of December 31, 2006. These securities, and the associated interest rate risk, are not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 68 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates.
