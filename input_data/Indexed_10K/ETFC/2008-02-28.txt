ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. GLOSSARY OF TERMS In analyzing and discussing our business, we utilize certain metrics, ratios and other terms that are defined in the Glossary of Terms, which is located at the end of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Strategy Our strategy centers on growing our global customer base and mitigating the risks associated with our balance sheet. We plan to grow our global customer base by appealing to retail investors, specifically those who are customers of large established financial institutions, by providing them with innovative, easy, low cost financial solutions and service. Our financial solutions include a suite of trading, investing, banking and lending products. Our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses. We believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength and will help restore customer and investor confidence in our franchise. We are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and or restructuring certain non core operations, primarily in our lending and institutional businesses. We believe these changes will better align our business with the global retail investor. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; the weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve; and the performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers; deepening customer acceptance of our products and services; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. 22 Table of Contents Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For the Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 Customer Activity Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 190.0 $ 194.9 $ 177.9 (3 )% Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 33.6 $ 28.2 0 % U.S. daily average revenue trades 156,006 137,715 83,604 13 % International daily average revenue trades 31,016 21,633 14,136 43 % Total daily average revenue trades 187,022 159,348 97,740 17 % Average commission per trade $ 11.71 $ 12.05 $ 13.82 (3 )% Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth(2) (116 )% 42 % 15 % * Enterprise net interest spread (basis points) 263 285 249 (8 )% Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 57.0 $ 45.4 $ 32.4 26 % Nonperforming loans as a % of gross loans receivable 1.37 % 0.28 % 0.17 % 1.09 % Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 508.2 $ 67.6 $ 63.3 651 % Allowance for loan losses as a % of nonperforming loans 121.44 % 90.52 % 186.24 % 30.92 % * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Customer cash and deposits, as well as retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005 which reduced both metrics by $564 million. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these items on our balance sheet. (2) Revenue growth is the difference between the current and prior comparable period total net revenue divided by the prior comparable period total net revenue. Customer Activity Metrics Retail client assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in retail client assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. As a result, this metric is impacted by both the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders, mass affluent and main street customers. Company Financial Metrics Net revenue growth is an indicator of our overall financial well being and our ability to execute on our strategy. The negative revenue growth during the period was due to lower revenue in our institutional segment, due to the loss on sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and increased provision for loan losses. Enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Enterprise interest earning assets, in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread, are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income. 23 Table of Contents Total nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable is an indicator of the performance of our total loan portfolio. Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is a general indicator of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. Changes in this ratio are also driven by changes in the mix of our loan portfolio. Significant Events in 2007 Citadel Investment of $2.5 Billion Including Sale of Asset Backed Securities Portfolio The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base. As a result, we believe it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash, which would in turn stabilize our balance sheet and our customer base. On November 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio, 84.7 million shares of common stock (1) in the Company and approximately $1.8 billion in 12 1/2% springing lien notes(2). We believe this transaction provided timely stability for our business and helped alleviate customer concerns. Developed a Plan to Restore Customer Confidence and Return to Growth We developed a plan focused on resolving the risks in our balance sheet and returning our primary focus to the retail investor. Our plan contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses to allow us to reinvest in growth initiatives within the core retail franchise. We believe the successful execution of this plan will restore customer confidence and return the Company back to a path of financial growth. Launch of Global Trading Platform We launched our Global Trading Platform, which provides the ability to buy, sell and hold foreign equities in local currencies to investors who seek liquidity and diversity in their portfolios. Our U.S. customers now have access to foreign stocks and currencies in six major international markets: Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom. International Expansion We continued our expansion into international markets with the launch of operations in Norway, the Netherlands and Singapore. In Norway, we now offer online trading of all Norwegian stocks registered on the Norwegian exchange Oslo B&oslash;rs, as well as stocks from Scandinavian markets in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the American markets. In the Netherlands and Singapore, we offer Dutch and Singapore investors direct access to the US stock markets through our Global Trading Platform. (1) The 84.7 million shares of common stock were issued in increments: 14.8 million upon initial closing in November 2007; 23.2 million upon Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act approval in December 2007; and 46.7 million shares are expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2008 as the Company has received all necessary regulatory approvals. (2) Included in the $1.8 billion issuance is $186 million of 12 % springing lien notes in exchange for $186 million of the Companys senior notes that were owned by Citadel. The $1.8 billion in 12 % springing lien notes includes $100 million in notes issued to BlackRock in connection with the transaction. The $1.8 billion in 12 % springing lien notes represents the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and does not include the additional $150 million of springing lien notes issued in January 2008 in accordance with the terms of the agreement with Citadel. 24 Table of Contents Enhanced Distribution Network We enhanced our distribution network by opening three new E*TRADE Financial Branches in the United States during the period. With the addition of the branches in Charlotte, NC; Houston, TX; and Minneapolis, MN, we increased the number of our nationwide financial branches to a total of 27. Introduction of the Max Rate Checking Account E*TRADE Bank introduced a Max Rate Checking Account which features an annual percentage yield up to 3.25%, unlimited check writing and free online bill pay, among other benefits. Ranked #1 Premium Broker by SmartMoney Magazine SmartMoney Magazine recognized the Company as the #1 premium broker in its 2007 broker survey. SmartMoney noted the Company for its improved service, new global trading capabilities, intuitive trade tools and easy search capabilities and numerous banking products. Increased Ownership of Investsmart We increased our ownership stake in Investsmart to approximately 48%. Investsmart is an India based financial services organization providing individuals and corporations with customized financial management solutions. Significant Events in 2006 Harrisdirect and BrownCo Customer Conversions We converted Harrisdirect and BrownCo customers to the E*TRADE Financial platform in the first and second quarters of 2006, respectively, which was a key step in the integration of our newly acquired customer base. This allowed us to deliver our functionality and services to these customers while reducing the costs associated with maintaining the legacy platforms. Enhancements to the Complete Investment Account We launched a series of functionality enhancements to the E*TRADE Complete Investment Account designed to help retail customers optimize their investing and borrowing relationships while evaluating their portfolio risk, including the Intelligent Lending Optimizer and the Intelligent Investing Optimizer and Risk Analyzer. We believe these new free tools will help customers better manage their security holdings, cash and credit products. Enhanced Distribution Network We enhanced our distribution network by opening eight new E*TRADE Financial Branches in the United States during the period. With the addition of the branches in Seattle, WA; Farmington, MI; Garden City, NY; Torrance, CA; King of Prussia, PA; Roseville, CA; Fort Lauderdale, FL; and Scarsdale, NY, we increased the number of our nationwide financial branches to a total of 24.

The new site features intuitive navigation, demonstrations of some of our most popular products and tools, direct access to account opening and customer service on every page and quick access to our powerful quotes and research functionality. Development of Automated Trading Strategies Functionality We developed new conditional orders functionality for retail customers including trailing stops for options and group orders such as contingent, one cancels all, one triggers all and one trigger one cancels other orders. When combined with the conditional order functionality already available to customers, such as trailing stops and bracketed orders for stocks, we believe this functionality will allow our customers to better manage risk. Move of Listing to the NASDAQ On December 27, 2006 we moved the listing of the Companys common stock from the NYSE to the NASDAQ under the symbol ETFC. We made this move to demonstrate our commitment to our customers and shareholders by aligning ourselves with the market that best meets their needs. As an industry innovator, NASDAQs value proposition parallels our own, leveraging technology to provide customers with low fees, superior service and fair, efficient and transparent market access and execution. Summary Financial Results Income Statement Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 2006 2007 vs. 2006 Total net revenue $ (378.2 ) $ 2,420.3 (116 )% Net operating interest income $ 1,609.1 $ 1,400.0 15 % Provision for loan losses $ (640.1 ) $ (45.0 ) 1323 % Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses $ 969.0 $ 1,355.1 (28 )% Commission revenue $ 694.1 $ 625.3 11 % Fees and service charges revenue $ 258.1 $ 238.8 8 % Operating margin $ (2,054.6 ) $ 1,000.8 (305 )% Net income (loss) $ (1,441.8 ) $ 628.9 (329 )% Diluted net earnings (loss) per share $ (3.40 ) $ 1.44 (336 )% The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance. The losses in our institutional segment caused by this crisis more than offset the considerable growth in our retail segment. Total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased 116% compared to the prior year due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. As a result of the decrease in net revenue, net income declined by 329% from the prior year to a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The retail segment delivered strong organic growth and overall results during the year ended December 31, 2007. Total retail segment income increased 14% to $789.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year. This growth in the retail segment was primarily driven by a 12% increase in net operating interest income and a 14% increase in commission revenue compared to the same period in the prior year. 26 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions) December 31, Variance 2007 2006 2007 vs. 2006 Total assets $ 56.8 $ 53.7 6 % Total enterprise interest earning assets $ 52.3 $ 49.5 6 % Loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets(1) 71 % 68 % 3 % Retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities(1) 61 % 64 % (3 )% (1) Loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets and retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities include balances not recorded on the balance sheet, such as margin and customer cash and deposits held by third parties. The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of $3.7 billion in loans receivable, net. The increase in loans receivable, net was due principally to growth in our one to four family loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted our previous focus on growing our balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balance. During this period, we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio. In connection with this strategy and the Citadel Investment, we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset backed securities, CDOs and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through January 1, 2010. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2007 Compared to 2006 Net income (loss) decreased 329% to a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. These losses in our institutional segment more than offset the increase in our retail segment income, which increased $94.0 million to $789.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. We report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking, lending and balance sheet management businesses. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Similarly, we report gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net are the result of activities in our operations, namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses, including impairment on our available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries. 27 Table of Contents The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, expense excluding interest, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Revenue: Operating interest income $ 3,569,711 $ 2,774,679 $ 795,032 29 % Operating interest expense (1,960,656 ) (1,374,647 ) (586,009 ) 43 % Net operating interest income 1,609,055 1,400,032 209,023 15 % Provision for loan losses (640,078 ) (44,970 ) (595,108 ) 1323 % Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses 968,977 1,355,062 (386,085 ) (28 )% Commission 694,110 625,265 68,845 11 % Fees and service charges 258,075 238,760 19,315 8 % Principal transactions 103,229 110,235 (7,006 ) (6 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (2,450,036 ) 55,986 (2,506,022 ) (4476 )% Other revenue 47,478 35,013 12,465 36 % Total non interest income (expense) (1,347,144 ) 1,065,259 (2,412,403 ) (226 )% Total net revenue $ (378,167 ) $ 2,420,321 $ (2,798,488 ) (116 )% Total net revenue declined by 116% to negative revenue of $378.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This decline was driven by the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income increased 15% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which includes margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in enterprise interest earning assets. Average loans, net as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 5% to 54% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. 28 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

Other consists of net operating interest earned on average stock conduit assets of $1.3 million, $303.5 million and $640.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.63 % 2.85 % 2.49 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.81 % 3.03 % 2.62 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 105.19 % 106.00 % 105.77 % Return on average: Total assets (2.34 )% 1.26 % 1.22 % Total shareholders equity (34.86 )% 16.56 % 17.70 % Average equity to average total assets 6.73 % 7.61 % 6.90 % Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 26% to $57.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Average loans, net grew 39% to $30.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Average loans, net grew as a result of our focus on growing real estate loan products in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balances of these assets. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 27% to $54.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily in retail deposits. Average retail deposits increased 30% to $26.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Increases in average retail deposits were driven by growth in the Complete Savings Account. We expect average retail deposits to continue to grow and replace repurchase agreements and FHLB advances as they mature. Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 22 basis points to 2.63% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of a challenging interest rate environment throughout the past 12 months as well as growth in our Complete Savings Account, which pays a higher interest rate than the majority of our other deposit products. We expect this decline to subside, as we focus on reducing our wholesale borrowings, which have a higher cost of borrowing when compared to deposits. Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Operating interest income: Operating interest income, gross $ 3,556,109 $ 2,763,041 $ 793,068 29 % Hedge income 13,602 11,638 1,964 17 % Operating interest income 3,569,711 2,774,679 795,032 29 % Operating interest expense: Operating interest expense, gross (1,957,456 ) (1,361,170 ) (596,286 ) 44 % Hedge expense (3,200 ) (13,477 ) 10,277 (76 )% Operating interest expense (1,960,656 ) (1,374,647 ) (586,009 ) 43 % Net operating interest income $ 1,609,055 $ 1,400,032 $ 209,023 15 % 30 Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio in the second half of 2007. We believe this deterioration was caused by several factors, which are described below. First, the combined impact of rising mortgage rates and home price depreciation in key markets contributed to the declining performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Second, concerns that began in the sub prime mortgage loan market spread to the broader credit markets beginning in the second half of 2007, resulting in a significant deterioration in the overall credit markets. This deterioration led to a dramatic tightening of lending standards across the industry, and general liquidity pressure for many mortgage lenders, some of whom ultimately ceased operations as a result. The factors described above dramatically reduced the ability of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans, specifically their home equity loans, therefore drastically increasing the risk of loss once a loan becomes delinquent. During the second half of 2007, we also observed a decline in the percentage of delinquent loans that cure prior to charge off or foreclosure once they have become delinquent. We attribute this change in behavior to the factors described above, which have significantly limited borrowers alternatives to avoid defaulting on their loans. In addition, because of the decline in value of the homes collateralizing our home equity loans, our ability to recover our investment by foreclosing on the underlying properties has diminished as well. We believe the provision for loan losses will continue at historically high levels in future periods as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets continues to impact the performance of our loan portfolio. Commission Commission revenue increased 11% to $694.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, which was driven by an increase of $66.4 million, or 14%, in our retail commission revenue. The primary factors that affect our retail commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, exchange traded funds, contract for difference and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. Institutional commission revenue is also impacted by negotiated rates, which differ by customer. Our institutional customers are provided with global execution and settlement services as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates. We expect our institutional commission revenue to decline substantially in 2008 as we plan to exit a significant portion of our institutional brokerage operations. DARTs increased 17% to 187,022 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Our U.S. DART volume increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Our international DARTs grew by 43% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, driven entirely by organic growth. Our international operations continue to be a strong growth contributor within our retail trading business, and we believe that over time they will become a significant component of our entire business. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs and now represent 16% of U.S. trading volume versus 13% a year ago. 31 Table of Contents Average commission per trade decreased 3% to $11.71 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation and win back campaigns, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges During the first quarter of 2007, the Company re defined the line item Service charges and fees by reclassifying certain fee like revenue items formerly reported in Other revenue into the Service charges and fees line item, now called Fees and service charges. The fee like revenue streams moved include payment for order flow, foreign currency margin revenue, 12b 1 fees after rebates, fixed income product revenue and management fee revenue. Fees and service charges increased 8% to $258.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was due to an increase in order flow payment, advisor management fees, foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees and mortgage servicing fees. We expect our account maintenance fee income to continue to decline over time as we have fewer customers who are subject to the fee. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 6% to $103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for 2007 compared to 2006, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount Gain on sales of originated loans $ 5,227 $ 12,018 $ (6,791 ) Loss on sales of loans held for sale, net (9,141 ) (6,775 ) (2,366 ) Gain (loss) on sales of loans, net (3,914 ) 5,243 (9,157 ) Gain (loss) on securities and other investments (2,911 ) 53,216 (56,127 ) Loss on asset backed securities sale to Citadel (2,241,031 ) (2,241,031 ) Loss on impairment (168,739 ) (1,504 ) (167,235 ) Loss on trading securities (33,441 ) (969 ) (32,472 ) Gain (loss) on securities, net (2,446,122 ) 50,743 (2,496,865 ) Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net $ (2,450,036 ) $ 55,986 $ (2,506,022 ) 32 Table of Contents The decrease in the total gain (loss) on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 36% to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in other revenue was due to an increase in the cash surrender value of Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI), an increase in fees earned in connection with distribution of shares during initial public offerings and software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business. Expense Excluding Interest The components of expense excluding interest and the year over year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 465,467 $ 469,202 $ (3,735 ) (1 )% Clearing and servicing 286,144 253,040 33,104 13 % Advertising and marketing development 149,573 119,782 29,791 25 % Communications 107,526 110,346 (2,820 ) (3 )% Professional services 106,691 96,947 9,744 10 % Depreciation and amortization 85,371 73,845 11,526 16 % Occupancy and equipment 93,189 85,568 7,621 9 % Amortization of other intangibles 40,472 46,220 (5,748 ) (12 )% Impairment of goodwill 101,208 101,208 * Facility restructuring and other exit activities 33,226 28,537 4,689 16 % Other 207,569 136,042 71,527 53 % Total expense excluding interest $ 1,676,436 $ 1,419,529 $ 256,907 18 % * Percentage not meaningful. Expense excluding interest increased 18% to $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by increases in clearing and servicing, advertising and marketing development, impairment of goodwill and other expense. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 1% to $465.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The slight decrease resulted primarily from lower incentive based compensation in the current year. 33 Table of Contents Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 13% to $286.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase is due primarily to higher loan balances during the period, which resulted in higher servicing costs, and increased trading activity, which resulted in higher clearing expenses. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 25% to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This planned increase is a result of expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. Impairment of Goodwill Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of this expense was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and was driven primarily by the shut down of the international portion of our institutional brokerage business. Other Other expense increased 53% to $207.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 is due primarily to higher expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and higher FDIC premiums. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased to an expense of $123.1 million for 2007 compared to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Other income (expense): Corporate interest income $ 5,755 $ 8,433 $ (2,678 ) (32 )% Corporate interest expense (172,482 ) (152,496 ) (19,986 ) 13 % Gain on sales of investments, net 35,980 70,796 (34,816 ) (49 )% Loss on early extinguishment of debt (19 ) (1,179 ) 1,160 (98 )% Equity in income of investments and venture funds 7,665 2,451 5,214 213 % Total other income (expense) $ (123,101 ) $ (71,995 ) $ (51,106 ) 71 % 34 Table of Contents Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the senior notes and mandatory convertible notes issued by the Company. We expect corporate interest expense to increase significantly in 2008 in connection with the $1.8 billion of 12 1/2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel. During 2007, we sold our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in SBI and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. (ISE) resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $736.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to an income tax expense of $302.0 million for the same period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was (33.8)% compared to 32.5% for 2006. For additional information, see Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expects the 2008 effective tax rate to increase compared to the tax rates for 2006 and 2007. The two principal reasons for the increased effective tax rate in 2008 are the non deductibility of a portion of the interest expense on the 12 1/2% springing lien notes as well as a reduction in the amount of tax exempt interest earned on state and local fixed income securities. Specifically, we expect the 2008 effective tax rate to be based on a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 37 38% plus an additional fixed amount of income tax expense of between $15 and $20 million. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net income from continuing operations increased 40% to $626.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. We experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in DARTs. We also experienced growth in customer margin balances. In addition, we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 41% in 2006 from 38% when compared to prior year. Revenue Net Operating Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 66% to $1.4 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to growth in enterprise interest earning assets coupled with an increase in enterprise net interest spread. The growth in enterprise interest earning assets was driven by increases in both loans, net and margin receivables. The increase in enterprise net interest spread was driven by changes in our mix of lending and funding sources. Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 8% to 64% for 2006 compared to 2005. Average retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 9% to 62% 2006 compared to 2005. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 17% to $45.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to a lower provision for our consumer loan portfolio in connection with the decline in the overall size of the consumer loan portfolio. 35 Table of Contents Commission Retail and institutional commission revenue increased 36% to $625.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative numbers of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, ETFs, CFDs and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. DARTs increased 63% to 159,348 for 2006 compared to 2005. Our U.S. DART volume increased 65% from 2005, driven by both our acquisitions of BrownCo and Harrisdirect as well as organic customer growth and engagement. Our international DARTs grew by 53% compared to 2005, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of total U.S. DARTs and represented 13% of trading volume versus 10% in 2005. Average commission per trade decreased 13% to $12.05 for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during 2006 compared to 2005 which resulted in a heavier weighting of Active Traders, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges increased 22% to $238.8 million for 2006 compared to the 2005. The increase in service charges and fees for 2006 was due primarily to an increase in the advisory service fee income and higher payment for order flow from improved option and equity trading volumes. This increase was offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees as our retail customers became more engaged and a greater number of customers exceeded the minimum activity levels required to avoid account maintenance fees. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 11% to $110.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in principal transactions resulted from higher trading volumes and market volatility which were offset slightly by a decrease in the average revenue earned per trade. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. Gain on Loans and Securities, Net Gain on loans and securities, net decreased 43% to $56.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decline in the total gain on loans and securities, net during 2006 was due primarily to our lower sales of mortgage and consumer loans compared to 2005. We retained a greater number of originated mortgage loans on the balance sheet in an effort to retain the customer relationship and drive growth in net operating interest income. The decline in gain on sales of consumer loans was also due in part to the sale of our consumer finance business in 2005. The increase in gain on sales of securities, net resulted from higher security sales volumes in 2006 compared to 2005. 36 Table of Contents Other Revenue Other revenue increased 5% to $35.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005, due primarily to an increase in our software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business. Expense Excluding Interest Expense excluding interest increased 35% to $1.4 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by an increase in the number of employees in our service organization, higher trading volumes and loan balances, facility restructuring activities and an increase in fraud related losses. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 23% to $469.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase resulted primarily from a higher number of employees in our service organization, a full year of expensing stock option expense(1) and increased variable and incentive compensation expense. These increases in compensation are in line with the growth and performance of our business and our focus on enhancing customer service with additional representatives. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 33% to $253.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was a result of higher trading volumes and higher loan balances during the period. Communications Communications expense increased 34% to $110.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to expenses associated with our newly acquired customers from Harrisdirect and BrownCo. In addition, we experienced higher variable expenses, such as quote services and trade confirmations, related to our increase in trading volume. Professional Services Professional services increased 25% to $96.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to third party support services, including technology and transitional service agreements, associated with our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility and restructuring costs were $28.5 million for 2006. During the year, we relocated certain functions out of the state of California. This expense represents certain facility costs as a result of ceasing operations at these locations in addition to severance charges for those employees to whom we communicated our plans and who were terminated as part of this relocation during the year. (1) In July 2005 we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Stock option expense was $22.1 million for 2006 and $13.7 for 2005. 37 Table of Contents Other Other expenses increased 127% to $136.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were due primarily to a 212% increase in fraud related losses to $31.2 million for 2006 and the favorable settlement of the Nomura Securities, Inc. (Nomura) litigation, which reduced other expense by $35.0 million in 2005. The fraud related losses were primarily identity theft situations which arose from computer viruses that attacked the personal computers of our customers. We did not suffer from a breach of the security of our systems. We reimbursed customers for their losses through our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee. These fraud schemes have impacted our industry as a whole. While we believe our systems remain safe and secure, we have implemented technological and operational changes to deter unauthorized activity in our customer accounts. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) decreased to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006 compared to income of $26.3 million for 2005. Other expense for 2006 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the funding of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions beginning in late 2005. Offsetting corporate interest expense was $70.8 million in gain on sales and impairment of investments. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in SBI and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. (ISE) resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense from continuing operations increased 31% to $302.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in income tax expense was principally related to the increase in pre tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 32.5% compared to 34.0% for 2005. The decrease in the 2006 tax rate compared to the 2005 tax rate is primarily due to benefits recognized on state tax refunds filed in one of our jurisdictions as a result of recent favorable court decisions, a reversal of valuation allowance recorded in prior years related to international operations and a continued decrease in our overall effective state tax rate due to our changing geographic footprint. Discontinued Operations Our net gain (loss) from discontinued operations was $2.0 million for 2006. During 2006 and 2005, our discontinued operations included operating results from our professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC and we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million, net of tax, in 2006. In 2005, discontinued operations also included operating losses from our consumer loan origination business and our proprietary trading business E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, both of which were sold or discontinued during 2005. 38 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW Retail The following table summarizes retail financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 2005 Amount % Retail segment income: Net operating interest income $ 986,657 $ 883,563 $ 445,124 $ 103,094 12 % Commission 546,228 479,876 339,654 66,352 14 % Fees and service charges 240,881 215,640 176,809 25,241 12 % Gain on loans and securities, net 10,609 36,698 63,705 (26,089 ) (71 )% Other revenue 40,725 38,348 52,129 2,377 6 % Net segment revenue 1,825,100 1,654,125 1,077,421 170,975 10 % Total segment expense 1,035,840 958,882 618,664 76,958 8 % Total retail segment income $ 789,260 $ 695,243 $ 458,757 $ 94,017 14 % Key Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 190.0 $ 194.9 $ 177.9 $ (4.9 ) (3 )% Customer cash and deposits (dollars inbillions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 33.6 $ 28.2 $ 0 % U.S. DARTs 156,006 137,715 83,604 18,291 13 % International DARTs 31,016 21,633 14,136 9,383 43 % DARTs 187,022 159,348 97,740 27,674 17 % Average commission per trade $ 11.71 $ 12.05 $ 13.82 $ (0.34 ) (3 )% Average margin debt (dollars in billions) $ 7.4 $ 6.8 $ 2.8 $ 0.6 9 % (1) Total customer cash and deposits, as well as total retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005, which reduced both metrics by $0.6 billion. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these line items on our balance sheet. Our retail segment generates revenue from trading, investing, banking and lending relationships with retail customers. These relationships essentially drive five sources of revenue: net operating interest income; commission; fees and service charges; gain on loans and securities, net; and other revenue. Other revenue includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we ultimately service retail customers through these corporate relationships. 2007 Compared to 2006 For the first three quarters of 2007, our retail segment performed extremely well. The core drivers of the business, including net new accounts, customer cash and deposits, DARTs, and retail client assets, were all on pace to end the year at record levels. However, we experienced a disruption in our customer base in the fourth quarter of 2007 which caused a decline in these core drivers. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we continue to anticipate credit related losses, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized, and will return to growth in 2008. Retail segment income increased 14% to $789.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This was due primarily to the growth in commission revenue and net operating interest income, slightly offset by a decrease in gains on loans and securities, net. 39 Table of Contents Retail net operating interest income increased 12% to $986.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was driven by customer cash and deposits, which generally translate into a lower cost of funds. The growth in customer cash and deposits during the first three quarters of 2007 was largely offset by the decline in customer cash during the fourth quarter of 2007. Retail commission revenue increased 14% to $546.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in commission revenue was primarily the result of increased trading volumes in the overall domestic equity market and in our international commissions where DARTs increased 43% from 21,633 to 31,016 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Retail commission revenue represented 79% and 77% of total commission revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Retail segment expense increased 8% to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This slight increase related to our targeted growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 3.6 million active trading and investing accounts and 1.1 million active deposit and lending accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, our retail trading and investing products contributed 70% for both years, and our deposit products contributed 24% and 22%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. 2006 Compared to 2005 Our geographically dispersed retail accounts grew 3% from 2005 to 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3.6 million active trading and investing accounts and 0.8 million active lending and deposit accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, our retail trading and investing products contributed 70% and 66%, respectively, and our deposit products contributed 22% and 19%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase in retail segment income during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 was due to an increase in net operating interest income and commission revenue, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Retail net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 98% to $883.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Average margin receivables increased 143% to $6.8 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. Higher margin balances generally translate into a higher interest rate earned on interest earning assets. Customer cash and deposits increased 19% at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Higher customer cash and deposit balances generally translate into a lower cost of funds as deposits increased in comparison to other borrowings. Net operating interest income growth included the impact of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Retail commission revenue increased $140.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. The increase in DART volumes was the result of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions as well as strong organic growth in domestic equity, international equity and option trades. Offsetting these increases were lower gains on loans and securities, net of $36.7 million for 2006. Retail segment expense increased $340.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase for 2006 was related primarily to the $29.6 million restructuring charge, an increase in the compensation expense due to an increased number of employees in our service organization and increased fraud related losses. 40 Table of Contents Institutional The following table summarizes institutional financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 2005 Amount % Institutional segment income (loss): Net operating interest income $ 622,398 $ 516,469 $ 426,138 $ 105,929 21 % Provision for loan losses (640,078 ) (44,970 ) (54,016 ) (595,108 ) 1323 % Net operating interest income (expense) after provision for loan losses (17,680 ) 471,499 372,122 (489,179 ) (104 )% Commission 147,882 145,389 119,180 2,493 2 % Fees and service charges 26,928 30,646 26,562 (3,718 ) (12 )% Principal transactions 103,229 110,235 99,175 (7,006 ) (6 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (2,460,645 ) 19,288 35,153 (2,479,933 ) * Other revenue 7,287 392 3,033 6,895 1759 % Net segment revenue (2,175,319 ) 777,449 655,225 (2,952,768 ) * Total segment expense 650,864 471,900 464,190 178,964 38 % Total institutional segment income (loss) $ (2,843,863 ) $ 305,549 $ 191,035 $ (3,149,412 ) * Key Metrics: Nonperforming receivable loans as a percentage of gross loans receivable 1.37 % 0.28 % 0.17 % 1.09 % Average revenue capture per 1,000 equity shares $ 0.494 $ 0.373 $ 0.458 $ 0.121 32 % * Percentage not meaningful Our institutional segment generates revenue from balance sheet management activities, market making and global execution and settlement services. Balance sheet management activities include purchasing loan receivables from the retail segment as well as third parties, and leveraging these loans and retail customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income. Retail trading order flow is leveraged by the institutional segment to generate additional revenue for the Company. 2007 Compared to 2006 As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our institutional segment incurred a loss of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The loss was driven primarily by losses in our asset backed securities portfolio of approximately $2.5 billion as well as provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Following the Citadel transaction, we no longer have exposure to asset backed securities; as such, we do not anticipate losses of this level to occur in future periods. However, we do continue to have exposure to mortgage loans and therefore expect the provision for loan losses to continue at historically high levels. Net operating interest income increased 21% to $622.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in average interest earning assets of 26% to $57.0 as of December 31, 2007. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses decreased 104% to a loss of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was due to the increase 41 Table of Contents in the provision for loan losses which increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was largely due to the deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Institutional commission revenue increased 2% to $147.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase was due to higher trading volumes as a result of volatility in global equity markets. Institutional commission revenue represented 21% and 23% of total commission revenue for year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect our institutional commission revenue, which is primarily earned through trade execution services, to decline significantly in future periods as we plan to discontinue providing institutional brokerage services. Fees and service charges revenue decreased 12% to $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is related to a $4.5 million decline in service fee income as a result of lower rates and lower home equity, credit card and CDO management fees. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Total institutional segment expense increased 38% to $650.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 and was due primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business. The increase was also driven by the expenses associated with certain legal and regulatory matters. 2006 Compared to 2005 Institutional segment income increased 60% to $305.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the growth in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 27% to $471.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was primarily a result of growth in interest earning assets, which were funded primarily by retail customer cash and deposit balances. Institutional commissions increased 22% to $145.4 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was due to a more favorable trading environment and the continued leveraging of our integrated institutional model with higher retail order flow. The increase in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue was offset by a planned decrease in gain on loans and securities, net of approximately $15.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, we determined that we would not sell securities at similar levels as 2005 because we were focused on growing our balance sheet. Total institutional segment expense increased 2% to $471.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005 and was predominantly volume related. Compensation and benefits expense increased due to increases in variable and performance based compensation and expensing of stock options. Clearing and servicing expense increased due to increased overall trading volumes and the increase in our loan portfolio. 42 Table of Contents BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Assets: Cash and equivalents(1) $ 2,113,075 $ 1,493,856 $ 619,219 41 % Trading securities 130,018 178,600 (48,582 ) (27 )% Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 11,255,048 13,677,771 (2,422,723 ) (18 )% Loans held for sale 100,539 283,496 (182,957 ) (65 )% Margin receivables 7,179,175 6,828,448 350,727 5 % Loans receivable, net 30,038,843 26,372,697 3,666,146 14 % Investment in FHLB stock 338,585 244,212 94,373 39 % Other assets(2) 5,690,654 4,660,223 1,030,431 22 % Total assets $ 56,845,937 $ 53,739,303 $ 3,106,634 6 % Liabilities and shareholders equity: Deposits $ 25,884,755 $ 24,071,012 $ 1,813,743 8 % Wholesale borrowings(3) 16,379,197 15,116,384 1,262,813 8 % Customer payables 5,514,675 6,182,672 (667,997 ) (11 )% Corporate debt 3,022,698 1,842,169 1,180,529 64 % Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities 3,215,547 2,330,696 884,851 38 % Total liabilities 54,016,872 49,542,933 4,473,939 9 % Shareholders equity 2,829,065 4,196,370 (1,367,305 ) (33 )% Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 56,845,937 $ 53,739,303 $ 3,106,634 6 % (1) Includes balance sheet line items cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations. (2) Includes balance sheet line items property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets. (3) Includes balance sheet line items securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. During the first quarter of 2007, we re presented our balance sheet to report margin receivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balance sheet. The remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokerage payables are now reported in the Other assets and Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities line items, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we re presented our balance sheet to report Investment in FHLB stock directly on the face of the balance sheet. This item was previously reported in the Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities line item. The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of $3.7 billion in loans receivable, net. The increase in loans receivable, net was due principally to growth in our one to four family real estate loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balance. During this period, we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio. The increase in total liabilities primarily was attributable to the increase in deposits, wholesale borrowings and corporate debt. The $1.8 billion increase in deposits was due primarily to the significant growth in money 43 Table of Contents market and savings accounts during the first three quarters of 2007, which was largely offset by the decline in deposits during the fourth quarter. The increase in wholesale borrowings contributed to the growth of the loans receivable, net during the first and second quarters of 2007. The $1.2 billion increase in corporate debt is due to the $1.8 billion of 12 1 /2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel in the fourth quarter of 2007. Loans Receivable, Net Loans receivable, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % One to four family $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 4,636,315 43 % Home equity 11,901,324 11,809,008 92,316 1 % Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 1,910,454 2,292,356 (381,902 ) (17 )% Marine 526,580 651,764 (125,184 ) (19 )% Commercial 272,156 219,008 53,148 24 % Credit card 90,764 128,583 (37,819 ) (29 )% Other 23,334 81,239 (57,905 ) (71 )% Unamortized premiums, net 315,866 388,153 (72,287 ) (19 )% Allowance for loan losses (508,164 ) (67,628 ) (440,536 ) 651 % Total loans receivable, net $ 30,038,843 $ 26,372,697 $ 3,666,146 14 % Loans receivable, net increased 14% to $30.0 billion at December 31, 2007 from $26.4 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to growth in one to four family loans during the first and second quarters. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. Therefore, we do not expect to grow our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future. In addition, we intend to allow our home equity and consumer loan portfolios to decline over time. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase sub prime(1) loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably end up acquiring a de minimis amount of these loans. As of December 31, 2007, sub prime real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio. During the first quarter of 2007, we entered into a credit default swap (CDS) on $4.0 billion of our first lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS we entered into provides protection for losses in excess of 10 basis points, but not to exceed approximately 75 basis points. In addition, our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party. (1) Defined as borrowers with FICO scores less than 620 at time of origination. 44 Table of Contents Available for Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities Available for sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. government sponsored and Federal agencies $ 9,330,129 $ 9,109,307 $ 220,822 2 % Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 1,123,255 1,108,385 14,870 1 % Total mortgage backed securities 10,453,384 10,217,692 235,692 2 % Investment securities: Asset backed securities 2,161,728 (2,161,728 ) (100 )% Municipal bonds 314,348 632,747 (318,399 ) (50 )% Publicly traded equity securities: Preferred stock 371,404 458,674 (87,270 ) (19 )% Corporate investments 1,271 24,139 (22,868 ) (95 )% Other 114,641 182,791 (68,150 ) (37 )% Total investment securities 801,664 3,460,079 (2,658,415 ) (77 )% Total available for sale securities $ 11,255,048 $ 13,677,771 $ (2,422,723 ) (18 )% Available for sale securities represented 20% and 25% of total assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Available for sale securities decreased 18% to $11.3 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, due primarily to the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Substantially all mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and Federal agencies are AAA rated and the majority of the asset backed securities portfolio consisted of AA or higher rated securities. In the future, we plan to allow our mortgage backed securities portfolio to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in the available for sale securities balance. Margin Receivables The margin receivables balance is a component of the margin debt balance, which is reported as a key retail metric of $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total margin debt balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Margin receivables $ 7,179,175 $ 6,828,448 $ 350,727 5 % Margin held by third parties and other 81,669 174,652 (92,983 ) (53 )% Margin debt $ 7,260,844 $ 7,003,100 $ 257,744 4 % 45 Table of Contents Deposits Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Sweep deposit accounts $ 10,112,123 $ 10,837,124 $ (725,001 ) (7 )% Money market and savings accounts 10,028,115 7,634,241 2,393,874 31 % Certificates of deposit(1) 4,156,674 4,737,253 (580,579 ) (12 )% Brokered certificates of deposit(2) 1,092,225 483,777 608,448 126 % Checking accounts 495,618 378,617 117,001 31 % Total deposits $ 25,884,755 $ 24,071,012 $ 1,813,743 8 % (1) Includes retail brokered certificates of deposit. (2) Includes institutional brokered certificates of deposit. Deposits represented 48% and 49% of total liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deposits increased $1.8 billion to $25.9 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, driven by a $2.4 billion increase in money market and savings accounts. Deposits generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives. During the first three quarters of 2007, the deposits balance increased $5.1 billion, primarily the result of the growth in our Complete Savings Account. This product created measurable growth in cash from new and existing customers; however, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base and the customer deposit balances began to decline. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we continue to anticipate credit related losses, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized, and will return to growth in 2008. The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $33.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Deposits $ 25,884,755 $ 24,071,012 $ 1,813,743 8 % Less: brokered certificates of deposit (1,092,225 ) (483,777 ) (608,448 ) 126 % Deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit 24,792,530 23,587,235 1,205,295 5 % Customer payables 5,514,675 6,182,672 (667,997 ) (11 )% Customer cash balances held by third parties and other 3,286,212 3,819,860 (533,648 ) (14 )% Total customer cash and deposits $ 33,593,417 $ 33,589,767 $ 3,650 0 % 46 Table of Contents Wholesale Borrowings Wholesale borrowings, which consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 8,932,693 $ 9,792,422 $ (859,729 ) (9 )% FHLB advances $ 6,967,406 $ 4,865,466 $ 2,101,940 43 % Subordinated debentures 435,830 385,502 50,328 13 % Other 43,268 72,994 (29,726 ) (41 )% Total other borrowings $ 7,446,504 $ 5,323,962 $ 2,122,542 40 % Total wholesale borrowings $ 16,379,197 $ 15,116,384 $ 1,262,813 8 % Wholesale borrowings represented 30% and 31% of total liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in other borrowings of $2.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to an increase in FHLB advances. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. During the first and second quarters of 2007, the Bank used these wholesale sources along with deposit growth to fund the increase in loans receivable. We expect total other borrowings to decline in future periods as we focus on replacing this funding with growth in retail deposits. Corporate Debt Corporate debt is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Senior notes $ 1,272,742 $ 1,401,592 $ (128,850 ) (9 )% Springing lien notes 1,304,391 1,304,391 * Mandatory convertible notes 445,565 440,577 4,988 1 % Total corporate debt $ 3,022,698 $ 1,842,169 $ 1,180,529 64 % * Percentage not meaningful. Corporate debt increased to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase is related to the $1.8 billion of 12 1/2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel at a discount of $481.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have established liquidity and capital policies. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. Deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and contingency 47 Table of Contents plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans. Capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities. During the second half of 2007, our institutional segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Consequently, this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter. The Company raised $2.5 billion in cash from the Citadel Investment, the majority of which was used to provide capital to the intuitional segment. While this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, we believe that the proceeds from the Citadel Investment as well as capital generated in our retail segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Changes in Cash and Equivalents In 2007, the consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased to $1.8 billion for the period ended December 31, 2007. Cash and equivalents at E*TRADE Financial Corporation, on a standalone holding company basis, increased $112.1 million to $251.7 million due primarily to an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $448.8 million and by financing activities of $1.4 billion offset by a decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion. Additionally, Converging Arrows, Inc. (Converging Arrows), a subsidiary of the parent company, had $60.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Corporate Debt Our current senior debt ratings are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service, B (watch neg) by Standard & Poors and BB by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS). The Companys long term deposit ratings are Ba2 by Moodys Investor Service, BB (watch neg) by Standard & Poors and BB (high) by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, is limited by regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2007, Converging Arrows had $60.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Converging Arrows is not restricted in its dealings with the parent company and may transfer funds to the parent company without regulatory approval. In addition to Converging Arrows, brokerage and banking subsidiaries may provide liquidity to the parent; however, they are restricted by regulatory guidelines. E*TRADE Bank is prohibited by regulations from lending to the parent company. At December 31, 2007, E*TRADE Bank had approximately $435.1 million of capital above the well capitalized level. In the current credit environment, we plan to increase the excess capital at E*TRADE Bank in order to increase our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining well capitalized status. Therefore, we do not expect to dividend this excess capital to the parent during the foreseeable future. E*TRADE Bank is also required by Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of tangible assets. E*TRADE Bank satisfied this requirement at December 31, 2007 and 2006. However, events beyond managements control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Banks ability to meet its future capital requirements. Brokerage subsidiaries are required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of our significant brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $730.8 million at December 31, 2007, of which $509.6 million is available for dividend while still maintaining a capital level above regulatory early warning guidelines. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm 48 Table of Contents commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Other Sources of Liquidity In addition to the liquidity available from subsidiaries, the parent company held $251.7 million in cash available as a resource. We also maintain $451.0 million in uncommitted financing to meet margin lending needs. There were no outstanding balances, and the full $451.0 million was available at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity for the Bank. At December 31, 2007, the Bank had approximately $10.5 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB. We have the option to make the interest payments of approximately $605 million on our springing lien notes in the form of either cash or additional springing lien notes through May 2010. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Certificates of deposit(1)(2) $ 4,159,985 $ 550,119 $ 222,867 $ 600,733 $ 5,533,704 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase(2) 7,528,168 332,424 186,862 1,330,275 9,377,729 Other borrowings(2)(3) 3,963,569 1,723,004 587,357 2,913,664 9,187,594 Corporate debt(4) 344,434 688,867 1,086,711 4,340,819 6,460,831 Operating lease payments(5) 38,767 70,248 46,103 67,686 222,804 Purchase Obligations(6) 72,125 19,687 2,913 94,725 FIN 48 liabilities 31,873 3,815 16,516 31,242 83,446 Total contractual obligations $ 16,138,921 $ 3,388,164 $ 2,149,329 $ 9,284,419 $ 30,960,833 (1) Does not include sweep deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts or checking accounts as there are no maturities and /or scheduled contractual payments.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $6.3 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under home equity lines of credit and $0.5 billion of unused credit card and commercial lines. As of December 31, 2007, outstanding commitments to originate and sell loans totaled $0.4 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, while the Company had no commitments to purchase loans. The Company had a commitment to purchase and sell securities of $0.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The Company also had equity funding commitments of $25.6 million as of December 31, 2007, based on investment plans of venture capital funds, low income housing tax credit partnerships and joint ventures. Additional information related to commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23 Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters. 49 Table of Contents Other Liquidity Matters We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support regulatory capital needs at our Bank, reduce holding company debt, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. RISK MANAGEMENT As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. The identification and management of existing and potential risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management framework, principles and practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. Risks cannot be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Companys risk tolerance. We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Corporate Risk Committee, consisting of senior management executives, monitors the risk process and significant risks throughout the Company. In addition to this committee, various enterprise risk committees and departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and enterprise risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). The ALCO reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in a borrowers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms. Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where it results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks. Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committees duties include monitoring asset quality trends, evaluating market conditions including those in residential real estate markets, determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, establishing underwriting standards, approving large credit exposures, approving large portfolio purchases and delegating credit approval authority. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate. Conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets deteriorated sharply during 2007, particularly in the second half of 2007. The significant and abrupt evaporation of secondary market liquidity for various types of mortgage loans, particularly home equity loans, has decreased the overall availability of housing credit. As a result, many borrowers, particularly those in markets with declining housing prices, have been unable to refinance existing loans. This combination of a decline in the availability of credit and a decline in housing prices creates significant credit risk in our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio. 50 Table of Contents Underwriting Standards Originated Loans We originate loans that generally fall into two categories: Mortgage Loans Prime credit quality first lien mortgage loans secured by single family residences. Home Equity Loans Prime credit quality second lien mortgage loans, including home equity lines of credit, secured by single family residences. We originate loans primarily through our mortgage lending sales force. The loans are almost entirely secured by a primary residence for the purpose of purchase money, refinance, debt consolidation, or home equity loans. We originate both amortizing and interest only mortgage loans; however, we do not originate negative amortization or option ARMs. We price our loans based on the competitive environment as well as the risk elements inherent in the loan. We evaluate criteria such as, but not limited to: borrower credit score, loan to value ratio (LTV), documentation type, occupancy type and other risk elements. In the second half of 2007, we adjusted our loan origination practices and pricing to significantly curtail originations of higher risk loans, particularly home equity loans with FICO scores below 660 or a CLTV greater than 89%. In addition, during the second half of 2007, we exited our wholesale mortgage origination channel and no longer originate loans through brokers. Our underwriting guidelines were established with a focus on both the credit quality of the borrower as well as the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan. We have designed our underwriting guidelines so that our one to four family loans are salable in the secondary market. These guidelines include limitations on loan amount, loan to value ratio, debt to income ratio, documentation type and occupancy type. We also require borrowers to obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan to value first lien mortgage loans. The table below summarizes the underwriting guidelines for the major originated loan types that we offered as of December 31, 2007(1). However, one to four family loans originated and held on our balance sheet, rather than sold to third party investors, are typically held to more stringent underwriting criteria. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we retained approximately 10% of the total one to four family retail loans originated. All of our home equity loans originations were retained in 2007 and 2006.

(2) Conforming loans conform to the standards set forth by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The single family conforming loans limit was $417,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. (3) Non conforming loans (or jumbo loans) have a loan amount greater than the standard set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Underwriting decisions are made based on the overall credit characteristics of the loan, and are not automatically approved if the loan meets the individual criteria. Therefore, the average credit characteristics of the loans we originate are stronger than the minimum criteria summarized in the table above. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the average retail loan originated had a FICO of 750 and an average CLTV of 69%. We supplement our loan underwriting process with a post closing quality control process. Our quality control process consists of a re verification of loan documentation, an underwriting and appraisal review, and other underwriting guideline reviews. This combination of an underwriting process and a quality control process allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to the prescribed underwriting guidelines. 51 Table of Contents Underwriting Standards Purchased Loans Our underwriting policies for purchased loans focus primarily on ensuring (i) adherence to the underwriting policies of the originator of the loan and (ii) that the loans meet certain minimum credit criteria. In order to confirm adherence to the underwriting policies of the originator, we obtain a copy of the underwriting guidelines used to originate the loans prior to purchase. We perform an analysis on a sample of the loans to ensure compliance with these guidelines, with a focus on: appraisal methodology and type; equity methodology and calculation; debt to income methodology and calculation; credit characteristics, including documentation type and credit score; employment and income requirements; and the exception policy of the originator. To the extent loans do not adhere to the underwriting policies of the originator, they are excluded from the purchase. When purchasing a portfolio of loans, primarily in the first half of 2007, our strategy was to attempt to exclude loans that we believe have a higher risk of credit loss. We review a detailed listing of the credit characteristics of the portfolio prior to purchase and attempt to identify higher risk loans. Our review criteria are not static and vary by purchase, but typically focus on excluding loans in the following categories: FICO scores below 640; combined loan to value ratios above 100%; debt to income ratios above 50%; and investor property loans. Even though our strategy focuses on excluding loans with a lower credit quality, we invariably end up purchasing an insignificant amount of loans that do not meet the credit criteria. This typically occurs in a portfolio purchase where the seller of the loans requires the purchaser of the loans to buy all loans in the pool. In the second half of 2007, we altered our business strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. As a result, we do not anticipate purchasing a significant amount of loans in future periods. However, we have significantly tightened our underwriting policies for any future loan purchases that do occur. These criteria focus on limiting the acquisition of loans with a high risk of credit loss and require the exclusion of loans with the following attributes: second lien; home equity line of credit; combined loan to value ratio above 80%; FICO score below 700 at time of origination; and documentation type is not full documentation. Loan Portfolio We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors include, but are not limited to: borrowers debt to income ratio when loans are made, borrowers credit scores when loans are made, loan to value ratios, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type, and loan type. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, loan to value ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In a deteriorating housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the loan to value ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk. We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably end up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub prime loans. As of December 31, 2007, sub prime real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans. As noted above, we believe loan type, loan to value ratios and borrowers credit scores are key determinates of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans(1) on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a combined loan to value ratio (CLTV) of 90% or higher or a FICO score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios. (1) Approximately 14% of the home equity portfolio is in the first lien position. For home equity loans that are in a second lien position, we also hold the first lien position on the same residential real estate property for less than 1% of the loans in this portfolio. 52 Table of Contents The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV(1) and FICO score(2) of our two main loan portfolios, one to four family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity LTV/CLTV December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 &lt; 70% $ 6,666,212 $ 4,957,948 $ 3,628,619 $ 3,877,377 70% 80% 8,450,977 5,603,921 2,086,277 2,055,692 80% 90% 202,133 127,519 3,871,249 3,400,903 &gt;90% 187,207 180,826 2,315,179 2,475,036 Total $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 One to Four Family Home Equity FICO December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 &gt; 720 $ 10,373,807 $ 7,370,649 $ 6,992,793 $ 7,058,794 719 700 2,089,014 1,411,458 1,898,924 1,802,172 699 680 1,585,613 1,073,235 1,668,427 1,434,947 679 660 943,538 619,449 757,016 830,433 659 620 503,573 382,033 566,030 659,063 &lt;620 10,984 13,390 18,134 23,599 Total $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 The increases in one to four family loans with FICO scores above 680 were driven predominantly by the purchase of loans in those categories during the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity Acquisition Channel December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Purchased from a third party $ 12,904,759 $ 8,679,568 $ 10,638,021 $ 10,541,250 Originated by the Company 2,601,770 2,190,646 1,263,303 1,267,758 Total real estate loans $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 One to Four Family Home Equity Vintage Year December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 2003 and prior $ 844,670 $ 1,044,221 $ 901,240 $ 1,176,320 2004 1,669,492 2,080,872 1,156,867 1,609,906 2005 3,084,336 3,657,194 2,790,423 3,582,871 2006 5,829,146 4,087,927 5,760,906 5,439,911 2007 4,078,885 1,291,888 Total real estate loans $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 (1) LTV/CLTV data is based on LTV/CLTV ratios at the time of loan origination, and has not been updated to reflect changes in property values since that time. (2) FICO score is based on FICO scores at the time of loan origination, and has not been updated to reflect changes in credit scores since that time. 53 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2007 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity Consumer and Other Total Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) December 31, 2007 $ 18,831 0.12 % $ 459,167 3.79 % $ 30,166 1.05 % $ 508,164 1.66 % December 31, 2006 $ 7,760 0.07 % $ 31,671 0.26 % $ 28,197 0.82 % $ 67,628 0.26 % (1) Allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the allowance for loan losses increased by $440.5 million from the level at December 31, 2006. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which deteriorated significantly during the second half of 2007. We believe this deterioration was caused by several factors, which are described below. First, the combined impact of rising mortgage interest rates and home price depreciation in key markets contributed to the declining performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Second, concerns that began in the sub prime mortgage loan market spread to the broader credit markets beginning in the second half of 2007, resulting in a significant deterioration in the overall credit markets. This deterioration led to a dramatic tightening of lending standards across the industry, and general liquidity pressure for many mortgage lenders, some of whom ultimately ceased operations as a result. The factors described above dramatically reduced the ability of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans, specifically their home equity loans, therefore drastically increasing the risk of loss once a loan becomes delinquent. During the second half of 2007, we also observed a decline in the percentage of delinquent loans that cure prior to charge off or foreclosure once they have become delinquent. We attribute this change in behavior to the factors described above, which have significantly limited borrowers alternatives to avoid defaulting on their loans. In addition, because of the likely decline in value of the homes collateralizing our home equity loans, our ability to recover our investment by foreclosing on the underlying properties has diminished as well. 54 Table of Contents The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge offs for the past five years (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Allowance for loan losses, beginning of period $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 Provision for loan losses 640,078 44,970 54,016 38,121 38,523 Allowance acquired through acquisitions(1) 1,547 2,748 Charge offs: One to four family (5,661 ) (616 ) (936 ) (186 ) (364 ) Home equity (168,163 ) (15,372 ) (3,929 ) (1,464 ) (75 ) Recreational vehicle (32,566 ) (25,253 ) (20,592 ) (18,419 ) (20,341 ) Marine (8,766 ) (6,463 ) (8,009 ) (6,003 ) (7,369 ) Credit card (11,608 ) (11,371 ) (17,286 ) (10,313 ) (919 ) Other (915 ) (2,768 ) (6,095 ) (13,956 ) (24,666 ) Total charge offs (227,679 ) (61,843 ) (56,847 ) (50,341 ) (53,734 ) Recoveries: One to four family 476 167 234 223 Home equity 4,368 822 526 310 Recreational vehicle 15,771 11,959 7,848 9,088 9,738 Marine 4,591 4,091 3,960 3,225 3,806 Credit card 957 750 380 141 1 Other 1,974 3,426 5,488 7,743 8,876 Total recoveries 28,137 21,215 18,436 20,507 22,644 Net charge offs (199,542 ) (40,628 ) (38,411 ) (29,834 ) (31,090 ) Allowance for loan losses, end of period $ 508,164 $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 Net charge offs to average loans receivable outstanding 0.65 % 0.18 % 0.26 % 0.30 % 0.41 % (1) Acquisition of credit card portfolio in 2004 and 2003.

Our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For one to four family loans, a charge off is recognized when we foreclose on the property. For home equity loans, our policy is to charge off loans when we foreclose on the property or when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. For credit cards, our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 increased by $158.9 million. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge offs on home equity loans, which was driven mainly by the same factors as described above. The continued pressure in the residential real estate market, specifically home price depreciation combined with tighter mortgage lending guidelines, will likely lead to a higher level of charge offs in the future. The following graph illustrates the net charge offs by quarter: 56 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due.

Loans held for sale are accounted for at lower of cost or market value with adjustments recorded in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item and are not considered in the allowance for loan losses. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our nonperforming assets, net increased $376.7 million from $87.6 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one to four family loans of $147.7 million and home equity loans of $197.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 when compared to December 31, 2006. We expect nonperforming loan levels to increase over time due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets. 57 Table of Contents The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter: The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net increased from 91% at December 31, 2006 to 121% at December 31, 2007. This increase was driven primarily by the allowance for loan losses in our home equity loan portfolio. In addition to nonperforming assets in the table above, we monitor loans where a borrowers past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan (Special Mention loans). Special Mention loans represented $612.2 million, or 2%, and $259.0 million, or 1%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are generally secured by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss should they become nonperforming. These loans are actively monitored, continue to accrue interest and remain a component of the loans receivable balance. The increase in Special Mention loans was due primarily to an increase in the 30 day delinquency category of real estate loans. We expect migration from this category to more serious delinquency classifications to continue due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets. Loss Mitigation Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio. This group is focused on providing loan modification alternatives to borrowers who qualify through our servicers. These programs include forbearance arrangements, rate and term modifications, re aging programs and short sale options. During 2007, an insignificant number of borrowers have utilized these programs. We are also focused on managing the exposure of undrawn home equity lines of credit. These efforts include, but are not limited to: Restricting lines of credit from additional draws when a borrower fails to make a timely payment. The criteria applied vary by loan servicer, but they generally range between 15 days past due and 30 days past due. Additional line management strategies under development that would restrict additional draws on open lines of credit for nonperforming loans based on a change in the property value of the collateral securing the loan, or a significant change in the borrowers financial condition and ability to repay the loan. 58 Table of Contents In addition, we are reviewing our purchased home equity loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. More specifically, home equity loans that become 30 days delinquent are reviewed for early payment defaults, violations of transaction representations and warranties, or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. Historically, the majority of these repurchase requests were honored by the original seller; however, beginning in the third quarter of 2007 our repurchase rate declined substantially. Securities We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe asset backed securities represent our highest concentration of credit risk. The table below details the average credit ratings by type of asset as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2007 AA or Higher A BBB BelowInvestmentGrade Non Rated Total Mortgage backed securities $ 10,896,343 $ 469 $ $ $ $ 10,896,812 Asset backed securities 64 58 122 Corporate bonds, municipal bonds and preferred stock 1,271,105 8,342 1,279,447 Total $ 12,167,448 $ 8,811 $ $ 64 $ 58 $ 12,176,381 December 31, 2006 AA or Higher A BBB BelowInvestmentGrade Non Rated Total Mortgage backed securities $ 10,531,264 $ 3,771 $ 10,370 $ 4,800 $ 2,667 $ 10,552,872 Asset backed securities 948,309 780,639 452,992 22,966 34,159 2,239,065 Corporate bonds, municipal bonds and preferred stock 1,412,150 63,061 30,632 1,505,843 Total $ 12,891,723 $ 847,471 $ 493,994 $ 27,766 $ 36,826 $ 14,297,780 During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio in connection with the Citadel transaction on November 29, 2007. This sale was the primary reason for the decline in available for sale securities rated below AA. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal control process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from advertising to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof. The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial losses and reputation risks. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships. Third party vendor arrangements are overseen by the Vendor Risk Management group. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conduct financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers. Fraud losses result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and attempt to identify fraudulent transactions. However, new techniques are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. 59 Table of Contents Among other security measures, we offer customers token based security. The tokens display a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds. The number on the display and a password must be used together to access the customers account. This system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss or actual losses depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from inadequate staffing, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in opportunity or actual losses could include the failure of a competitor to meet its customers needs, Internet performance issues, legal, reputation, public policy and strategic risks. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. Allowances for Loan Losses Description The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2007, our allowance for loan losses was $508.2 million on $30.2 billion of loans designated as held for investment. In addition to our banking loans, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin receivables. Judgments The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge off and loss experience, current industry charge off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Effects if Actual Results Differ Although we have considerable experience in performing these reviews, if managements underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. If our estimates understate probable losses inherent in the portfolio, this would result in additional expense. A 10% increase or decrease in the allowances would result in a $50.8 million charge or credit to income, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments Description We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans and securities, net for our banking investments and gain on sales and impairment of investments for our brokerage (other than those held for market making purposes) and corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized $168.7 million, $2.8 million and $40.3 million, respectively, of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Judgments When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. For illiquid securities, fair value is estimated by obtaining market price quotes on similar liquid securities and adjusting the price to reflect differences. For securities where market quotes and similar securities are not available, we use discounted cash flows. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing losses based on market conditions and other factors. Other than temporary impairment is recorded based on management judgment. Management evaluates securities based on market conditions and all available information about the issuer or underlying collateral. This information is used to determine if impairment is other than temporary. The determination that impairment is other than temporary is judgmental. Based on the facts and circumstances, companies could have different conclusions regarding when securities are other than temporarily impaired. Impairment of mortgage backed or asset backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security meets both criterion, we write the security down to fair value in the current period. Similarly, preferred stock is considered to be impaired and written down to fair value in the current period when in a continued loss position for a prolonged period of time and that loss position is deemed to be significant by management. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. Effects if Actual Results Differ Earnings could be influenced by the timing of managements decisions to recognize a security as other than temporarily impaired. Our estimates are based on the best available information. Over time additional information may become available and may influence future write downs. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized book were written down, we would record a loss of $501.2 million. Management believes that its estimates of other than temporary impairment are supportable and reasonable. See Note 6 Available For Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding securities. Valuation and Accounting for Financial Derivatives Description The Banks principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are 61 Table of Contents customer deposits and other short term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long term and short term interest rates and to convert fixed rate assets or liabilities to variable rates. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. Substantially all derivatives held on December 31, 2007 were designated as hedges. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative assets of $133.1 million and derivative liabilities of $200.3 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had derivative assets of $208.1 million and derivative liabilities of $78.7 million. Judgments Hedge accounting is complex and involves the interpretation of a significant amount of accounting literature. From time to time, new interpretations are issued, which result in new accounting methods applied to existing and new transactions. The implementation of SFAS No. 133, as amended, involves numerous judgments and Company level interpretations. We must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. Judgment is necessary to determine the accounting for our hedging strategies. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. Revised accounting interpretations of existing literature could materially impact our financial results. If 10% of the fair value of derivatives classified in liabilities were determined to relate to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the adjustment would reduce income by $20.0 million before taxes. Similarly, if 10% of the fair value of derivatives included in assets were determined to not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the result would be $13.3 million in additional pre tax income. The most significant effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment is the earnings volatility that would be created by marking the derivatives to market as interest rates change. Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances Description In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2007 we had a net deferred tax asset of $550.2 million, net of a valuation allowance of $91.8 million. At December 31, 2006 we had a net deferred tax liability of $58.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $38.3 million. 62 Table of Contents Judgments Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations, resolution with taxing authorities of uncertain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Effects if Actual Results Differ These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Description We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2007 was $1.9 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2007 were $430.0 million, which have useful lives between three and thirty years. Judgments In connection with our annual impairment test of goodwill, the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007, was determined to be impaired. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives on intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If managements estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occurs, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized. Valuation and Expensing of Share Based Payments Description We value and expense employee share based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each periods compensation expense attributed to these options. 63 Table of Contents Judgments We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are managements best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of employees forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by approximately 7%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods.

The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest earning banking assets and the interest incurred on our interest bearing banking liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous years average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous years volume.

These prepayments could significantly shorten the average loan lives and cause the actual timing of the loan repayments to differ from those shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Due in(1) &lt;1 Year 1 5 Years &gt;5 Years Total One to four family $ 216,771 $ 1,011,950 $ 14,378,706 $ 15,607,427 Home equity 260,377 1,278,439 10,362,508 11,901,324 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 103,614 482,923 1,323,917 1,910,454 Marine 26,604 124,695 375,281 526,580 Commercial 64,833 207,323 272,156 Credit card 90,764 90,764 Other 18,251 5,083 23,334 Total consumer and other loans 304,066 820,024 1,699,198 2,823,288 Total loans $ 781,214 $ 3,110,413 $ 26,440,412 $ 30,332,039 (1) Estimated scheduled principal repayments are calculated using weighted average interest rate and weighted average remaining maturity of each loan portfolio. 66 Table of Contents The following table shows the distribution of those loans that mature in more than one year between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Interest Rate Type Total Fixed Adjustable One to four family $ 3,699,424 $ 11,691,232 $ 15,390,656 Home equity 3,399,747 8,241,200 11,640,947 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 1,806,840 1,806,840 Marine 499,976 499,976 Commercial 207,323 207,323 Other 5,083 5,083 Total consumer and other loans 2,311,899 207,323 2,519,222 Total loans $ 9,411,070 $ 20,139,755 $ 29,550,825 Available for Sale and Trading Securities Our portfolios of mortgage backed securities and investments are classified into three categories in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities: trading, available for sale or held to maturity. None of our mortgage backed securities or other investments was classified as held to maturity during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Our mortgage backed securities portfolio is composed primarily of: Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) participation certificates, guaranteed by Fannie Mae; Government National Mortgage Association participation certificates, guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States; Collateralized Mortgage Obligations; Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) participation certificates, guaranteed by Freddie Mac; and Privately insured mortgage pass through securities;. We buy and hold mortgage backed trading securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. These securities are carried at market value and any realized or unrealized gains and losses are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Our investments classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. 67 Table of Contents The following table shows the cost basis and fair value of our mortgage backed securities and investment portfolio that the Bank held and classified as available for sale (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2007 2006 2005 CostBasis FairValue CostBasis FairValue CostBasis FairValue Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and Federal Agencies $ 9,638,676 $ 9,330,129 $ 9,375,444 $ 9,109,307 $ 9,687,666 $ 9,427,521 Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 1,170,360 1,123,255 1,127,650 1,108,385 1,014,582 995,891 Total mortgage backed securities 10,809,036 10,453,384 10,503,094 10,217,692 10,702,248 10,423,412 Investment securities: Asset backed securities 2,163,538 2,161,728 1,376,315 1,365,754 Municipal bonds 320,521 314,348 620,261 632,747 168,682 169,684 Corporate bonds 36,557 35,279 105,692 104,518 74,931 72,760 Other debt securities 78,836 77,291 80,623 74,880 78,989 73,485 Publicly traded equity securities: Preferred stock 505,498 371,404 455,801 458,674 290,240 288,365 Corporate investments 1,460 1,271 12,040 24,139 53,152 147,400 Retained interest from securitizations 980 2,071 2,930 3,393 22,444 23,878 Total investment securities 943,852 801,664 3,440,885 3,460,079 2,064,753 2,141,326 Total available for sale securities $ 11,752,888 $ 11,255,048 $ 13,943,979 $ 13,677,771 $ 12,767,001 $ 12,564,738 The following table shows the scheduled maturities, carrying values and current yields for the Banks available for sale and trading investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Within One Year After One ButWithin Five Years After Five ButWithin Ten Years After Ten Years Total BalanceDue WeightedAverageYield BalanceDue WeightedAverageYield BalanceDue WeightedAverageYield BalanceDue WeightedAverageYield BalanceDue WeightedAverageYield Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and Federal agencies $ N/A $ N/A $ N/A $ 9,638,676 5.06 % $ 9,638,676 5.06 % Collateralized mortgage obligations and other N/A 28 8.33 % 169 9.79 % 1,170,163 5.42 % 1,170,360 5.42 % Total mortgage backed securities 28 169 10,808,839 10,809,036 Investment securities: Municipal bonds(1) 266 3.24 % 211 2.56 % 12 4.06 % 320,032 4.59 % 320,521 4.59 % Corporate debt 11,211 2.38 % N/A N/A 25,346 5.71 % 36,557 4.69 % Other debt securities 609 3.47 % 249 4.00 % 77,978 4.38 % N/A 78,836 4.37 % Publicly traded equity securities Preferred stock(2) N/A N/A N/A 505,498 5.42 % 505,498 5.42 % Corporate investments(3) N/A N/A N/A 1,460 4.42 % 1,460 4.42 % Retained interests from securitizations N/A N/A N/A 980 2.00 % 980 2.00 % Total investment securities 12,086 460 77,990 853,316 943,852 Total available for sale securities $ 12,086 $ 488 $ 78,159 $ 11,662,155 $ 11,752,888 (1) Yields on tax exempt obligations are computed on a tax equivalent basis.

In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements. We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. In part, the FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances on the security of FHLB stock and various home mortgages and other assets principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2007, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $7.0 billion at interest rates ranging from 3.71% to 5.56% and at a weighted average rate of 4.80%. We also raise funds by selling securities to nationally recognized investment banking firms under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The investment banking firms hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed and variable rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Banks term investment option and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs. The following table sets forth information regarding the weighted average interest rates and the highest and average month end balances of our short term borrowings (dollars in thousands): EndingBalance Weighted AverageRate(1) MaximumAmount AtMonth End Yearly Weighted Average Balance Rate At or for the year ended December 31, 2007: Advances from the FHLB $ 6,967,406 4.80 % $ 9,959,297 $ 7,071,762 5.15 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings(2) $ 9,371,975 5.11 % $ 14,593,923 $ 12,261,145 5.25 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2006: Advances from the FHLB $ 4,865,466 5.15 % $ 5,053,982 $ 3,488,184 4.75 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings(2) $ 10,212,993 5.17 % $ 12,483,929 $ 10,980,134 5.00 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2005: Advances from the FHLB $ 3,856,106 4.09 % $ 4,316,683 $ 3,260,556 3.88 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings(2) $ 11,412,028 4.15 % $ 11,412,028 $ 10,115,764 3.70 % (1) Excludes hedging costs.

Taxable equivalent interest adjustment The operating interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal and or state income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement of income (loss), as that is not permitted under GAAP. Tier 1 Capital Adjusted equity capital used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios at E*TRADE Bank as required by the OTS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest Rate Risk The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable rate and fixed rate assets and liabilities and we utilize derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense: Interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may re price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch. The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short and long term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income. Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize. Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2007, 92% of our total assets were enterprise interest earning assets. At December 31, 2007, approximately 67% of our total assets were residential real estate loans and available for sale mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment. When real estate loans prepay, unamortized premiums are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of unamortized premiums may result in lower than anticipated yields. E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on loan production volumes and prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy. Our liability structure consists of transactional deposit relationships, such as savings and money market accounts; certificates of deposit; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; customer payables; wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities; and long term notes. Our transactional deposit accounts and customer payables tend to be less rate sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities and money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and long term notes generally have fixed rates. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying 74 Table of Contents notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Strategy Our strategy centers on growing our global customer base and mitigating the risks associated with our balance sheet. We plan to grow our global customer base by appealing to retail investors, specifically those who are customers of large established financial institutions, by providing them with innovative, easy, low cost financial solutions and service. Our financial solutions include a suite of trading, investing, banking and lending products. Our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses. We believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength and will help restore customer and investor confidence in our franchise. We are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and or restructuring certain non core operations, primarily in our lending and institutional businesses. We believe these changes will better align our business with the global retail investor. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; the weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve; and the performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers; deepening customer acceptance of our products and services; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. 22 Table of Contents Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For the Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 Customer Activity Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 190.0 $ 194.9 $ 177.9 (3 )% Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 33.6 $ 28.2 0 % U.S. daily average revenue trades 156,006 137,715 83,604 13 % International daily average revenue trades 31,016 21,633 14,136 43 % Total daily average revenue trades 187,022 159,348 97,740 17 % Average commission per trade $ 11.71 $ 12.05 $ 13.82 (3 )% Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth(2) (116 )% 42 % 15 % * Enterprise net interest spread (basis points) 263 285 249 (8 )% Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 57.0 $ 45.4 $ 32.4 26 % Nonperforming loans as a % of gross loans receivable 1.37 % 0.28 % 0.17 % 1.09 % Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 508.2 $ 67.6 $ 63.3 651 % Allowance for loan losses as a % of nonperforming loans 121.44 % 90.52 % 186.24 % 30.92 % * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Customer cash and deposits, as well as retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005 which reduced both metrics by $564 million. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these items on our balance sheet. (2) Revenue growth is the difference between the current and prior comparable period total net revenue divided by the prior comparable period total net revenue. Customer Activity Metrics Retail client assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in retail client assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. As a result, this metric is impacted by both the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders, mass affluent and main street customers. Company Financial Metrics Net revenue growth is an indicator of our overall financial well being and our ability to execute on our strategy. The negative revenue growth during the period was due to lower revenue in our institutional segment, due to the loss on sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and increased provision for loan losses. Enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Enterprise interest earning assets, in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread, are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income. 23 Table of Contents Total nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable is an indicator of the performance of our total loan portfolio. Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is a general indicator of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. Changes in this ratio are also driven by changes in the mix of our loan portfolio. Significant Events in 2007 Citadel Investment of $2.5 Billion Including Sale of Asset Backed Securities Portfolio The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base. As a result, we believe it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash, which would in turn stabilize our balance sheet and our customer base. On November 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio, 84.7 million shares of common stock (1) in the Company and approximately $1.8 billion in 12 1/2% springing lien notes(2). We believe this transaction provided timely stability for our business and helped alleviate customer concerns. Developed a Plan to Restore Customer Confidence and Return to Growth We developed a plan focused on resolving the risks in our balance sheet and returning our primary focus to the retail investor. Our plan contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses to allow us to reinvest in growth initiatives within the core retail franchise. We believe the successful execution of this plan will restore customer confidence and return the Company back to a path of financial growth. Launch of Global Trading Platform We launched our Global Trading Platform, which provides the ability to buy, sell and hold foreign equities in local currencies to investors who seek liquidity and diversity in their portfolios. Our U.S. customers now have access to foreign stocks and currencies in six major international markets: Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom. International Expansion We continued our expansion into international markets with the launch of operations in Norway, the Netherlands and Singapore. In Norway, we now offer online trading of all Norwegian stocks registered on the Norwegian exchange Oslo B&oslash;rs, as well as stocks from Scandinavian markets in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the American markets. In the Netherlands and Singapore, we offer Dutch and Singapore investors direct access to the US stock markets through our Global Trading Platform. (1) The 84.7 million shares of common stock were issued in increments: 14.8 million upon initial closing in November 2007; 23.2 million upon Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act approval in December 2007; and 46.7 million shares are expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2008 as the Company has received all necessary regulatory approvals.

Summary Financial Results Income Statement Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 2006 2007 vs. 2006 Total net revenue $ (378.2 ) $ 2,420.3 (116 )% Net operating interest income $ 1,609.1 $ 1,400.0 15 % Provision for loan losses $ (640.1 ) $ (45.0 ) 1323 % Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses $ 969.0 $ 1,355.1 (28 )% Commission revenue $ 694.1 $ 625.3 11 % Fees and service charges revenue $ 258.1 $ 238.8 8 % Operating margin $ (2,054.6 ) $ 1,000.8 (305 )% Net income (loss) $ (1,441.8 ) $ 628.9 (329 )% Diluted net earnings (loss) per share $ (3.40 ) $ 1.44 (336 )% The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance. The losses in our institutional segment caused by this crisis more than offset the considerable growth in our retail segment. Total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased 116% compared to the prior year due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. As a result of the decrease in net revenue, net income declined by 329% from the prior year to a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The retail segment delivered strong organic growth and overall results during the year ended December 31, 2007. Total retail segment income increased 14% to $789.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year. This growth in the retail segment was primarily driven by a 12% increase in net operating interest income and a 14% increase in commission revenue compared to the same period in the prior year. 26 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions) December 31, Variance 2007 2006 2007 vs. 2006 Total assets $ 56.8 $ 53.7 6 % Total enterprise interest earning assets $ 52.3 $ 49.5 6 % Loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets(1) 71 % 68 % 3 % Retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities(1) 61 % 64 % (3 )% (1) Loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets and retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities include balances not recorded on the balance sheet, such as margin and customer cash and deposits held by third parties. The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of $3.7 billion in loans receivable, net. The increase in loans receivable, net was due principally to growth in our one to four family loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted our previous focus on growing our balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balance. During this period, we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio. In connection with this strategy and the Citadel Investment, we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset backed securities, CDOs and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through January 1, 2010. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2007 Compared to 2006 Net income (loss) decreased 329% to a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. These losses in our institutional segment more than offset the increase in our retail segment income, which increased $94.0 million to $789.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. We report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking, lending and balance sheet management businesses. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Similarly, we report gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net are the result of activities in our operations, namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses, including impairment on our available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries. 27 Table of Contents The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, expense excluding interest, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Revenue: Operating interest income $ 3,569,711 $ 2,774,679 $ 795,032 29 % Operating interest expense (1,960,656 ) (1,374,647 ) (586,009 ) 43 % Net operating interest income 1,609,055 1,400,032 209,023 15 % Provision for loan losses (640,078 ) (44,970 ) (595,108 ) 1323 % Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses 968,977 1,355,062 (386,085 ) (28 )% Commission 694,110 625,265 68,845 11 % Fees and service charges 258,075 238,760 19,315 8 % Principal transactions 103,229 110,235 (7,006 ) (6 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (2,450,036 ) 55,986 (2,506,022 ) (4476 )% Other revenue 47,478 35,013 12,465 36 % Total non interest income (expense) (1,347,144 ) 1,065,259 (2,412,403 ) (226 )% Total net revenue $ (378,167 ) $ 2,420,321 $ (2,798,488 ) (116 )% Total net revenue declined by 116% to negative revenue of $378.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This decline was driven by the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income increased 15% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which includes margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in enterprise interest earning assets. Average loans, net as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 5% to 54% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. 28 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

Other consists of net operating interest earned on average stock conduit assets of $1.3 million, $303.5 million and $640.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.63 % 2.85 % 2.49 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.81 % 3.03 % 2.62 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 105.19 % 106.00 % 105.77 % Return on average: Total assets (2.34 )% 1.26 % 1.22 % Total shareholders equity (34.86 )% 16.56 % 17.70 % Average equity to average total assets 6.73 % 7.61 % 6.90 % Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 26% to $57.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Average loans, net grew 39% to $30.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Average loans, net grew as a result of our focus on growing real estate loan products in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balances of these assets. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 27% to $54.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily in retail deposits. Average retail deposits increased 30% to $26.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Increases in average retail deposits were driven by growth in the Complete Savings Account. We expect average retail deposits to continue to grow and replace repurchase agreements and FHLB advances as they mature. Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 22 basis points to 2.63% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of a challenging interest rate environment throughout the past 12 months as well as growth in our Complete Savings Account, which pays a higher interest rate than the majority of our other deposit products. We expect this decline to subside, as we focus on reducing our wholesale borrowings, which have a higher cost of borrowing when compared to deposits. Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Operating interest income: Operating interest income, gross $ 3,556,109 $ 2,763,041 $ 793,068 29 % Hedge income 13,602 11,638 1,964 17 % Operating interest income 3,569,711 2,774,679 795,032 29 % Operating interest expense: Operating interest expense, gross (1,957,456 ) (1,361,170 ) (596,286 ) 44 % Hedge expense (3,200 ) (13,477 ) 10,277 (76 )% Operating interest expense (1,960,656 ) (1,374,647 ) (586,009 ) 43 % Net operating interest income $ 1,609,055 $ 1,400,032 $ 209,023 15 % 30 Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio in the second half of 2007. We believe this deterioration was caused by several factors, which are described below. First, the combined impact of rising mortgage rates and home price depreciation in key markets contributed to the declining performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Second, concerns that began in the sub prime mortgage loan market spread to the broader credit markets beginning in the second half of 2007, resulting in a significant deterioration in the overall credit markets. This deterioration led to a dramatic tightening of lending standards across the industry, and general liquidity pressure for many mortgage lenders, some of whom ultimately ceased operations as a result. The factors described above dramatically reduced the ability of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans, specifically their home equity loans, therefore drastically increasing the risk of loss once a loan becomes delinquent. During the second half of 2007, we also observed a decline in the percentage of delinquent loans that cure prior to charge off or foreclosure once they have become delinquent. We attribute this change in behavior to the factors described above, which have significantly limited borrowers alternatives to avoid defaulting on their loans. In addition, because of the decline in value of the homes collateralizing our home equity loans, our ability to recover our investment by foreclosing on the underlying properties has diminished as well. We believe the provision for loan losses will continue at historically high levels in future periods as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets continues to impact the performance of our loan portfolio. Commission Commission revenue increased 11% to $694.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, which was driven by an increase of $66.4 million, or 14%, in our retail commission revenue. The primary factors that affect our retail commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, exchange traded funds, contract for difference and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. Institutional commission revenue is also impacted by negotiated rates, which differ by customer. Our institutional customers are provided with global execution and settlement services as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates. We expect our institutional commission revenue to decline substantially in 2008 as we plan to exit a significant portion of our institutional brokerage operations. DARTs increased 17% to 187,022 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Our U.S. DART volume increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Our international DARTs grew by 43% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, driven entirely by organic growth. Our international operations continue to be a strong growth contributor within our retail trading business, and we believe that over time they will become a significant component of our entire business. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs and now represent 16% of U.S. trading volume versus 13% a year ago. 31 Table of Contents Average commission per trade decreased 3% to $11.71 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation and win back campaigns, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges During the first quarter of 2007, the Company re defined the line item Service charges and fees by reclassifying certain fee like revenue items formerly reported in Other revenue into the Service charges and fees line item, now called Fees and service charges. The fee like revenue streams moved include payment for order flow, foreign currency margin revenue, 12b 1 fees after rebates, fixed income product revenue and management fee revenue. Fees and service charges increased 8% to $258.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was due to an increase in order flow payment, advisor management fees, foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees and mortgage servicing fees. We expect our account maintenance fee income to continue to decline over time as we have fewer customers who are subject to the fee. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 6% to $103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for 2007 compared to 2006, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount Gain on sales of originated loans $ 5,227 $ 12,018 $ (6,791 ) Loss on sales of loans held for sale, net (9,141 ) (6,775 ) (2,366 ) Gain (loss) on sales of loans, net (3,914 ) 5,243 (9,157 ) Gain (loss) on securities and other investments (2,911 ) 53,216 (56,127 ) Loss on asset backed securities sale to Citadel (2,241,031 ) (2,241,031 ) Loss on impairment (168,739 ) (1,504 ) (167,235 ) Loss on trading securities (33,441 ) (969 ) (32,472 ) Gain (loss) on securities, net (2,446,122 ) 50,743 (2,496,865 ) Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net $ (2,450,036 ) $ 55,986 $ (2,506,022 ) 32 Table of Contents The decrease in the total gain (loss) on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 36% to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in other revenue was due to an increase in the cash surrender value of Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI), an increase in fees earned in connection with distribution of shares during initial public offerings and software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business. Expense Excluding Interest The components of expense excluding interest and the year over year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 465,467 $ 469,202 $ (3,735 ) (1 )% Clearing and servicing 286,144 253,040 33,104 13 % Advertising and marketing development 149,573 119,782 29,791 25 % Communications 107,526 110,346 (2,820 ) (3 )% Professional services 106,691 96,947 9,744 10 % Depreciation and amortization 85,371 73,845 11,526 16 % Occupancy and equipment 93,189 85,568 7,621 9 % Amortization of other intangibles 40,472 46,220 (5,748 ) (12 )% Impairment of goodwill 101,208 101,208 * Facility restructuring and other exit activities 33,226 28,537 4,689 16 % Other 207,569 136,042 71,527 53 % Total expense excluding interest $ 1,676,436 $ 1,419,529 $ 256,907 18 % * Percentage not meaningful. Expense excluding interest increased 18% to $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by increases in clearing and servicing, advertising and marketing development, impairment of goodwill and other expense. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 1% to $465.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The slight decrease resulted primarily from lower incentive based compensation in the current year. 33 Table of Contents Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 13% to $286.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase is due primarily to higher loan balances during the period, which resulted in higher servicing costs, and increased trading activity, which resulted in higher clearing expenses. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 25% to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This planned increase is a result of expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. Impairment of Goodwill Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of this expense was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and was driven primarily by the shut down of the international portion of our institutional brokerage business. Other Other expense increased 53% to $207.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 is due primarily to higher expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and higher FDIC premiums. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased to an expense of $123.1 million for 2007 compared to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Other income (expense): Corporate interest income $ 5,755 $ 8,433 $ (2,678 ) (32 )% Corporate interest expense (172,482 ) (152,496 ) (19,986 ) 13 % Gain on sales of investments, net 35,980 70,796 (34,816 ) (49 )% Loss on early extinguishment of debt (19 ) (1,179 ) 1,160 (98 )% Equity in income of investments and venture funds 7,665 2,451 5,214 213 % Total other income (expense) $ (123,101 ) $ (71,995 ) $ (51,106 ) 71 % 34 Table of Contents Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the senior notes and mandatory convertible notes issued by the Company. We expect corporate interest expense to increase significantly in 2008 in connection with the $1.8 billion of 12 1/2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel. During 2007, we sold our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in SBI and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. (ISE) resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $736.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to an income tax expense of $302.0 million for the same period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was (33.8)% compared to 32.5% for 2006. For additional information, see Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expects the 2008 effective tax rate to increase compared to the tax rates for 2006 and 2007. The two principal reasons for the increased effective tax rate in 2008 are the non deductibility of a portion of the interest expense on the 12 1/2% springing lien notes as well as a reduction in the amount of tax exempt interest earned on state and local fixed income securities. Specifically, we expect the 2008 effective tax rate to be based on a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 37 38% plus an additional fixed amount of income tax expense of between $15 and $20 million. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net income from continuing operations increased 40% to $626.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. We experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in DARTs. We also experienced growth in customer margin balances. In addition, we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 41% in 2006 from 38% when compared to prior year. Revenue Net Operating Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 66% to $1.4 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to growth in enterprise interest earning assets coupled with an increase in enterprise net interest spread. The growth in enterprise interest earning assets was driven by increases in both loans, net and margin receivables. The increase in enterprise net interest spread was driven by changes in our mix of lending and funding sources. Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of average enterprise interest earning assets increased 8% to 64% for 2006 compared to 2005. Average retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 9% to 62% 2006 compared to 2005. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 17% to $45.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to a lower provision for our consumer loan portfolio in connection with the decline in the overall size of the consumer loan portfolio. 35 Table of Contents Commission Retail and institutional commission revenue increased 36% to $625.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative numbers of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, ETFs, CFDs and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. DARTs increased 63% to 159,348 for 2006 compared to 2005. Our U.S. DART volume increased 65% from 2005, driven by both our acquisitions of BrownCo and Harrisdirect as well as organic customer growth and engagement. Our international DARTs grew by 53% compared to 2005, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of total U.S. DARTs and represented 13% of trading volume versus 10% in 2005. Average commission per trade decreased 13% to $12.05 for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during 2006 compared to 2005 which resulted in a heavier weighting of Active Traders, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges increased 22% to $238.8 million for 2006 compared to the 2005. The increase in service charges and fees for 2006 was due primarily to an increase in the advisory service fee income and higher payment for order flow from improved option and equity trading volumes. This increase was offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees as our retail customers became more engaged and a greater number of customers exceeded the minimum activity levels required to avoid account maintenance fees. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 11% to $110.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in principal transactions resulted from higher trading volumes and market volatility which were offset slightly by a decrease in the average revenue earned per trade. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. Gain on Loans and Securities, Net Gain on loans and securities, net decreased 43% to $56.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decline in the total gain on loans and securities, net during 2006 was due primarily to our lower sales of mortgage and consumer loans compared to 2005. We retained a greater number of originated mortgage loans on the balance sheet in an effort to retain the customer relationship and drive growth in net operating interest income. The decline in gain on sales of consumer loans was also due in part to the sale of our consumer finance business in 2005. The increase in gain on sales of securities, net resulted from higher security sales volumes in 2006 compared to 2005. 36 Table of Contents Other Revenue Other revenue increased 5% to $35.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005, due primarily to an increase in our software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business. Expense Excluding Interest Expense excluding interest increased 35% to $1.4 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by an increase in the number of employees in our service organization, higher trading volumes and loan balances, facility restructuring activities and an increase in fraud related losses. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 23% to $469.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase resulted primarily from a higher number of employees in our service organization, a full year of expensing stock option expense(1) and increased variable and incentive compensation expense. These increases in compensation are in line with the growth and performance of our business and our focus on enhancing customer service with additional representatives. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 33% to $253.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was a result of higher trading volumes and higher loan balances during the period. Communications Communications expense increased 34% to $110.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to expenses associated with our newly acquired customers from Harrisdirect and BrownCo. In addition, we experienced higher variable expenses, such as quote services and trade confirmations, related to our increase in trading volume. Professional Services Professional services increased 25% to $96.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to third party support services, including technology and transitional service agreements, associated with our acquisitions of Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility and restructuring costs were $28.5 million for 2006. During the year, we relocated certain functions out of the state of California. This expense represents certain facility costs as a result of ceasing operations at these locations in addition to severance charges for those employees to whom we communicated our plans and who were terminated as part of this relocation during the year. (1) In July 2005 we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Stock option expense was $22.1 million for 2006 and $13.7 for 2005. 37 Table of Contents Other Other expenses increased 127% to $136.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were due primarily to a 212% increase in fraud related losses to $31.2 million for 2006 and the favorable settlement of the Nomura Securities, Inc. (Nomura) litigation, which reduced other expense by $35.0 million in 2005. The fraud related losses were primarily identity theft situations which arose from computer viruses that attacked the personal computers of our customers. We did not suffer from a breach of the security of our systems. We reimbursed customers for their losses through our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee. These fraud schemes have impacted our industry as a whole. While we believe our systems remain safe and secure, we have implemented technological and operational changes to deter unauthorized activity in our customer accounts. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) decreased to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006 compared to income of $26.3 million for 2005. Other expense for 2006 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the funding of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions beginning in late 2005. Offsetting corporate interest expense was $70.8 million in gain on sales and impairment of investments. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in SBI and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. (ISE) resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense from continuing operations increased 31% to $302.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in income tax expense was principally related to the increase in pre tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 32.5% compared to 34.0% for 2005. The decrease in the 2006 tax rate compared to the 2005 tax rate is primarily due to benefits recognized on state tax refunds filed in one of our jurisdictions as a result of recent favorable court decisions, a reversal of valuation allowance recorded in prior years related to international operations and a continued decrease in our overall effective state tax rate due to our changing geographic footprint. Discontinued Operations Our net gain (loss) from discontinued operations was $2.0 million for 2006. During 2006 and 2005, our discontinued operations included operating results from our professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC and we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million, net of tax, in 2006. In 2005, discontinued operations also included operating losses from our consumer loan origination business and our proprietary trading business E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, both of which were sold or discontinued during 2005. 38 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW Retail The following table summarizes retail financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 2005 Amount % Retail segment income: Net operating interest income $ 986,657 $ 883,563 $ 445,124 $ 103,094 12 % Commission 546,228 479,876 339,654 66,352 14 % Fees and service charges 240,881 215,640 176,809 25,241 12 % Gain on loans and securities, net 10,609 36,698 63,705 (26,089 ) (71 )% Other revenue 40,725 38,348 52,129 2,377 6 % Net segment revenue 1,825,100 1,654,125 1,077,421 170,975 10 % Total segment expense 1,035,840 958,882 618,664 76,958 8 % Total retail segment income $ 789,260 $ 695,243 $ 458,757 $ 94,017 14 % Key Metrics: Retail client assets (dollars in billions)(1) $ 190.0 $ 194.9 $ 177.9 $ (4.9 ) (3 )% Customer cash and deposits (dollars inbillions)(1) $ 33.6 $ 33.6 $ 28.2 $ 0 % U.S. DARTs 156,006 137,715 83,604 18,291 13 % International DARTs 31,016 21,633 14,136 9,383 43 % DARTs 187,022 159,348 97,740 27,674 17 % Average commission per trade $ 11.71 $ 12.05 $ 13.82 $ (0.34 ) (3 )% Average margin debt (dollars in billions) $ 7.4 $ 6.8 $ 2.8 $ 0.6 9 % (1) Total customer cash and deposits, as well as total retail client assets, have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of December 31, 2005, which reduced both metrics by $0.6 billion. This is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these line items on our balance sheet. Our retail segment generates revenue from trading, investing, banking and lending relationships with retail customers. These relationships essentially drive five sources of revenue: net operating interest income; commission; fees and service charges; gain on loans and securities, net; and other revenue. Other revenue includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we ultimately service retail customers through these corporate relationships. 2007 Compared to 2006 For the first three quarters of 2007, our retail segment performed extremely well. The core drivers of the business, including net new accounts, customer cash and deposits, DARTs, and retail client assets, were all on pace to end the year at record levels. However, we experienced a disruption in our customer base in the fourth quarter of 2007 which caused a decline in these core drivers. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we continue to anticipate credit related losses, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized, and will return to growth in 2008. Retail segment income increased 14% to $789.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This was due primarily to the growth in commission revenue and net operating interest income, slightly offset by a decrease in gains on loans and securities, net. 39 Table of Contents Retail net operating interest income increased 12% to $986.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was driven by customer cash and deposits, which generally translate into a lower cost of funds. The growth in customer cash and deposits during the first three quarters of 2007 was largely offset by the decline in customer cash during the fourth quarter of 2007. Retail commission revenue increased 14% to $546.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in commission revenue was primarily the result of increased trading volumes in the overall domestic equity market and in our international commissions where DARTs increased 43% from 21,633 to 31,016 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Retail commission revenue represented 79% and 77% of total commission revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Retail segment expense increased 8% to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This slight increase related to our targeted growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 3.6 million active trading and investing accounts and 1.1 million active deposit and lending accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, our retail trading and investing products contributed 70% for both years, and our deposit products contributed 24% and 22%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. 2006 Compared to 2005 Our geographically dispersed retail accounts grew 3% from 2005 to 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3.6 million active trading and investing accounts and 0.8 million active lending and deposit accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, our retail trading and investing products contributed 70% and 66%, respectively, and our deposit products contributed 22% and 19%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase in retail segment income during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 was due to an increase in net operating interest income and commission revenue, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Retail net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 98% to $883.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Average margin receivables increased 143% to $6.8 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. Higher margin balances generally translate into a higher interest rate earned on interest earning assets. Customer cash and deposits increased 19% at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Higher customer cash and deposit balances generally translate into a lower cost of funds as deposits increased in comparison to other borrowings. Net operating interest income growth included the impact of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Retail commission revenue increased $140.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. The increase in DART volumes was the result of the Harrisdirect and BrownCo acquisitions as well as strong organic growth in domestic equity, international equity and option trades. Offsetting these increases were lower gains on loans and securities, net of $36.7 million for 2006. Retail segment expense increased $340.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase for 2006 was related primarily to the $29.6 million restructuring charge, an increase in the compensation expense due to an increased number of employees in our service organization and increased fraud related losses. 40 Table of Contents Institutional The following table summarizes institutional financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 2005 Amount % Institutional segment income (loss): Net operating interest income $ 622,398 $ 516,469 $ 426,138 $ 105,929 21 % Provision for loan losses (640,078 ) (44,970 ) (54,016 ) (595,108 ) 1323 % Net operating interest income (expense) after provision for loan losses (17,680 ) 471,499 372,122 (489,179 ) (104 )% Commission 147,882 145,389 119,180 2,493 2 % Fees and service charges 26,928 30,646 26,562 (3,718 ) (12 )% Principal transactions 103,229 110,235 99,175 (7,006 ) (6 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (2,460,645 ) 19,288 35,153 (2,479,933 ) * Other revenue 7,287 392 3,033 6,895 1759 % Net segment revenue (2,175,319 ) 777,449 655,225 (2,952,768 ) * Total segment expense 650,864 471,900 464,190 178,964 38 % Total institutional segment income (loss) $ (2,843,863 ) $ 305,549 $ 191,035 $ (3,149,412 ) * Key Metrics: Nonperforming receivable loans as a percentage of gross loans receivable 1.37 % 0.28 % 0.17 % 1.09 % Average revenue capture per 1,000 equity shares $ 0.494 $ 0.373 $ 0.458 $ 0.121 32 % * Percentage not meaningful Our institutional segment generates revenue from balance sheet management activities, market making and global execution and settlement services. Balance sheet management activities include purchasing loan receivables from the retail segment as well as third parties, and leveraging these loans and retail customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income. Retail trading order flow is leveraged by the institutional segment to generate additional revenue for the Company. 2007 Compared to 2006 As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our institutional segment incurred a loss of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The loss was driven primarily by losses in our asset backed securities portfolio of approximately $2.5 billion as well as provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Following the Citadel transaction, we no longer have exposure to asset backed securities; as such, we do not anticipate losses of this level to occur in future periods. However, we do continue to have exposure to mortgage loans and therefore expect the provision for loan losses to continue at historically high levels. Net operating interest income increased 21% to $622.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in average interest earning assets of 26% to $57.0 as of December 31, 2007. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses decreased 104% to a loss of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was due to the increase 41 Table of Contents in the provision for loan losses which increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was largely due to the deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Institutional commission revenue increased 2% to $147.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase was due to higher trading volumes as a result of volatility in global equity markets. Institutional commission revenue represented 21% and 23% of total commission revenue for year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect our institutional commission revenue, which is primarily earned through trade execution services, to decline significantly in future periods as we plan to discontinue providing institutional brokerage services. Fees and service charges revenue decreased 12% to $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is related to a $4.5 million decline in service fee income as a result of lower rates and lower home equity, credit card and CDO management fees. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Total institutional segment expense increased 38% to $650.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 and was due primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business. The increase was also driven by the expenses associated with certain legal and regulatory matters. 2006 Compared to 2005 Institutional segment income increased 60% to $305.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the growth in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 27% to $471.5 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was primarily a result of growth in interest earning assets, which were funded primarily by retail customer cash and deposit balances. Institutional commissions increased 22% to $145.4 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was due to a more favorable trading environment and the continued leveraging of our integrated institutional model with higher retail order flow. The increase in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue was offset by a planned decrease in gain on loans and securities, net of approximately $15.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, we determined that we would not sell securities at similar levels as 2005 because we were focused on growing our balance sheet. Total institutional segment expense increased 2% to $471.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005 and was predominantly volume related. Compensation and benefits expense increased due to increases in variable and performance based compensation and expensing of stock options. Clearing and servicing expense increased due to increased overall trading volumes and the increase in our loan portfolio. 42 Table of Contents BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Assets: Cash and equivalents(1) $ 2,113,075 $ 1,493,856 $ 619,219 41 % Trading securities 130,018 178,600 (48,582 ) (27 )% Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 11,255,048 13,677,771 (2,422,723 ) (18 )% Loans held for sale 100,539 283,496 (182,957 ) (65 )% Margin receivables 7,179,175 6,828,448 350,727 5 % Loans receivable, net 30,038,843 26,372,697 3,666,146 14 % Investment in FHLB stock 338,585 244,212 94,373 39 % Other assets(2) 5,690,654 4,660,223 1,030,431 22 % Total assets $ 56,845,937 $ 53,739,303 $ 3,106,634 6 % Liabilities and shareholders equity: Deposits $ 25,884,755 $ 24,071,012 $ 1,813,743 8 % Wholesale borrowings(3) 16,379,197 15,116,384 1,262,813 8 % Customer payables 5,514,675 6,182,672 (667,997 ) (11 )% Corporate debt 3,022,698 1,842,169 1,180,529 64 % Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities 3,215,547 2,330,696 884,851 38 % Total liabilities 54,016,872 49,542,933 4,473,939 9 % Shareholders equity 2,829,065 4,196,370 (1,367,305 ) (33 )% Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 56,845,937 $ 53,739,303 $ 3,106,634 6 % (1) Includes balance sheet line items cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations. (2) Includes balance sheet line items property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets. (3) Includes balance sheet line items securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. During the first quarter of 2007, we re presented our balance sheet to report margin receivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balance sheet. The remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokerage payables are now reported in the Other assets and Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities line items, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we re presented our balance sheet to report Investment in FHLB stock directly on the face of the balance sheet. This item was previously reported in the Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities line item. The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of $3.7 billion in loans receivable, net. The increase in loans receivable, net was due principally to growth in our one to four family real estate loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balance. During this period, we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio. The increase in total liabilities primarily was attributable to the increase in deposits, wholesale borrowings and corporate debt. The $1.8 billion increase in deposits was due primarily to the significant growth in money 43 Table of Contents market and savings accounts during the first three quarters of 2007, which was largely offset by the decline in deposits during the fourth quarter. The increase in wholesale borrowings contributed to the growth of the loans receivable, net during the first and second quarters of 2007. The $1.2 billion increase in corporate debt is due to the $1.8 billion of 12 1 /2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel in the fourth quarter of 2007. Loans Receivable, Net Loans receivable, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % One to four family $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 4,636,315 43 % Home equity 11,901,324 11,809,008 92,316 1 % Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 1,910,454 2,292,356 (381,902 ) (17 )% Marine 526,580 651,764 (125,184 ) (19 )% Commercial 272,156 219,008 53,148 24 % Credit card 90,764 128,583 (37,819 ) (29 )% Other 23,334 81,239 (57,905 ) (71 )% Unamortized premiums, net 315,866 388,153 (72,287 ) (19 )% Allowance for loan losses (508,164 ) (67,628 ) (440,536 ) 651 % Total loans receivable, net $ 30,038,843 $ 26,372,697 $ 3,666,146 14 % Loans receivable, net increased 14% to $30.0 billion at December 31, 2007 from $26.4 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to growth in one to four family loans during the first and second quarters. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. Therefore, we do not expect to grow our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future. In addition, we intend to allow our home equity and consumer loan portfolios to decline over time. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase sub prime(1) loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably end up acquiring a de minimis amount of these loans. As of December 31, 2007, sub prime real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio. During the first quarter of 2007, we entered into a credit default swap (CDS) on $4.0 billion of our first lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS we entered into provides protection for losses in excess of 10 basis points, but not to exceed approximately 75 basis points. In addition, our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party. (1) Defined as borrowers with FICO scores less than 620 at time of origination. 44 Table of Contents Available for Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities Available for sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. government sponsored and Federal agencies $ 9,330,129 $ 9,109,307 $ 220,822 2 % Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 1,123,255 1,108,385 14,870 1 % Total mortgage backed securities 10,453,384 10,217,692 235,692 2 % Investment securities: Asset backed securities 2,161,728 (2,161,728 ) (100 )% Municipal bonds 314,348 632,747 (318,399 ) (50 )% Publicly traded equity securities: Preferred stock 371,404 458,674 (87,270 ) (19 )% Corporate investments 1,271 24,139 (22,868 ) (95 )% Other 114,641 182,791 (68,150 ) (37 )% Total investment securities 801,664 3,460,079 (2,658,415 ) (77 )% Total available for sale securities $ 11,255,048 $ 13,677,771 $ (2,422,723 ) (18 )% Available for sale securities represented 20% and 25% of total assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Available for sale securities decreased 18% to $11.3 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, due primarily to the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Substantially all mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and Federal agencies are AAA rated and the majority of the asset backed securities portfolio consisted of AA or higher rated securities. In the future, we plan to allow our mortgage backed securities portfolio to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in the available for sale securities balance. Margin Receivables The margin receivables balance is a component of the margin debt balance, which is reported as a key retail metric of $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total margin debt balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Margin receivables $ 7,179,175 $ 6,828,448 $ 350,727 5 % Margin held by third parties and other 81,669 174,652 (92,983 ) (53 )% Margin debt $ 7,260,844 $ 7,003,100 $ 257,744 4 % 45 Table of Contents Deposits Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Sweep deposit accounts $ 10,112,123 $ 10,837,124 $ (725,001 ) (7 )% Money market and savings accounts 10,028,115 7,634,241 2,393,874 31 % Certificates of deposit(1) 4,156,674 4,737,253 (580,579 ) (12 )% Brokered certificates of deposit(2) 1,092,225 483,777 608,448 126 % Checking accounts 495,618 378,617 117,001 31 % Total deposits $ 25,884,755 $ 24,071,012 $ 1,813,743 8 % (1) Includes retail brokered certificates of deposit. (2) Includes institutional brokered certificates of deposit. Deposits represented 48% and 49% of total liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deposits increased $1.8 billion to $25.9 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, driven by a $2.4 billion increase in money market and savings accounts. Deposits generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives. During the first three quarters of 2007, the deposits balance increased $5.1 billion, primarily the result of the growth in our Complete Savings Account. This product created measurable growth in cash from new and existing customers; however, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base and the customer deposit balances began to decline. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we continue to anticipate credit related losses, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized, and will return to growth in 2008. The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $33.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Deposits $ 25,884,755 $ 24,071,012 $ 1,813,743 8 % Less: brokered certificates of deposit (1,092,225 ) (483,777 ) (608,448 ) 126 % Deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit 24,792,530 23,587,235 1,205,295 5 % Customer payables 5,514,675 6,182,672 (667,997 ) (11 )% Customer cash balances held by third parties and other 3,286,212 3,819,860 (533,648 ) (14 )% Total customer cash and deposits $ 33,593,417 $ 33,589,767 $ 3,650 0 % 46 Table of Contents Wholesale Borrowings Wholesale borrowings, which consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 8,932,693 $ 9,792,422 $ (859,729 ) (9 )% FHLB advances $ 6,967,406 $ 4,865,466 $ 2,101,940 43 % Subordinated debentures 435,830 385,502 50,328 13 % Other 43,268 72,994 (29,726 ) (41 )% Total other borrowings $ 7,446,504 $ 5,323,962 $ 2,122,542 40 % Total wholesale borrowings $ 16,379,197 $ 15,116,384 $ 1,262,813 8 % Wholesale borrowings represented 30% and 31% of total liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in other borrowings of $2.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to an increase in FHLB advances. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. During the first and second quarters of 2007, the Bank used these wholesale sources along with deposit growth to fund the increase in loans receivable. We expect total other borrowings to decline in future periods as we focus on replacing this funding with growth in retail deposits. Corporate Debt Corporate debt is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 Amount % Senior notes $ 1,272,742 $ 1,401,592 $ (128,850 ) (9 )% Springing lien notes 1,304,391 1,304,391 * Mandatory convertible notes 445,565 440,577 4,988 1 % Total corporate debt $ 3,022,698 $ 1,842,169 $ 1,180,529 64 % * Percentage not meaningful. Corporate debt increased to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase is related to the $1.8 billion of 12 1/2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel at a discount of $481.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have established liquidity and capital policies. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. Deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and contingency 47 Table of Contents plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans. Capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities. During the second half of 2007, our institutional segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Consequently, this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter. The Company raised $2.5 billion in cash from the Citadel Investment, the majority of which was used to provide capital to the intuitional segment. While this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, we believe that the proceeds from the Citadel Investment as well as capital generated in our retail segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Changes in Cash and Equivalents In 2007, the consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased to $1.8 billion for the period ended December 31, 2007. Cash and equivalents at E*TRADE Financial Corporation, on a standalone holding company basis, increased $112.1 million to $251.7 million due primarily to an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $448.8 million and by financing activities of $1.4 billion offset by a decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion. Additionally, Converging Arrows, Inc. (Converging Arrows), a subsidiary of the parent company, had $60.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Corporate Debt Our current senior debt ratings are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service, B (watch neg) by Standard & Poors and BB by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS). The Companys long term deposit ratings are Ba2 by Moodys Investor Service, BB (watch neg) by Standard & Poors and BB (high) by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, is limited by regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2007, Converging Arrows had $60.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Converging Arrows is not restricted in its dealings with the parent company and may transfer funds to the parent company without regulatory approval. In addition to Converging Arrows, brokerage and banking subsidiaries may provide liquidity to the parent; however, they are restricted by regulatory guidelines. E*TRADE Bank is prohibited by regulations from lending to the parent company. At December 31, 2007, E*TRADE Bank had approximately $435.1 million of capital above the well capitalized level. In the current credit environment, we plan to increase the excess capital at E*TRADE Bank in order to increase our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining well capitalized status. Therefore, we do not expect to dividend this excess capital to the parent during the foreseeable future. E*TRADE Bank is also required by Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of tangible assets. E*TRADE Bank satisfied this requirement at December 31, 2007 and 2006. However, events beyond managements control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Banks ability to meet its future capital requirements. Brokerage subsidiaries are required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of our significant brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $730.8 million at December 31, 2007, of which $509.6 million is available for dividend while still maintaining a capital level above regulatory early warning guidelines. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm 48 Table of Contents commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Other Sources of Liquidity In addition to the liquidity available from subsidiaries, the parent company held $251.7 million in cash available as a resource. We also maintain $451.0 million in uncommitted financing to meet margin lending needs. There were no outstanding balances, and the full $451.0 million was available at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity for the Bank. At December 31, 2007, the Bank had approximately $10.5 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB. We have the option to make the interest payments of approximately $605 million on our springing lien notes in the form of either cash or additional springing lien notes through May 2010. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Certificates of deposit(1)(2) $ 4,159,985 $ 550,119 $ 222,867 $ 600,733 $ 5,533,704 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase(2) 7,528,168 332,424 186,862 1,330,275 9,377,729 Other borrowings(2)(3) 3,963,569 1,723,004 587,357 2,913,664 9,187,594 Corporate debt(4) 344,434 688,867 1,086,711 4,340,819 6,460,831 Operating lease payments(5) 38,767 70,248 46,103 67,686 222,804 Purchase Obligations(6) 72,125 19,687 2,913 94,725 FIN 48 liabilities 31,873 3,815 16,516 31,242 83,446 Total contractual obligations $ 16,138,921 $ 3,388,164 $ 2,149,329 $ 9,284,419 $ 30,960,833 (1) Does not include sweep deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts or checking accounts as there are no maturities and /or scheduled contractual payments.

(6) Includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by non cancelable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees. Excluded from the table are purchase obligations expected to be settled in cash within one year of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $6.3 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under home equity lines of credit and $0.5 billion of unused credit card and commercial lines. As of December 31, 2007, outstanding commitments to originate and sell loans totaled $0.4 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, while the Company had no commitments to purchase loans. The Company had a commitment to purchase and sell securities of $0.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The Company also had equity funding commitments of $25.6 million as of December 31, 2007, based on investment plans of venture capital funds, low income housing tax credit partnerships and joint ventures. Additional information related to commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23 Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters. 49 Table of Contents Other Liquidity Matters We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support regulatory capital needs at our Bank, reduce holding company debt, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. RISK MANAGEMENT As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. The identification and management of existing and potential risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management framework, principles and practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. Risks cannot be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Companys risk tolerance. We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Corporate Risk Committee, consisting of senior management executives, monitors the risk process and significant risks throughout the Company. In addition to this committee, various enterprise risk committees and departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and enterprise risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). The ALCO reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in a borrowers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms. Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where it results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks. Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committees duties include monitoring asset quality trends, evaluating market conditions including those in residential real estate markets, determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, establishing underwriting standards, approving large credit exposures, approving large portfolio purchases and delegating credit approval authority. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate. Conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets deteriorated sharply during 2007, particularly in the second half of 2007. The significant and abrupt evaporation of secondary market liquidity for various types of mortgage loans, particularly home equity loans, has decreased the overall availability of housing credit. As a result, many borrowers, particularly those in markets with declining housing prices, have been unable to refinance existing loans. This combination of a decline in the availability of credit and a decline in housing prices creates significant credit risk in our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio. 50 Table of Contents Underwriting Standards Originated Loans We originate loans that generally fall into two categories: Mortgage Loans Prime credit quality first lien mortgage loans secured by single family residences. Home Equity Loans Prime credit quality second lien mortgage loans, including home equity lines of credit, secured by single family residences. We originate loans primarily through our mortgage lending sales force. The loans are almost entirely secured by a primary residence for the purpose of purchase money, refinance, debt consolidation, or home equity loans. We originate both amortizing and interest only mortgage loans; however, we do not originate negative amortization or option ARMs. We price our loans based on the competitive environment as well as the risk elements inherent in the loan. We evaluate criteria such as, but not limited to: borrower credit score, loan to value ratio (LTV), documentation type, occupancy type and other risk elements. In the second half of 2007, we adjusted our loan origination practices and pricing to significantly curtail originations of higher risk loans, particularly home equity loans with FICO scores below 660 or a CLTV greater than 89%. In addition, during the second half of 2007, we exited our wholesale mortgage origination channel and no longer originate loans through brokers. Our underwriting guidelines were established with a focus on both the credit quality of the borrower as well as the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan. We have designed our underwriting guidelines so that our one to four family loans are salable in the secondary market. These guidelines include limitations on loan amount, loan to value ratio, debt to income ratio, documentation type and occupancy type. We also require borrowers to obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan to value first lien mortgage loans. The table below summarizes the underwriting guidelines for the major originated loan types that we offered as of December 31, 2007(1). However, one to four family loans originated and held on our balance sheet, rather than sold to third party investors, are typically held to more stringent underwriting criteria. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we retained approximately 10% of the total one to four family retail loans originated. All of our home equity loans originations were retained in 2007 and 2006.

(2) Conforming loans conform to the standards set forth by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The single family conforming loans limit was $417,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. (3) Non conforming loans (or jumbo loans) have a loan amount greater than the standard set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Underwriting decisions are made based on the overall credit characteristics of the loan, and are not automatically approved if the loan meets the individual criteria. Therefore, the average credit characteristics of the loans we originate are stronger than the minimum criteria summarized in the table above. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the average retail loan originated had a FICO of 750 and an average CLTV of 69%. We supplement our loan underwriting process with a post closing quality control process. Our quality control process consists of a re verification of loan documentation, an underwriting and appraisal review, and other underwriting guideline reviews. This combination of an underwriting process and a quality control process allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to the prescribed underwriting guidelines. 51 Table of Contents Underwriting Standards Purchased Loans Our underwriting policies for purchased loans focus primarily on ensuring (i) adherence to the underwriting policies of the originator of the loan and (ii) that the loans meet certain minimum credit criteria. In order to confirm adherence to the underwriting policies of the originator, we obtain a copy of the underwriting guidelines used to originate the loans prior to purchase. We perform an analysis on a sample of the loans to ensure compliance with these guidelines, with a focus on: appraisal methodology and type; equity methodology and calculation; debt to income methodology and calculation; credit characteristics, including documentation type and credit score; employment and income requirements; and the exception policy of the originator. To the extent loans do not adhere to the underwriting policies of the originator, they are excluded from the purchase. When purchasing a portfolio of loans, primarily in the first half of 2007, our strategy was to attempt to exclude loans that we believe have a higher risk of credit loss. We review a detailed listing of the credit characteristics of the portfolio prior to purchase and attempt to identify higher risk loans. Our review criteria are not static and vary by purchase, but typically focus on excluding loans in the following categories: FICO scores below 640; combined loan to value ratios above 100%; debt to income ratios above 50%; and investor property loans. Even though our strategy focuses on excluding loans with a lower credit quality, we invariably end up purchasing an insignificant amount of loans that do not meet the credit criteria. This typically occurs in a portfolio purchase where the seller of the loans requires the purchaser of the loans to buy all loans in the pool. In the second half of 2007, we altered our business strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. As a result, we do not anticipate purchasing a significant amount of loans in future periods. However, we have significantly tightened our underwriting policies for any future loan purchases that do occur. These criteria focus on limiting the acquisition of loans with a high risk of credit loss and require the exclusion of loans with the following attributes: second lien; home equity line of credit; combined loan to value ratio above 80%; FICO score below 700 at time of origination; and documentation type is not full documentation. Loan Portfolio We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors include, but are not limited to: borrowers debt to income ratio when loans are made, borrowers credit scores when loans are made, loan to value ratios, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type, and loan type. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, loan to value ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In a deteriorating housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the loan to value ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk. We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably end up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub prime loans. As of December 31, 2007, sub prime real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans. As noted above, we believe loan type, loan to value ratios and borrowers credit scores are key determinates of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans(1) on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a combined loan to value ratio (CLTV) of 90% or higher or a FICO score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios. (1) Approximately 14% of the home equity portfolio is in the first lien position. For home equity loans that are in a second lien position, we also hold the first lien position on the same residential real estate property for less than 1% of the loans in this portfolio. 52 Table of Contents The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV(1) and FICO score(2) of our two main loan portfolios, one to four family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity LTV/CLTV December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 &lt; 70% $ 6,666,212 $ 4,957,948 $ 3,628,619 $ 3,877,377 70% 80% 8,450,977 5,603,921 2,086,277 2,055,692 80% 90% 202,133 127,519 3,871,249 3,400,903 &gt;90% 187,207 180,826 2,315,179 2,475,036 Total $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 One to Four Family Home Equity FICO December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 &gt; 720 $ 10,373,807 $ 7,370,649 $ 6,992,793 $ 7,058,794 719 700 2,089,014 1,411,458 1,898,924 1,802,172 699 680 1,585,613 1,073,235 1,668,427 1,434,947 679 660 943,538 619,449 757,016 830,433 659 620 503,573 382,033 566,030 659,063 &lt;620 10,984 13,390 18,134 23,599 Total $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 The increases in one to four family loans with FICO scores above 680 were driven predominantly by the purchase of loans in those categories during the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity Acquisition Channel December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Purchased from a third party $ 12,904,759 $ 8,679,568 $ 10,638,021 $ 10,541,250 Originated by the Company 2,601,770 2,190,646 1,263,303 1,267,758 Total real estate loans $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 One to Four Family Home Equity Vintage Year December 31,2007 December 31,2006 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 2003 and prior $ 844,670 $ 1,044,221 $ 901,240 $ 1,176,320 2004 1,669,492 2,080,872 1,156,867 1,609,906 2005 3,084,336 3,657,194 2,790,423 3,582,871 2006 5,829,146 4,087,927 5,760,906 5,439,911 2007 4,078,885 1,291,888 Total real estate loans $ 15,506,529 $ 10,870,214 $ 11,901,324 $ 11,809,008 (1) LTV/CLTV data is based on LTV/CLTV ratios at the time of loan origination, and has not been updated to reflect changes in property values since that time.

The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2007 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity Consumer and Other Total Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1) December 31, 2007 $ 18,831 0.12 % $ 459,167 3.79 % $ 30,166 1.05 % $ 508,164 1.66 % December 31, 2006 $ 7,760 0.07 % $ 31,671 0.26 % $ 28,197 0.82 % $ 67,628 0.26 % (1) Allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the allowance for loan losses increased by $440.5 million from the level at December 31, 2006. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which deteriorated significantly during the second half of 2007. We believe this deterioration was caused by several factors, which are described below. First, the combined impact of rising mortgage interest rates and home price depreciation in key markets contributed to the declining performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Second, concerns that began in the sub prime mortgage loan market spread to the broader credit markets beginning in the second half of 2007, resulting in a significant deterioration in the overall credit markets. This deterioration led to a dramatic tightening of lending standards across the industry, and general liquidity pressure for many mortgage lenders, some of whom ultimately ceased operations as a result. The factors described above dramatically reduced the ability of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans, specifically their home equity loans, therefore drastically increasing the risk of loss once a loan becomes delinquent. During the second half of 2007, we also observed a decline in the percentage of delinquent loans that cure prior to charge off or foreclosure once they have become delinquent. We attribute this change in behavior to the factors described above, which have significantly limited borrowers alternatives to avoid defaulting on their loans. In addition, because of the likely decline in value of the homes collateralizing our home equity loans, our ability to recover our investment by foreclosing on the underlying properties has diminished as well. 54 Table of Contents The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge offs for the past five years (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Allowance for loan losses, beginning of period $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 $ 27,666 Provision for loan losses 640,078 44,970 54,016 38,121 38,523 Allowance acquired through acquisitions(1) 1,547 2,748 Charge offs: One to four family (5,661 ) (616 ) (936 ) (186 ) (364 ) Home equity (168,163 ) (15,372 ) (3,929 ) (1,464 ) (75 ) Recreational vehicle (32,566 ) (25,253 ) (20,592 ) (18,419 ) (20,341 ) Marine (8,766 ) (6,463 ) (8,009 ) (6,003 ) (7,369 ) Credit card (11,608 ) (11,371 ) (17,286 ) (10,313 ) (919 ) Other (915 ) (2,768 ) (6,095 ) (13,956 ) (24,666 ) Total charge offs (227,679 ) (61,843 ) (56,847 ) (50,341 ) (53,734 ) Recoveries: One to four family 476 167 234 223 Home equity 4,368 822 526 310 Recreational vehicle 15,771 11,959 7,848 9,088 9,738 Marine 4,591 4,091 3,960 3,225 3,806 Credit card 957 750 380 141 1 Other 1,974 3,426 5,488 7,743 8,876 Total recoveries 28,137 21,215 18,436 20,507 22,644 Net charge offs (199,542 ) (40,628 ) (38,411 ) (29,834 ) (31,090 ) Allowance for loan losses, end of period $ 508,164 $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 Net charge offs to average loans receivable outstanding 0.65 % 0.18 % 0.26 % 0.30 % 0.41 % (1) Acquisition of credit card portfolio in 2004 and 2003.

Our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For one to four family loans, a charge off is recognized when we foreclose on the property. For home equity loans, our policy is to charge off loans when we foreclose on the property or when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. For credit cards, our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 increased by $158.9 million. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge offs on home equity loans, which was driven mainly by the same factors as described above. The continued pressure in the residential real estate market, specifically home price depreciation combined with tighter mortgage lending guidelines, will likely lead to a higher level of charge offs in the future. The following graph illustrates the net charge offs by quarter: 56 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due.

Loans held for sale are accounted for at lower of cost or market value with adjustments recorded in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item and are not considered in the allowance for loan losses. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our nonperforming assets, net increased $376.7 million from $87.6 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one to four family loans of $147.7 million and home equity loans of $197.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 when compared to December 31, 2006. We expect nonperforming loan levels to increase over time due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets. 57 Table of Contents The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter: The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net increased from 91% at December 31, 2006 to 121% at December 31, 2007. This increase was driven primarily by the allowance for loan losses in our home equity loan portfolio. In addition to nonperforming assets in the table above, we monitor loans where a borrowers past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan (Special Mention loans). Special Mention loans represented $612.2 million, or 2%, and $259.0 million, or 1%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are generally secured by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss should they become nonperforming. These loans are actively monitored, continue to accrue interest and remain a component of the loans receivable balance. The increase in Special Mention loans was due primarily to an increase in the 30 day delinquency category of real estate loans. We expect migration from this category to more serious delinquency classifications to continue due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets. Loss Mitigation Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio. This group is focused on providing loan modification alternatives to borrowers who qualify through our servicers. These programs include forbearance arrangements, rate and term modifications, re aging programs and short sale options. During 2007, an insignificant number of borrowers have utilized these programs. We are also focused on managing the exposure of undrawn home equity lines of credit. These efforts include, but are not limited to: Restricting lines of credit from additional draws when a borrower fails to make a timely payment. The criteria applied vary by loan servicer, but they generally range between 15 days past due and 30 days past due. Additional line management strategies under development that would restrict additional draws on open lines of credit for nonperforming loans based on a change in the property value of the collateral securing the loan, or a significant change in the borrowers financial condition and ability to repay the loan. 58 Table of Contents In addition, we are reviewing our purchased home equity loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. More specifically, home equity loans that become 30 days delinquent are reviewed for early payment defaults, violations of transaction representations and warranties, or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. Historically, the majority of these repurchase requests were honored by the original seller; however, beginning in the third quarter of 2007 our repurchase rate declined substantially. Securities We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe asset backed securities represent our highest concentration of credit risk. The table below details the average credit ratings by type of asset as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2007 AA or Higher A BBB BelowInvestmentGrade Non Rated Total Mortgage backed securities $ 10,896,343 $ 469 $ $ $ $ 10,896,812 Asset backed securities 64 58 122 Corporate bonds, municipal bonds and preferred stock 1,271,105 8,342 1,279,447 Total $ 12,167,448 $ 8,811 $ $ 64 $ 58 $ 12,176,381 December 31, 2006 AA or Higher A BBB BelowInvestmentGrade Non Rated Total Mortgage backed securities $ 10,531,264 $ 3,771 $ 10,370 $ 4,800 $ 2,667 $ 10,552,872 Asset backed securities 948,309 780,639 452,992 22,966 34,159 2,239,065 Corporate bonds, municipal bonds and preferred stock 1,412,150 63,061 30,632 1,505,843 Total $ 12,891,723 $ 847,471 $ 493,994 $ 27,766 $ 36,826 $ 14,297,780 During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio in connection with the Citadel transaction on November 29, 2007. This sale was the primary reason for the decline in available for sale securities rated below AA. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal control process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from advertising to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof. The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial losses and reputation risks. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships. Third party vendor arrangements are overseen by the Vendor Risk Management group. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conduct financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers. Fraud losses result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and attempt to identify fraudulent transactions. However, new techniques are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. 59 Table of Contents Among other security measures, we offer customers token based security. The tokens display a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds. The number on the display and a password must be used together to access the customers account. This system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss or actual losses depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from inadequate staffing, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in opportunity or actual losses could include the failure of a competitor to meet its customers needs, Internet performance issues, legal, reputation, public policy and strategic risks. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. Allowances for Loan Losses Description The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2007, our allowance for loan losses was $508.2 million on $30.2 billion of loans designated as held for investment. In addition to our banking loans, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin receivables. Judgments The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge off and loss experience, current industry charge off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Effects if Actual Results Differ Although we have considerable experience in performing these reviews, if managements underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. If our estimates understate probable losses inherent in the portfolio, this would result in additional expense. A 10% increase or decrease in the allowances would result in a $50.8 million charge or credit to income, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments Description We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain on sales of loans and securities, net for our banking investments and gain on sales and impairment of investments for our brokerage (other than those held for market making purposes) and corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized $168.7 million, $2.8 million and $40.3 million, respectively, of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Judgments When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. For illiquid securities, fair value is estimated by obtaining market price quotes on similar liquid securities and adjusting the price to reflect differences. For securities where market quotes and similar securities are not available, we use discounted cash flows. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing losses based on market conditions and other factors. Other than temporary impairment is recorded based on management judgment. Management evaluates securities based on market conditions and all available information about the issuer or underlying collateral. This information is used to determine if impairment is other than temporary. The determination that impairment is other than temporary is judgmental. Based on the facts and circumstances, companies could have different conclusions regarding when securities are other than temporarily impaired. Impairment of mortgage backed or asset backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security meets both criterion, we write the security down to fair value in the current period. Similarly, preferred stock is considered to be impaired and written down to fair value in the current period when in a continued loss position for a prolonged period of time and that loss position is deemed to be significant by management. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. Effects if Actual Results Differ Earnings could be influenced by the timing of managements decisions to recognize a security as other than temporarily impaired. Our estimates are based on the best available information. Over time additional information may become available and may influence future write downs. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized book were written down, we would record a loss of $501.2 million. Management believes that its estimates of other than temporary impairment are supportable and reasonable. See Note 6 Available For Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding securities. Valuation and Accounting for Financial Derivatives Description The Banks principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are 61 Table of Contents customer deposits and other short term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long term and short term interest rates and to convert fixed rate assets or liabilities to variable rates. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. Substantially all derivatives held on December 31, 2007 were designated as hedges. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative assets of $133.1 million and derivative liabilities of $200.3 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had derivative assets of $208.1 million and derivative liabilities of $78.7 million. Judgments Hedge accounting is complex and involves the interpretation of a significant amount of accounting literature. From time to time, new interpretations are issued, which result in new accounting methods applied to existing and new transactions. The implementation of SFAS No. 133, as amended, involves numerous judgments and Company level interpretations. We must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. Judgment is necessary to determine the accounting for our hedging strategies. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. Revised accounting interpretations of existing literature could materially impact our financial results. If 10% of the fair value of derivatives classified in liabilities were determined to relate to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the adjustment would reduce income by $20.0 million before taxes. Similarly, if 10% of the fair value of derivatives included in assets were determined to not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the result would be $13.3 million in additional pre tax income. The most significant effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment is the earnings volatility that would be created by marking the derivatives to market as interest rates change. Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances Description In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2007 we had a net deferred tax asset of $550.2 million, net of a valuation allowance of $91.8 million. At December 31, 2006 we had a net deferred tax liability of $58.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $38.3 million. 62 Table of Contents Judgments Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations, resolution with taxing authorities of uncertain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Effects if Actual Results Differ These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Description We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2007 was $1.9 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2007 were $430.0 million, which have useful lives between three and thirty years. Judgments In connection with our annual impairment test of goodwill, the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007, was determined to be impaired. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives on intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If managements estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occurs, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized. Valuation and Expensing of Share Based Payments Description We value and expense employee share based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each periods compensation expense attributed to these options. 63 Table of Contents Judgments We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are managements best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of employees forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by approximately 7%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods.

The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest earning banking assets and the interest incurred on our interest bearing banking liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous years average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous years volume.

In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements. We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. In part, the FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances on the security of FHLB stock and various home mortgages and other assets principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2007, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $7.0 billion at interest rates ranging from 3.71% to 5.56% and at a weighted average rate of 4.80%. We also raise funds by selling securities to nationally recognized investment banking firms under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The investment banking firms hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed and variable rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Banks term investment option and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs.

Taxable equivalent interest adjustment The operating interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal and or state income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement of income (loss), as that is not permitted under GAAP. Tier 1 Capital Adjusted equity capital used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios at E*TRADE Bank as required by the OTS. Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholders equity at E*TRADE Bank, plus/(less) unrealized losses (gains) on available for sale securities and cash flow hedges, less deferred tax assets, goodwill and certain other intangible assets. 73 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest Rate Risk The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable rate and fixed rate assets and liabilities and we utilize derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense: Interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may re price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch. The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short and long term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income. Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize. Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2007, 92% of our total assets were enterprise interest earning assets. At December 31, 2007, approximately 67% of our total assets were residential real estate loans and available for sale mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment. When real estate loans prepay, unamortized premiums are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of unamortized premiums may result in lower than anticipated yields. E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on loan production volumes and prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy. Our liability structure consists of transactional deposit relationships, such as savings and money market accounts; certificates of deposit; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; customer payables; wholesale collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other entities; and long term notes. Our transactional deposit accounts and customer payables tend to be less rate sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities and money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and long term notes generally have fixed rates. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying 74 Table of Contents notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates.
