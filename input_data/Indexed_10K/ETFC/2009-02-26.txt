ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. GLOSSARY OF TERMS In analyzing and discussing our business, we utilize certain metrics, ratios and other terms that are defined in the Glossary of Terms, which is located at the end of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Strategy Our strategy is to profitably grow our retail customer franchise and mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet. We plan to grow our retail customer franchise by offering online brokerage and related products and services, including investor focused banking and asset gathering products and services. We believe we can accomplish this growth by appealing to retail investors, especially customers of traditional brokerages, who are attracted to our low cost, easy to use and innovative capabilities. Our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses. We believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength. We are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and or restructuring certain non core operations. We believe these changes will better align our business with the retail investor. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; the weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; the performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; and market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market, including securities sold and agreements to repurchase. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers; deepening customer acceptance of our products and services; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. 22 Table of Contents Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 Customer Activity Metrics(1): Retail customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 112.2 $ 185.0 $ 191.3 (39 )% Net new customer assets (dollars in billions)(2) $ 5.4 $ (11.3 ) $ 3.2 * Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions) $ 32.3 $ 32.7 $ 33.0 (1 )% Total daily average revenue trades 188,116 177,900 153,146 6 % Average commission per trade $ 10.88 $ 11.72 $ 11.97 (7 )% End of period total accounts 4,533,034 4,287,240 4,002,496 6 % Company Financial Metrics(1): Corporate cash (dollars in millions) $ 434.9 $ 312.4 $ 244.4 39 % E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital $ 714.7 $ 435.1 $ 134.2 64 % Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 1,080.6 $ 508.2 $ 67.6 113 % Allowance for loan losses as a % of nonperforming loans 114.70 % 121.44 % 90.52 % (6.74 )% Nonperforming loans as a % of gross loans receivable 3.69 % 1.37 % 0.28 % 2.32 % Enterprise net interest spread (basis points) 252 264 285 (5 )% Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 46.9 $ 56.1 $ 44.9 (16 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Metrics have been represented to exclude activity from discontinued operations. All discussions, unless otherwise noted, are based on metrics from continuing operations. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2008, net new customer assets were $6.4 billion excluding the sale of Retirement Advisors of America (RAA). Customer Activity Metrics Changes in retail customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in retail customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities, which declined substantially in 2008. Net new customer assets are total inflows to all new and existing customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing customer accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new customers. Customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. DARTs are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. As a result, this metric is impacted by both the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders, mass affluent and main street customers. End of period total accounts is an indicator of the Companys ability to attract and retain customers. Company Financial Metrics Corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company. It is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital is the excess capital that E*TRADE Bank has compared to the regulatory minimum well capitalized threshold and is an indicator of E*TRADE Banks ability to absorb future loan losses. 23 Table of Contents Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to the expected charge offs in our loan portfolio over the next twelve months. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is a general indicator of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. Changes in this ratio are also driven by changes in the mix of our loan portfolio. Nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable is an indicator of the performance of our total loan portfolio. Enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Enterprise interest earning assets, in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread, are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Significant Events in 2008 Strengthening Our Core Asset the Retail Customer One of our key strategic objectives for 2008 was to strengthen our retail customer base and ensure the credit issues in our balance sheet did not negatively impact our customer base. We believe we have made significant progress in this area throughout 2008. Highlights of our progress during the year ended December 31, 2008 are as follows: Opened 1,032,000 gross new accounts and produced 246,000 net new accounts; Net new customer asset flows of $5.4 billion ($6.4 billion excluding the sale of RAA); Customer cash and deposit balances decreased slightly to $32.3 billion; and Total DARTs of 188,000, up 6% from the prior year. Execution of Our Capital Plan E*TRADE Bank had excess risk based capital (excess to the regulatory minimum well capitalized threshold) of $714.7 million, including $650 million of capital contributed by the parent company, E*TRADE Financial Corporation; We had corporate cash of $434.9 million; and We completed four key non core asset sales resulting in net proceeds of approximately $750 million: the corporate aircraft related assets; RAA; the Canadian brokerage business; and our equity shares in Investsmart(1). Exit of the Direct Retail Lending Business We announced the exit of our direct retail lending business, which was our last remaining loan origination channel (we exited our wholesale mortgage lending channel in 2007). Therefore, the results of operations of the entire direct retail lending business are reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. In future periods, we plan to partner with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. Retirement of Corporate Debt In November 2008, we retired the entire balance of our $450 million 6.125% subordinated notes due 2019. The notes were part of the mandatory convertible debt securities issued in 2005 and were retired in connection (1) The equity shares of Investsmart were sold by our wholly owned subsidiary, E*TRADE Mauritius. 24 Table of Contents with the issuance of 25 million shares of our common stock at $18 per share. Additionally, we exchanged $120.8 million in principal of our senior notes through debt for equity exchanges. Completion of Citadel Investment In January 2008, the Company issued an additional $150.0 million of springing lien notes in accordance with the terms of the agreement with Citadel. This was the final note issuance under the agreement with Citadel and brought the total springing lien notes outstanding to $1.9 billion in principal(1). In connection with this issuance, the Company received $150.0 million in cash. Additionally, the Company issued to Citadel the remaining 46.7 million shares of common stock that had been required to be issued under the agreement. Enhancements to our Retail Investor Focused Products and Services We introduced E*TRADE Mobile Pro, which offers wireless customers access to their E*TRADE accounts. Mobile Pro offers BlackBerry&reg; smartphone users real time streaming stock and options quotes, the ability to trade equities and options and brokerage and bank account cash transfers, among other features. We began offering expanded tools and services, including improved charting capabilities and redesigned our Global Markets, US Markets, and Market News pages. We also began offering customization, expanded our mutual fund center with research capabilities and improved charting and analytics for Power E*TRADE Pro. We launched Retirement QuickPlan, which provides a quick assessment of an individuals or familys retirement savings and investing plan as well as guidelines to get on track with personal retirement goals. Ranked #1 Online Broker by SmartMoney Magazine For the second year in a row, SmartmoneyTM ranked the Company as the #1 Online Discount Broker. The Company earned five out of five stars in the Research, Trading Tools, Banking Service and Mutual Funds and Investment Products categories. Significant Events in 2007 Citadel Investment of $2.5 Billion Including Sale of Asset Backed Securities Portfolio The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base. As a result, we believe it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash, which would in turn stabilize our balance sheet and our customer base. On November 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio, 84.7 million shares of common stock (2) in the Company and approximately $1.8 billion in 12 1/2% springing lien notes(3). We believe this transaction provided timely stability for our business and helped alleviate customer concerns. (1) The $1.9 billion in principal does not include the $121.0 million of capitalized interest in November 2008, which resulted in $2.1 billion in principal of springing lien notes outstanding to Citadel as of December 31, 2008. (2) The 84.7 million shares of common stock were issued in increments: 14.8 million upon initial closing in November 2007; 23.2 million upon Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act approval in December 2007; and 46.7 million shares are expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2008 as the Company has received all necessary regulatory approvals. (3) Included in the $1.8 billion issuance is $186 million of 12 1/2% springing lien notes in exchange for $186 million of the Companys senior notes that were owned by Citadel. The $1.8 billion in 12 1 /2% springing lien notes includes $100 million in notes issued to BlackRock in connection with the transaction. The $1.8 billion in 12 1/2% springing lien notes represents the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and does not include the additional $150 million of springing lien notes issued in January 2008 in accordance with the terms of the agreement with Citadel. 25 Table of Contents Launch of Global Trading Platform We launched our Global Trading Platform, which provides the ability to buy, sell and hold foreign equities in local currencies to investors who seek liquidity and diversity in their portfolios. Our U.S. customers now have access to foreign stocks and currencies in six major international markets: Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom. Introduction of the Max Rate Checking Account E*TRADE Bank introduced a Max Rate Checking Account which features an annual percentage yield up to 3.25%, unlimited check writing and free online bill pay, among other benefits. Ranked #1 Premium Broker by SmartMoney Magazine SmartMoney Magazine recognized the Company as the #1 premium broker in its 2007 broker survey. SmartMoney noted the Company for its improved service, new global trading capabilities, intuitive trade tools and easy search capabilities and numerous banking products. Summary Financial Results Income Statement Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Net operating interest income $ 1,268.0 $ 1,583.6 (20 )% Total net revenue $ 1,925.6 $ 161.7 * Provision for loan losses $ 1,583.7 $ 640.1 147 % Commission revenue $ 515.6 $ 663.6 (22 )% Fees and service charges revenue $ 200.0 $ 230.6 (13 )% Operating margin $ (948.3 ) $ (2,052.2 ) (54 )% Net loss from continuing operations $ (809.4 ) $ (1,442.3 ) (44 )% Net loss $ (511.8 ) $ (1,441.8 ) (65 )% Diluted net loss per share from continuing operations $ (1.58 ) $ (3.40 ) (54 )% Diluted net loss per share $ (1.00 ) $ (3.40 ) (71 )% * Percentage not meaningful. The continued deterioration in the residential real estate and credit markets, as well as the nearly unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets, had a significant impact on our financial performance during 2008. The losses in our institutional segment caused by this deterioration more than offset the strong underlying performance of our retail segment, resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of $809.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our retail customer base showed positive growth trends during the year, including the addition of approximately 246,000 net new accounts and net inflows of customer assets of approximately $5.4 billion. We believe these are indications that our retail segment has not only stabilized, but has returned to modest growth. 26 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions) December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Total assets $ 48.5 $ 56.8 (15 )% Total enterprise interest earning assets $ 45.0 $ 52.3 (14 )% Loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets 63 % 71 % (8 )% Retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities 70 % 61 % 9 % The decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of $5.7 billion in loans, net and a decrease of $4.4 billion in margin receivables. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations of $2.9 billion. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. During this period, we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we increased our excess risk based capital at E*TRADE Bank by 64% to $714.7 million compared to prior year. In connection with this strategy and the Citadel Investment, we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through January 1, 2010. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2008 Compared to 2007 We had a net loss from continuing operations of $809.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to an increase in our provision for loan losses of $943.6 million to $1.6 billion. In addition, we incurred losses of $153.8 million, net of hedges, on our preferred stock in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) during the period ended December 31, 2008. The losses in our institutional segment, which included both of these items, more than offset our retail segment income, which was $608.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, we made the decision to sell our Canadian brokerage business and we decided to close our direct retail lending business. As a result, the financial results for both the Canadian brokerage business and the direct retail lending business have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, we re defined Total net revenue by removing Provision for loan losses and separately stating it as its own line item and reclassified hedge ineffectiveness recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), from Other operating expense to the Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item. We report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of the performance in our banking and balance sheet management businesses. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and past acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Similarly, we report gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and 27 Table of Contents securities, net is the result of activities in our operations, namely our balance sheet management business, including impairment on our available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Revenue: Operating interest income $ 2,469,940 $ 3,523,055 $ (1,053,115 ) (30 )% Operating interest expense (1,201,934 ) (1,939,456 ) 737,522 (38 )% Net operating interest income 1,268,006 1,583,599 (315,593 ) (20 )% Commission 515,551 663,642 (148,091 ) (22 )% Fees and service charges 199,956 230,567 (30,611 ) (13 )% Principal transactions 84,882 102,180 (17,298 ) (17 )% Loss on loans and securities, net (195,483 ) (2,465,474 ) 2,269,991 (92 )% Other revenue 52,684 47,212 5,472 12 % Total non interest income (expense) 657,590 (1,421,873 ) 2,079,463 * Total net revenue $ 1,925,596 $ 161,726 $ 1,763,870 * * Percentage not meaningful Total net revenue increased to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase was primarily due to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 20% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which include margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to the planned decline in enterprise interest earning assets during 2008. 28 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

(4) Non operating interest earning assets consist of property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets that do not generate operating interest income. Some of these assets generate corporate interest income. (5) Non operating interest bearing liabilities consist of corporate debt, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities that do not generate operating interest expense. Some of these liabilities generate corporate interest expense. (6) Enterprise net interest income is taxable equivalent basis net operating interest income excluding corporate interest income and corporate interest expense, stock conduit interest income and expense and interest earned on customer cash held by third parties. Management believes this non GAAP measure is useful to analysts and investors as it is a measure of the net operating interest income generated by our operations. (7) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.2 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE Financial, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. Other consists of net operating interest earned on average stock conduit assets of $1.3 million and $303.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were not any stock conduit assets at December 31, 2008. 29 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.52 % 2.64 % 2.85 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.66 % 2.81 % 3.03 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 105.40 % 105.10 % 105.94 % Return on average: Total assets (0.99 )% (2.34 )% 1.26 % Total shareholders equity (18.98 )% (34.86 )% 16.56 % Average equity to average total assets 5.20 % 6.73 % 7.61 % Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 16% to $46.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily the result of a decrease in our available for sale portfolio, margin receivables and loans, net, offset by an increase in cash and equivalents. Average available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities decreased 41% to $9.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of certain mortgage backed securities in the first quarter of 2008 and the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Average margin receivables decreased 17% to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. We believe this decrease was due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure given the substantial volatility in the financial markets. Average loans, net decreased 10% to $27.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of our focus on growing the one to four family loan portfolio in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 17% to $44.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in repurchase agreements and other borrowings, FHLB advances and customer payables. Average repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased 37% to $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Average FHLB advances decreased 34% to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Repurchase agreements and other borrowings are the primary wholesale funding sources for our loans, net and available for sale securities portfolios. The decreases in these balances were the result of paying down these liabilities as we decreased the size of our balance sheet during 2008. Average customer payables decreased 25% to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was related primarily to the sale of our Canadian brokerage business during the third quarter of 2008. Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 12 basis points to 2.52% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was driven in part by an atypical spread among two key benchmark interest rates: federal funds and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The majority of our interest earning assets and liabilities are linked, either directly or indirectly, to these benchmark interest rates. We believe this spread will return to more normalized levels in future periods. In addition, we plan to reduce the rates paid on our Complete Savings Account to be more consistent with current market rates. We believe the combined impact of these two items will result in a modest increase to our net interest spread in future periods. 30 Table of Contents Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Operating interest income: Operating interest income, gross $ 2,443,886 $ 3,509,453 $ (1,065,567 ) (30 )% Hedge income 26,054 13,602 12,452 92 % Operating interest income 2,469,940 3,523,055 (1,053,115 ) (30 )% Operating interest expense: Operating interest expense, gross (1,127,026 ) (1,936,256 ) 809,230 (42 )% Hedge expense (74,908 ) (3,200 ) (71,708 ) * Operating interest expense (1,201,934 ) (1,939,456 ) 737,522 (38 )% Net operating interest income $ 1,268,006 $ 1,583,599 $ (315,593 ) (20 )% * Percentage not meaningful Commission Commission revenue decreased 22% to $515.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was due almost entirely to a decrease of $142.6 million, or 99%, in our institutional commission revenue as a result of the exit of our institutional brokerage operations. Commission revenue from our retail segment, which is the sole source of commission revenue in future periods, remained stable for the year ended December 31, 2008 declining by only 1% compared to 2007. The primary factors that affect our retail commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, exchange traded funds, contract for difference and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. DARTs increased 6% to 188,116 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Our U.S. DART volume increased 5% and our international DARTs grew by 9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option related DARTs as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs represented 15% and 16% of U.S. trading volume for the periods ending December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Average commission per trade decreased 7% to $10.88 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily a function of the product and customer mix. The overall poor performance of the equity markets for the year ended December 31, 2008 disproportionately impacted higher commission products, such as corporate services transactions and mutual funds. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent customers, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation, win back and other promotional campaigns also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 13% to $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a lower order flow revenue, advisory management fees and CDO 31 Table of Contents management fees. The decrease in advisory management fees was primarily due to our sale of RAA. The decrease in CDO management fees was due to the sale of our collateral management agreements during the first quarter of 2008. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 17% to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. Loss on Loans and Securities, Net Loss on loans and securities, net was $195.5 million and $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Loss on sales of loans, net $ (783 ) $ (14,343 ) $ 13,560 (95 )% Gain (loss) on securities and other investments 40,289 (2,911 ) 43,200 * Loss on asset backed securities sale to Citadel (2,241,031 ) 2,241,031 * Loss on impairment (102,909 ) (168,739 ) 65,830 (39 )% Loss on trading securities, net (134,297 ) (33,441 ) (100,856 ) 302 % Hedge ineffectiveness 2,217 (5,009 ) 7,226 * Loss on securities, net (194,700 ) (2,451,131 ) 2,256,431 (92 )% Loss on loans and securities, net $ (195,483 ) $ (2,465,474 ) $ 2,269,991 (92 )% * Percentage not meaningful The loss on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to losses on our preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which experienced record price declines and volatility during the third quarter of 2008. Based upon our concerns about continuing market instability, all of our positions were liquidated during the third quarter of 2008, resulting in a pre tax loss of $153.8 million, net of hedges, that was recognized in loss on trading securities, net. We recognized $95.0 million of impairment on certain securities in our CMO portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods. In addition, we recognized $7.7 million of impairment related to the funds held in the Reserve Funds Primary Fund. For additional information about the Primary Fund, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources on page 48. The loss on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 12% to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in other revenue was due to income from the cash surrender value of Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI), which was entered into during the third quarter of 2007. 32 Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio, which began in the second half of 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one to four family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008. Operating Expense The components of operating expense and the year over year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 383,385 $ 434,785 $ (51,400 ) (12 )% Clearing and servicing 185,082 270,199 (85,117 ) (32 )% Advertising and market development 175,250 138,675 36,575 26 % Communications 96,792 98,347 (1,555 ) (2 )% Professional services 94,070 99,193 (5,123 ) (5 )% Occupancy and equipment 85,766 85,189 577 1 % Depreciation and amortization 82,483 83,198 (715 ) (1 )% Amortization of other intangibles 35,746 40,472 (4,726 ) (12 )% Impairment of goodwill 101,208 (101,208 ) * Facility restructuring and other exit activities 29,502 27,183 2,319 9 % Other 122,139 195,384 (73,245 ) (37 )% Total operating expense $ 1,290,215 $ 1,573,833 $ (283,618 ) (18 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Operating expense decreased 18% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by decreases in compensation and benefits, clearing and servicing, impairment of goodwill and other expense. These decreases were offset slightly by an increase in advertising and market development expense. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 12% to $383.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base and decreased variable compensation during the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to 2007. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense decreased 32% to $185.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease is related primarily to the exit of our institutional brokerage operations, which resulted in lower clearing expenses. 33 Table of Contents Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 26% to $175.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This planned increase was aimed at restoring customer confidence as well as expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. Impairment of Goodwill Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007. There was no such impairment for the year ended December 31, 2008. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These costs were due primarily to the exit of certain facilities during the year ended December 31, 2008. Slightly offsetting the restructuring expense is the gain on the sale of RAA of $2.8 million which was recorded in the second quarter of 2008. Other Other expense decreased 37% to $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was primarily due to items that are not expected to recur in future periods. During the first quarter of 2008, we sold our corporate aircraft related assets, which resulted in a $23.7 million gain on sale. During the second quarter of 2008, we realized approximately $13 million of insurance recoveries of fraud losses incurred in prior periods as well as other recoveries to legal reserves. The decrease is also due to $35.1 million in expense recorded for certain legal and regulatory matters for the year ended December 31, 2007. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased to an expense of $330.6 million for 2008 compared to an expense of $123.1 million for 2007, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Other income (expense): Corporate interest income $ 7,210 $ 5,755 $ 1,455 25 % Corporate interest expense (362,160 ) (172,482 ) (189,678 ) 110 % Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net (4,230 ) 35,980 (40,210 ) (112 )% Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt 10,084 (19 ) 10,103 * Equity in income of investments and venture funds 18,462 7,665 10,797 141 % Total other income (expense) $ (330,634 ) $ (123,101 ) $ (207,533 ) 169 % * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted primarily of corporate interest expense resulting from our corporate debt, which included the springing lien notes, senior notes and mandatory convertible notes. Corporate interest expense increased 110% to $362.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the interest expense on the springing lien notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008. During 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary, E*TRADE Mauritius, sold its equity shares in Investsmart for proceeds of approximately $145 million, which 34 Table of Contents resulted in a gain on sale of $22.3 million recorded in equity in income of investments and venture funds. During 2007, we sold our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. The gain on early extinguishment of debt is primarily due to a gain of $21.5 million recognized on the exchange of our senior notes for shares of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2008. The gain of $21.5 million is offset by a loss of $10.8 million related to the early extinguishment of FHLB advances and a loss of $0.6 million on the prepayment of debt related to the sale of the corporate aircraft. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $469.5 million and $732.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was (36.7)% compared to (33.7)% for 2007. For additional information, see Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. Our 2008 effective tax rate included a number of tax benefits and expenses which were incremental to the amount of tax accrued based on the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The most significant items are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions): Year EndedDecember 31, 2008Tax Expense Incremental tax benefits Tax exempt income $ 10.2 FIN 48 settlements and reversals 14.0 Low income housing tax credits 2.4 Total tax benefits 26.6 Incremental tax expenses Non deductible officers compensation 1.6 Sweden valuation allowance 7.3 Removal of foreign earnings from permanently reinvested 1.8 Tax rate differential of international operations 7.9 Non deductible portion of interest expense on springing lien notes 24.6 Total tax expense 43.2 Incremental tax expense $ 16.6 The Company expects the 2009 effective tax rate to increase when compared to the tax rates for 2008. More specifically, we expect the 2009 effective tax rate to be based on a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 37 38% plus an additional fixed amount of income tax expense between $25 and $30 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required, the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. As of December 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We 35 Table of Contents reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our retail and institutional segments separately and determined that our net operating losses in 2007 and 2008 were due solely to the credit losses in our institutional segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased the business activities which we believe are the root cause of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in 2007 and 2008. Our retail segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2008, which is considered significant, objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believe we are able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in our results of operations. This volatility is isolated almost entirely to our institutional segment. Our forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding our estimate of future expected credit losses, which we believe to be the most variable component of our forecasts of future taxable income. We believe this variability could create a book loss in our overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting our overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which we expect to realize our deferred tax assets. Conversely, we believe our retail segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which we believe we can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which we estimate we will realize our deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company. We will continue to monitor and update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need for a valuation allowance. 36 Table of Contents Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold our Canadian brokerage business to Scotiabank. The sale resulted in proceeds of approximately $515 million, including $54 million in repatriation of capital prior to the close and a pre tax gain of $429.0 million. We also exited our direct retail lending business, which was our last remaining loan origination channel (we exited our wholesale mortgage lending channel in 2007). Therefore, the results of operations of our Canadian brokerage business, including the gain on sale, and the entire direct retail lending business are reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. The following table outlines the components of discontinued operations (dollars of thousands): Years EndedDecember 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Lending loss, net of tax $ (6,235 ) $ (21,612 ) $ 15,377 (71 )% Canada income, net of tax 10,910 22,195 (11,285 ) (51 )% Canada gain on disposal, net of tax 268,798 268,798 * Canada tax benefit of excess tax basis over book basis 24,121 24,121 * Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 297,594 $ 583 $ 297,011 * * Percentage not meaningful. The benefit of excess tax basis over book basis is related to our Canadian brokerage business, which resulted from the difference between the tax and financial reporting bases of the business. We recognized this difference in the second quarter of 2008 because a commitment to sell the Canadian brokerage business was in place. The sale of the Canadian brokerage business was completed in the third quarter of 2008 for a gain of $268.8 million, net of tax. 2007 Compared to 2006 Income (loss) from continuing operations was a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to income of $626.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. These losses in our institutional segment more than offset the increase in our retail segment income, which increased $91.3 million to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Revenue Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income increased 14% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in enterprise interest earning assets. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 25% to $56.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Average loans, net grew 39% to $30.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of our focus on growing the one to four family loan portfolio in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 26% to $53.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily in retail deposits. Average retail deposits increased 30% to $26.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Increases in average retail deposits were driven by growth in the Complete Savings Account. 37 Table of Contents Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 21 basis points to 2.64% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of a challenging interest rate environment throughout 2007 as well as growth in our Complete Savings Account, which pays a higher interest rate than the majority of our other deposit products. Commission Commission revenue increased 11% to $663.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, which was driven by an increase of $61.8 million, or 13%, in our retail commission revenue. DARTs increased 16% to 177,900 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Our U.S. DART volume increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Our international DARTs grew by 42% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of total U.S. DARTs and represented 16% of trading volume versus 13% in 2006. Average commission per trade decreased 2% to $11.72 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation and win back campaigns, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges increased 5% to $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was due to an increase in order flow payment, advisor management fees, foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees and mortgage servicing fees. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 7% to $102.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes. Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net was a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a gain of $21.2 million for the same period in 2006. The decline in the total gain (loss) on loans and securities, net during 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 36% to $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in other revenue was due to income from the cash surrender value of BOLI, an increase in fees earned in connection with distribution of shares during initial public offerings and software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio in the second half of 2007. 38 Table of Contents Operating Expense Operating expense increased 19% to $1.6 billion for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by increases in clearing and servicing, advertising and market development, impairment of goodwill and other expense. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 1% to $434.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The slight increase resulted primarily from increased benefit costs offset slightly by lower incentive based compensation in the current year. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 11% to $270.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase is due primarily to higher loan balances during the period, which resulted in higher servicing costs, and increased trading activity, which resulted in higher clearing expenses. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 31% to $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This planned increase is a result of expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. Impairment of Goodwill Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of this expense was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and was driven primarily by the shut down of the international portion of our institutional brokerage business. Other Other expense increased 51% to $195.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 is due primarily to higher expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and higher FDIC premiums. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased 71% to $123.1 million for 2007 compared to 2006. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of corporate interest expense which increased 13% to $172.5 million, compared to 2006. The interest expense was partially offset by the sale of our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in Softbank Investment Corporation and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $732.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to an income tax expense of $305.4 million for the same period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for 39 Table of Contents 2007 was (33.7)% compared to 32.8% for 2006. For additional information, see Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. Discontinued Operations Our income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2006. During 2007 and 2006, discontinued operations included operating results from our Canadian brokerage business and our direct retail lending business. During 2006, discontinued operations also included the results from our professional agency business, E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC. SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW Retail The following table summarizes retail financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 2006 Amount % Retail segment income: Net operating interest income $ 829,707 $ 962,557 $ 870,462 $ (132,850 ) (14 )% Commission 514,736 520,216 458,463 (5,480 ) (1 )% Fees and service charges 200,726 218,682 202,037 (17,956 ) (8 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (78 ) 180 3,414 (258 ) * Other revenue 38,463 40,653 35,357 (2,190 ) (5 )% Net segment revenue 1,583,554 1,742,288 1,569,733 (158,734 ) (9 )% Total segment expense 975,488 947,864 866,568 27,624 3 % Total retail segment income $ 608,066 $ 794,424 $ 703,165 $ (186,358 ) (23 )% Key Metrics(1): Retail customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 112.2 $ 185.0 $ 191.3 $ (72.8 ) (39 )% Net new customer assets (dollars in billions)(2) $ 5.4 $ (11.3 ) $ 3.2 $ 16.7 * Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions) $ 32.3 $ 32.7 $ 33.0 $ (0.4 ) (1 )% DARTs 188,116 177,900 153,146 10,216 6 % Average commission per trade $ 10.88 $ 11.72 $ 11.97 $ (0.84 ) (7 )% End of period margin debt (dollars in billions) $ 2.8 $ 7.0 $ 6.8 $ (4.2 ) (60 )% End of period total accounts 4,533,034 4,287,240 4,002,496 245,794 6 % * Percentage not meaningful.

(2) For the year ended December 31, 2008, net new customer assets were $6.4 billion excluding the sale of RAA. Our retail segment generates revenue from brokerage and banking relationships with retail customers. These relationships essentially drive five sources of revenue: net operating interest income; commission; fees and service charges; gain (loss) on loans and securities, net; and other revenue. Other revenue includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we ultimately service retail customers through these corporate relationships. 2008 Compared to 2007 During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base which caused a decline in the core drivers of our retail segment, including: net new accounts, customer cash and deposits, DARTs, 40 Table of Contents margin debt and retail customer assets. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we anticipate credit related losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized. During the year ended December 31, 2008, our retail customer base showed positive growth trends, including adding almost 246,000 net new accounts and growth in net new customer assets of approximately $5.4 billion ($6.4 billion excluding the sale of RAA). We believe these are indications that our retail segment has not only stabilized but has returned to modest growth. Retail segment income decreased 23% to $608.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This was due primarily to a decrease in net operating interest income and an increase in total segment expense. Retail net operating interest income decreased 14% to $829.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in margin debt as well as the above market rate on our Complete Savings Account. We plan to reduce the rate on this product in future periods which we believe will result in an improvement to retail net operating interest income. Retail commission revenue decreased 1% to $514.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The slight decrease in commission revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in average commission per trade of 7%, offset by an increase in DARTs of 6%. Retail segment expense increased 3% to $975.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase related primarily to our planned growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 2.6 million active brokerage accounts, 1.0 million active stock plan accounts and 0.9 million active banking accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, our retail brokerage products contributed 67% for both years, and our banking products contributed 28% and 27%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 Retail segment income increased 13% to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in retail segment income during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 was due to an increase in net operating interest income and commission revenue, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Retail net operating interest income increased 11% to $962.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by customer cash and deposits, which generally translate into a lower cost of funds. The growth in customer cash and deposits during the first three quarters of 2007 was largely offset by the decline in customer cash during the fourth quarter of 2007. Retail commission revenue increased 13% to $520.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in commission revenue was primarily the result of increased trading volumes in the overall domestic equity market and in our international commissions. Retail segment expense increased 9% to $947.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related to our targeted growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 2.5 million active brokerage accounts, 1.1 million active stock plan accounts and 0.8 million active banking accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, our retail brokerage products contributed 67% and 69%, respectively, and our banking products contributed 27% and 25%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. 41 Table of Contents Institutional The following table summarizes institutional financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 2006 Amount % Institutional segment income (loss): Net operating interest income $ 438,299 $ 621,042 $ 515,053 $ (182,743 ) (29 )% Commission 815 143,426 138,613 (142,611 ) (99 )% Fees and service charges 8,422 21,619 25,366 (13,197 ) (61 )% Principal transactions 84,882 102,180 110,136 (17,298 ) (17 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (195,405 ) (2,465,654 ) 17,786 2,270,249 (92 )% Other revenue 14,271 7,093 244 7,178 101 % Net segment revenue 351,284 (1,570,294 ) 807,198 1,921,578 * Provision for loan losses 1,583,666 640,078 44,970 943,588 147 % Total segment expense 323,969 636,237 461,078 (312,268 ) (49 )% Total institutional segment income (loss) $ (1,556,351 ) $ (2,846,609 ) $ 301,150 $ 1,290,258 (45 )% Key Metrics(1): Nonperforming loans as a % of gross loans receivable 3.69 % 1.37 % 0.28 % 2.32 % Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 1,080.6 $ 508.2 $ 67.6 $ 572.4 113 % Allowance for loan losses as a % of nonperforming loans 114.70 % 121.44 % 90.52 % (6.74 )% * Percentage not meaningful (1) Metrics have been represented to exclude activity from discontinued operations. All discussions, unless otherwise noted, are based on metrics from continuing operations. Our institutional segment generates revenue from balance sheet management activities and market making activities. Balance sheet management activities include managing loans previously purchased from the retail segment as well as third parties, and leveraging these loans and retail customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income. 2008 Compared to 2007 As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our institutional segment incurred a loss of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The loss was driven primarily by an increase in our provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Net operating interest income decreased 29% to $438.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to the decrease in average enterprise interest earning assets of 16% to $46.9 billion as of December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Institutional commission revenue decreased to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was a result of the exit of our institutional brokerage operations. Fees and service charges revenue decreased 61% to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in CDO management fees, which are no longer a revenue stream due to the sale of our collateral management agreements during the first quarter of 2008. 42 Table of Contents The total loss on loans and securities, net during year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to losses on our preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which experienced record price declines and volatility during the third quarter of 2008. Based upon our concerns about continuing market instability, all of our positions were liquidated during the third quarter of 2008, resulting in a pre tax loss of $153.8 million, net of hedges, that was recognized in loss on trading securities, net. In addition, we recognized $95.0 million of impairment on certain securities in our CMO portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods. Provision for loan losses increased $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio, which began in the second half of 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one to four family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008. Total institutional segment expense decreased 49% to $324.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was due primarily to the goodwill impairment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with our balance sheet management business. There was also a decline in our clearing expense related to the exit of our institutional brokerage operations, as well as a reduction in corporate overhead expenses, the majority of which are allocated to the institutional segment. 2007 Compared to 2006 As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our institutional segment incurred a loss of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The loss was driven primarily by losses in our asset backed securities portfolio of approximately $2.5 billion as well as provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net operating interest income increased 21% to $621.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in average interest earning assets of 25% to $56.1 as of December 31, 2007. Institutional commission revenue increased 3% to $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due to higher trading volumes as a result of volatility in global equity markets. Fees and service charges revenue decreased 15% to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is related to a $4.5 million decline in service fee income as a result of lower rates and lower home equity, credit card and CDO management fees. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was largely due to the deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio. 43 Table of Contents Total institutional segment expense increased 38% to $636.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 and was due primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with the decline in fair value of our balance sheet management business during the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase was also driven by the expenses associated with certain legal and regulatory matters. BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Assets: Cash(1) $ 4,995,447 $ 2,113,075 $ 2,882,372 136 % Trading securities 55,481 130,018 (74,537 ) (57 )% Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 10,806,094 11,255,048 (448,954 ) (4 )% Margin receivables 2,791,168 7,179,175 (4,388,007 ) (61 )% Loans, net 24,451,852 30,139,382 (5,687,530 ) (19 )% Investment in FHLB stock 200,892 338,585 (137,693 ) (41 )% Other assets(2) 5,237,281 5,690,654 (453,373 ) (8 )% Total assets $ 48,538,215 $ 56,845,937 $ (8,307,722 ) (15 )% Liabilities and shareholders equity: Deposits $ 26,136,246 $ 25,884,755 $ 251,491 1 % Wholesale borrowings(3) 11,735,056 16,379,197 (4,644,141 ) (28 )% Customer payables 3,753,332 5,514,675 (1,761,343 ) (32 )% Corporate debt 2,750,532 3,022,698 (272,166 ) (9 )% Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities 1,571,553 3,215,547 (1,643,994 ) (51 )% Total liabilities 45,946,719 54,016,872 (8,070,153 ) (15 )% Shareholders equity 2,591,496 2,829,065 (237,569 ) (8 )% Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 48,538,215 $ 56,845,937 $ (8,307,722 ) (15 )% (1) Includes balance sheet line items cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations. (2) Includes balance sheet line items property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets. (3) Includes balance sheet line items securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. The decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of $5.7 billion in loans, net and a decrease of $4.4 billion in margin receivables for the period ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash of $2.9 billion. The decrease in loans, net is due to our strategy of reducing balance sheet risk and halting our previous focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. During this period, we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on strengthening our capital position. We believe the decrease in our margin receivables is due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure due to the volatility in the financial markets and is not due to a specific issue with the terms or competitiveness of our margin product. The decrease in total liabilities was attributable primarily to a decrease of $4.6 billion in wholesale borrowings, a decrease in customer payables of $1.8 billion and a decrease of $1.6 billion in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities for the period ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Repurchase agreements 44 Table of Contents and other borrowings are the primary wholesale funding sources for our loans, net and available for sale securities portfolios. The decreases in these balances were the result of paying down these liabilities as we decreased the size of our balance sheet during 2008. The decrease in our customer payables is related primarily to the sale of our Canadian brokerage business during the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, stock loan, which is reported within the accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities line item, decreased $1.7 billion to $0.3 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Available for Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities Available for sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies $ 10,110,813 $ 9,330,129 $ 780,684 8 % Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 602,376 1,123,255 (520,879 ) (46 )% Total mortgage backed securities 10,713,189 10,453,384 259,805 2 % Investment securities: Municipal bonds 79,606 314,348 (234,742 ) (75 )% Publicly traded equity securities: Preferred stock(1) 371,404 (371,404 ) * Corporate investments 498 1,271 (773 ) (61 )% Other 12,801 114,641 (101,840 ) (89 )% Total investment securities 92,905 801,664 (708,759 ) (88 )% Total available for sale securities $ 10,806,094 $ 11,255,048 $ (448,954 ) (4 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) On January 1, 2008, the Company elected the fair value option for preferred stock in accordance with SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). As a result of this election, preferred stock was classified on the balance sheet as trading securities during 2008; however, during the third quarter of 2008, all preferred stock positions were sold. Available for sale securities represented 22% and 20% of total assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Available for sale securities decreased 4% to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, due primarily to the sale of certain mortgage backed securities in the first half of 2008, offset by the purchase of highly rated securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies in the second half of 2008. All mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are AAA rated. 45 Table of Contents Margin Receivables The margin receivables balance is a component of the margin debt balance, which is reported as a key retail metric of $2.8 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total margin debt balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Margin receivables $ 2,791,168 $ 7,179,175 $ (4,388,007 ) (61 )% Margin held by third parties and other 20,676 81,669 (60,993 ) (75 )% Margin held by the Canadian brokerage business(1) (274,180 ) 274,180 * Margin debt $ 2,811,844 $ 6,986,664 $ (4,174,820 ) (60 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Margin held by the Canadian brokerage business prior to its sale was excluded as it is part of discontinued operations. We believe the decrease in our margin receivables is due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure given the substantial volatility in the financial markets and is not due to an issue with the terms or competitiveness of our margin product. Loans, Net Loans, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Loans held for sale $ $ 100,539 $ (100,539 ) * One to four family 12,979,844 15,506,529 (2,526,685 ) (16 )% Home equity 10,017,183 11,901,324 (1,884,141 ) (16 )% Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 1,570,116 1,910,454 (340,338 ) (18 )% Marine 424,595 526,580 (101,985 ) (19 )% Commercial 214,084 272,156 (58,072 ) (21 )% Credit card 85,851 90,764 (4,913 ) (5 )% Other 4,024 23,334 (19,310 ) (83 )% Unamortized premiums, net 236,766 315,866 (79,100 ) (25 )% Allowance for loan losses (1,080,611 ) (508,164 ) (572,447 ) 113 % Total loans, net $ 24,451,852 $ 30,139,382 $ (5,687,530 ) (19 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Loans, net decreased 19% to $24.5 billion at December 31, 2008 from $30.1 billion at December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to our strategy of reducing balance sheet risk and halting our previous focus on growing the balance sheet. We do not expect to grow our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. In 2007, we entered into a credit default swap (CDS) on $4.0 billion of our first lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. As of December 31, 2008, the balance of the loans 46 Table of Contents covered by the CDS was $2.9 billion. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS provides protection for losses in excess of $4.0 million, but not to exceed approximately $30.3 million. In addition, our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $1.6 million in losses on the portion of the loans covered under the CDS. We have not yet realized any recoveries from the CDS; however, the estimated recoveries from the CDS for the next twelve months were $13.9 million at December 31, 2008, which is reflected in the allowance for loan losses. Deposits Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Money market and savings accounts $ 12,692,729 $ 10,028,115 $ 2,664,614 27 % Sweep deposit accounts 9,650,431 10,112,123 (461,692 ) (5 )% Certificates of deposit 2,363,385 4,156,674 (1,793,289 ) (43 )% Checking accounts 991,477 495,618 495,859 100 % Brokered certificates of deposit 438,224 1,092,225 (654,001 ) (60 )% Total deposits $ 26,136,246 $ 25,884,755 $ 251,491 1 % Deposits represented 57% and 48% of total liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Deposits increased $0.3 billion to $26.1 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, driven by a $2.7 billion increase in money market and savings accounts. This increase was offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposits by $2.4 billion. Deposits generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives. The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $32.3 billion and $32.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Deposits $ 26,136,246 $ 25,884,755 $ 251,491 1 % Less: brokered certificates of deposit (438,224 ) (1,092,225 ) 654,001 (60 )% Deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit 25,698,022 24,792,530 905,492 4 % Customer payables 3,753,332 5,514,675 (1,761,343 ) (32 )% Customer cash balances held by third parties and other 2,805,101 3,286,212 (481,111 ) (15 )% Customer cash balances held by the Canadian brokerage business(1) (883,222 ) 883,222 * Total customer cash and deposits $ 32,256,455 $ 32,710,195 $ (453,740 ) (1 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Customer cash balances held by the Canadian brokerage business prior to its sale were excluded as it is part of discontinued operations. 47 Table of Contents Wholesale Borrowings Wholesale borrowings, which consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 7,381,279 $ 8,932,693 $ (1,551,414 ) (17 )% FHLB advances $ 3,903,600 $ 6,967,406 $ (3,063,806 ) (44 )% Subordinated debentures 427,328 435,830 (8,502 ) (2 )% Other 22,849 43,268 (20,419 ) (47 )% Total other borrowings $ 4,353,777 $ 7,446,504 $ (3,092,727 ) (42 )% Total wholesale borrowings $ 11,735,056 $ 16,379,197 $ (4,644,141 ) (28 )% Wholesale borrowings represented 26% and 30% of total liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in other borrowings of $3.1 billion for the period ended December 31, 2008 was due primarily to a decrease in FHLB advances. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. As a result, we expect these balances to fluctuate over time as our deposits and our interest earning assets fluctuate. Corporate Debt Corporate debt is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Senior notes $ 1,144,662 $ 1,272,742 $ (128,080 ) (10 )% Springing lien notes 1,605,870 1,304,391 301,479 23 % Mandatory convertible notes 445,565 (445,565 ) * Total corporate debt $ 2,750,532 $ 3,022,698 $ (272,166 ) (9 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Corporate debt decreased to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily due to the retirement of the $450 million in mandatory convertible notes during the fourth quarter of 2008 and a decline in senior notes of $121 million in principal related to debt for equity exchanges. Offsetting these decreases was an additional $150.0 million of 12 1/2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel in the first quarter of 2008 and the issuance of $121 million of 12 1/2% springing lien notes in satisfaction of the November 2008 interest payment on these notes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have established liquidity and capital policies. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle. These policies are especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets, which have been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2007 and will likely continue for the foreseeable future. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. We believe this disruption was due to uncertainty in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. Deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and 48 Table of Contents contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans. While the liquidity risk associated with our customer deposits remains at historically high levels, we believe the current level of risk is substantially lower than it was during the fourth quarter of 2007. Capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities. During the second half of 2007, our institutional segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Consequently, this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company raised $2.5 billion in cash from Citadel, the majority of which was used to provide capital to the institutional segment. While this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our retail segment remains profitable and continues to generate capital through retained earnings. We maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimums at our regulated subsidiaries, the most significant of which is E*TRADE Bank. As of December 31, 2008, we held $714.7 million of risk based capital at E*TRADE Bank in excess of the regulatory minimum level required to be considered well capitalized. We raised additional capital in 2008 by issuing shares of common stock in exchange for existing corporate debt, primarily our senior notes, commonly referred to as 3(a)9 exchanges. We completed several 3(a)9 exchanges in the first half of 2008, which resulted in a retirement of $120.8 million of existing corporate debt. We did not complete any of these transactions during the second half of 2008 as the relative prices of our common stock and corporate debt made it unattractive to do so. In addition, we raised approximately $750 million in cash through non core asset sales, including the sale of our Canadian brokerage business and our equity shares in Investsmart(1). We believe the combination of the capital generated in the transactions detailed above, the excess capital held at E*TRADE Bank and the capital that continues to be generated in our retail segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we applied to the U.S. Treasury for funding under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. Our application remains under active consideration and we cannot predict when a final decision will be reached. We estimate this program could provide up to approximately $800 million in new preferred equity, at rates substantially discounted to current market rates. If our application is approved, it would likely be conditional upon additional capital raising activities by us, including possible transactions with existing security holders. Our ability to issue preferred equity under the TARP program would be dependent upon receiving approval from certain of our bond holders and possibly our shareholders. While we do not believe we need this capital to fund our operations, it does have the potential to significantly improve the capital position of both E*TRADE Bank and the parent company, which would enhance our ability to maintain the balance sheet at its current level. (1) The equity shares of Investsmart were sold by our wholly owned subsidiary, E*TRADE Mauritius. 49 Table of Contents Corporate Cash Corporate cash is the primary source of liquidity at the parent company and is available to invest in our regulated subsidiaries. We define corporate cash as cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval. The components of corporate cash as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Parent company cash $ 216,535 $ 251,663 $ (35,128 ) Converging Arrows, Inc. and other cash(1) 218,318 60,701 157,617 Total corporate cash(2) $ 434,853 $ 312,364 $ 122,489 (1) Converging Arrows, Inc. and other consists of corporate subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval and includes E*TRADE Mauritius. (2) Total corporate cash at December 31, 2008 includes $45.3 million that we invested in The Primary Fund and is included as a receivable in the other assets line item, as The Reserve Fund has not indicated when the funds will be distributed back to investors. Parent company cash decreased $35.1 million to $216.5 million as of December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007. The cash received from the sale of the Canadian brokerage business was offset by the $500 million in capital infusions made to E*TRADE Bank during the second half of 2008. The $157.6 million increase in cash to $218.3 million at Converging Arrows, Inc. and other as of December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007 was due almost entirely to the sale of E*TRADE Mauritius equity shares in Investsmart. Cash and Equivalents The consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased by $2.1 billion to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The majority of this balance is cash held in regulated subsidiaries, primarily our Bank and Brokerage, outlined as follows: December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Corporate cash $ 434,853 $ 312,364 $ 122,489 Bank subsidiaries 3,220,232 691,826 2,528,406 Brokerage subsidiaries 339,716 768,677 (428,961 ) Other corporate cash 5,356 5,377 (21 ) Less: Cash reported in Other assets(1) (146,308 ) (146,308 ) Total consolidated cash $ 3,853,849 $ 1,778,244 $ 2,075,605 (1) Cash reported in other assets at December 31, 2008 consists of cash that we invested in The Reserve Funds Primary Fund and is included as a receivable in the other assets line item, as The Reserve Fund has not indicated when the funds will be distributed back to investors. The cash held in our regulated subsidiaries serves as a source of liquidity for those subsidiaries and is not a primary source of capital for the parent company. Cash and Equivalents Held in the Reserve Fund At December 31, 2008, we held cash in The Reserve Funds Primary Fund (the Fund) of $146.3 million, which is included as a receivable in other assets line item on the balance sheet. On September 16, 2008, the Fund reported that its shares had fallen below the standard of $1 per share, which is commonly referred to as breaking the buck. Prior to the fund breaking the buck, we submitted a redemption request for our entire balance in the 50 Table of Contents fund. The following table details our cash held in the Fund at the date the Fund was reported as breaking the buck and at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31,2008 September 15,2008 December 31, 2008 vs.September 15, 2008 Corporate cash $ 45,273 $ 230,326 $ (185,053 ) Bank subsidiaries 82,645 420,456 (337,811 ) Brokerage subsidiaries 18,390 93,559 (75,169 ) Total cash held in the Fund $ 146,308 $ 744,341 $ (598,033 ) On October 31, 2008 and December 3, 2008, the Fund made a distribution to its investors of approximately $26 billion and $14 billion, respectively. We received $377.7 million and $209.2 million, respectively, in connection with these distributions. On December 3, 2008, the Reserve indicated that they are required to distribute the remaining assets of the Fund ratably among the holders of outstanding shares, irrespective of whether the investor made a redemption request before or after the Fund breaking the buck. The statement indicated, assuming a pro rata distribution, the net asset value per share would be $0.985. As a result of that statement, we no longer believe it is probable that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position in the Fund; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $11.2 million(1) related to this investment. The impairment charge of $3.5 million related to our corporate cash was included in gain (loss) on sales of investments, net line item. The impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our banking and brokerage subsidiaries is included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item. The remaining amount of $146.3 million, net of the $11.2 million impairment charge, that we invested in the Fund is included as a receivable in the other assets line item. On February 26, 2009, the Reserve announced that it had adopted a Plan of Liquidation for the orderly liquidation of the assets of the Fund. Under the terms of the plan, which is subject to the supervision of the SEC, the Reserve will continue to make interim distributions up to $0.9172 per share. The Reserve indicated in this announcement that they were taking this approach in order to provide liquidity to investors without prejudicing the legal rights and remedies of any shareholders claims. This announcement does not change our belief that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position upon the ultimate distribution of the fund; however, we cannot state with certainty that we will not ultimately incur additional loss on our remaining position. In addition, we believe it will take a significant amount of time to eventually receive these funds. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, Inc. (Converging Arrows) and E*TRADE Mauritius, a wholly owned subsidiary of Converging Arrows, is limited by regulatory requirements. Any loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and its other non bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arms length, collateralization and other requirements. At December 31, 2008, E*TRADE Bank had approximately $714.7 million of risk based capital above the well capitalized level. In the current credit environment, we plan to keep this significant amount of excess risk based capital at E*TRADE Bank in order to enhance our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining well capitalized status. However, events beyond managements control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Banks ability to meet its future capital requirements. The Companys broker/dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, all of our brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $717.6(2) million at December 31, 2008. While we cannot assure that we would obtain regulatory approval to withdraw any of this excess net capital, $619.4 million is available for dividend while still maintaining a capital level above regulatory early warning guidelines. (1) The impairment charge was calculated based on the Companys investment balance as of September 15, 2008 (the day the Fund broke the buck), which totaled $744.3 million. (2) The excess net capital of the broker dealer subsidiaries included $620.7 million of excess net capital at E*TRADE Clearing, which is a subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank and is also included in the excess risk based capital of E*TRADE Bank. 51 Table of Contents Other Sources of Liquidity We also maintain $325.0 million in uncommitted financing to meet margin lending needs. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding balances, and the full $325.0 million was available. We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity for the Bank. Our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market. At December 31, 2008, the Bank had approximately $9.8 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB. We have the option to make interest payments on our springing lien notes in the form of either cash or additional springing lien notes through May 2010. During the second quarter of 2008, we elected to make our first interest payment of approximately $121 million in cash. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we elected to make our second interest payment of $121 million in the form of additional springing lien notes. We expect to make our next three interest payments, which equates to all interest payments on the springing lien notes through May 2010 in the form of additional springing lien notes. The November 2010 payment is the first interest payment we are required to pay in cash. Corporate Debt Our current senior debt ratings are B2 by Moodys Investor Service, B (developing) by S&P and B (high) by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS). The Companys long term deposit ratings are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service, BB (developing) by S&P and BB by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 years Thereafter Total Certificates of deposit and brokered certificate of deposit (1)(2) $ 2,231,375 $ 383,955 $ 108,450 $ 189,624 $ 2,913,404 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase(2) 4,780,262 1,422,058 274,437 1,174,948 7,651,705 Other borrowings(2)(3) 2,020,693 377,537 645,919 2,407,125 5,451,274 Corporate debt(4) 341,698 1,100,039 1,019,459 3,343,954 5,805,150 Operating lease payments(5) 35,108 52,498 30,332 47,458 165,396 Purchase Obligations(6) 71,317 20,287 4,429 1,889 97,922 FIN 48 liabilities 5,036 15,500 4,122 45,916 70,574 Total contractual obligations $ 9,485,489 $ 3,371,874 $ 2,087,148 $ 7,210,914 $ 22,155,425 (1) Does not include sweep deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts or checking accounts as there are no maturities and /or scheduled contractual payments. (2) Includes annual interest based on the contractual features of each transaction, using market rates at December 31, 2008. Interest rates are assumed to remain at current levels over the life of all adjustable rate instruments. (3) For mandatorily redeemable preferred securities included in other borrowings, does not assume early redemption under current conversion provisions. (4) Includes annual interest payments; does not assume early redemption under current call provisions. See Note 15 Corporate Debt for further details. (5) Includes facilities restructuring leases and excludes estimated future sublease income. (6) Includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by non cancelable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees. Excluded from the table are purchase obligations expected to be settled in cash within one year of the end of the reporting period. 52 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.5 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under home equity lines of credit and $0.5 billion of unused credit card and commercial lines. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no commitments to originate, purchase or sell loans. The Company had a commitment to purchase and sell securities of $0.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The Company also had equity funding commitments of $9.7 million as of December 31, 2008, based on investment plans of venture capital funds, low income housing tax credit partnerships and joint ventures. Additional information related to commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23 Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters. Other Liquidity Matters We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support regulatory capital needs at our Bank, reduce holding company debt, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. RISK MANAGEMENT As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. The identification and management of existing and potential risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management framework, principles and practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. Risks cannot be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Companys risk tolerance. Our businesses expose us to the following four major categories of risk that often overlap: Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in the ability or willingness of a borrower or counterparty to meet the agreed upon terms of their financial obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability to meet current and future cash flow and collateral needs. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates, which could cause fluctuations in our long term earnings or in the value of the Companys net assets. Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal controls process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. We also are subject to other risks that could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. A variety of methodologies and measures are used to monitor, quantify, assess and forecast risk. Measurement criteria, methodologies and calculations are reviewed periodically to assure that risks are represented appropriately. Risks are managed and controlled under policies and related limits that are approved by the Board of Directors and delegated to senior management. The Finance and Risk Oversight Committee, which was established in the second quarter of 2008 and consists of members of the Board of Directors, monitors the risk process and significant risks throughout the 53 Table of Contents Company. In addition to this committee, various enterprise risk committees and departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks, including: Asset Liability Committee E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) has primary responsibility for managing liquidity risk and interest rate risk and reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. Credit Risk Committee The Credit Risk Committee monitors asset quality trends, evaluates market conditions, determines the adequacy for allowance of loan losses, establishes underwriting standards, approves large credit exposures, approves large portfolio purchases and delegates credit approval authority. We use various departments throughout the Company to aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and enterprise risk management. Risk reporting occurs at the business or operating units and is aggregated across the Company through the enterprise risk management process. Credit Risk Management Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where it results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks. Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate. Housing Market Conditions Conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets, which deteriorated sharply during 2007, continued to be extremely challenging during 2008. The significant and abrupt evaporation of secondary market liquidity for various types of mortgage loans, particularly home equity loans, has decreased the overall availability of housing credit. As a result, many borrowers, particularly those in markets with declining housing prices, have been unable to refinance existing loans. This combination of a decline in the availability of credit and a decline in housing prices creates significant credit risk in our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio. Loss Mitigation Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio. This teams primary focus is reducing our exposure to open home equity lines. As of December 31, 2007, we had $6.3 billion of unused lines of credit available under home equity lines of credit. Through a variety of strategies, including voluntary line closures, automatically freezing lines on all delinquent accounts, and freezing lines on loans with materially reduced home equity, we have reduced this amount to $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2008. The team has several other initiatives either in progress or in development which are focused on mitigating losses in our home equity loan portfolio. Those initiatives include improving collection efforts and practices of our servicers as well as increasing our loss recovery efforts to minimize the level of loss on a loan that goes to charge off. 54 Table of Contents We also initiated a loan modification program that resulted in an insignificant number of minor modifications in 2008. Based on the programs we now have in place, we expect the number of modifications to increase significantly in 2009 when compared to 2008. On February 18, 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. The primary focus of this plan is to create requirements and provide incentives to modify mortgages with the goal of avoiding foreclosure. We are analyzing the details of this recently announced program and do not yet know whether it would have a significant impact on our current loan modification programs. In addition, we continue to review our purchased mortgage loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. Our review is primarily focused on identifying loans with early payment defaults, violations of transaction representations and warranties, or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $105.6 million of loans were repurchased by the original sellers. Underwriting Standards Originated Loans During the second half of 2007, we exited our wholesale mortgage origination channel and no longer originate loans through brokers. During the second quarter of 2008, we exited our retail mortgage origination business, which represented our last remaining loan origination channel. We did not originate any loans during the second half of 2008. Prior to the exit of our retail mortgage origination business in the second quarter of 2008, we did originate approximately $158 million in one to four family loans during the first half of 2008. These loans were predominantly prime credit quality first lien mortgage loans secured by a single family residence. We priced our loans primarily based on the risk elements inherent in the loan. We evaluated criteria such as, but not limited to: borrower credit score, loan to value ratio (LTV), documentation type, occupancy type and other risk elements. In the first quarter of 2008, we further adjusted our loan origination practices and pricing to significantly curtail originations of higher risk loans, particularly home equity loans with Fair Isaac Credit Organization (FICO) scores below 700 or a combined loan to value ratio (CLTV) greater than 80%. Our underwriting guidelines were established with a focus on both the credit quality of the borrower as well as the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan. We designed our underwriting guidelines so that our one to four family loans were salable in the secondary market. These guidelines included limitations on loan amount, LTV ratio, debt to income ratio, documentation type and occupancy type. We also required borrowers to obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan to value first lien mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2008, we did not offer any mortgage loan products to our customers. In the future, we expect to partner with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. Underwriting Standards Purchased Loans In the second half of 2007, we altered our business strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. As a result, we did not purchase loans during the year ended December 31, 2008 and we do not anticipate purchasing a significant amount of loans for the foreseeable future. However, we have significantly tightened our underwriting policies for any future loan purchases that do occur. These criteria focus on limiting the acquisition of loans with a high risk of credit loss and require the exclusion of loans with the following attributes: second lien; home equity line of credit; CLTV ratio above 80%; FICO score below 700 at time of origination; and documentation type is not full documentation. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is monitored and managed primarily by the ALCO. We have in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain our flexibility to address liquidity events specific to us or the market in general. We believe liquidity risk management is especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. These deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of our liquidity policies and contingency plans. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the ALCO. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks. Operational Risk Management Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from clearing to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof. Loss of company and customer assets due to fraud represents one of our most significant operational risks. Fraud losses typically result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and use scoring tools which prevent a significant number of fraudulent transactions on a daily basis. However, new techniques and strategies are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. In order to minimize this threat, we offer our customers various security measures, including a token based security system. This token creates a unique password which changes every sixty seconds and must be used along with the customers self selected password to access their account. We believe this system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial loss and impact our reputation. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships and arrangements. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conduct financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers. Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from human error, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in actual losses could be due to Internet performance issues, litigation, change in public policy and our reputation. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Loans We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors, which are documented at the time of 56 Table of Contents origination, include: borrowers debt to income ratio, borrowers credit scores, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type, and loan type. We also review estimated current LTV ratios when monitoring credit risk in our loan portfolios. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, LTV ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In the current housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the LTV ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk. We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably ended up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub prime loans. As of December 31, 2008, sub prime(1) real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans. As noted above, we believe loan type, LTV ratios and borrowers credit scores are key determinants of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans(2) on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a CLTV of 90% or higher or a FICO score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios. The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV and FICO score of our two main loan portfolios, one to four family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands)(3): One toFour Family Home Equity LTV/CLTV at Origination(4) December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 &lt; 70% $ 5,647,650 $ 6,666,212 $ 3,126,274 $ 3,628,619 70% 80% 7,008,860 8,450,977 1,822,797 2,086,277 80% 90% 162,966 202,133 3,312,332 3,871,249 &gt;90% 160,368 187,207 1,755,780 2,315,179 Total $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination(5) 68.8 % 79.1 % Average estimated current LTV/CLTV(6) 90.1 % 99.7 % One toFour Family Home Equity FICO at Origination December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 &gt; 720 $ 8,680,892 $ 10,373,807 $ 6,005,837 $ 6,992,793 719 700 1,750,294 2,089,014 1,591,380 1,898,924 699 680 1,342,967 1,585,613 1,379,218 1,668,427 679 660 784,449 943,538 595,776 757,016 659 620 412,514 503,573 432,862 566,030 &lt;620 8,728 10,984 12,110 18,134 Total $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 (1) Defined as borrowers with FICO scores less than 620 at the time of origination.

Current property values are estimated using the most recent property value data available to us. For properties in which we did not have an updated valuation, we utilized home price indices to estimate the current property value. 57 Table of Contents In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): One toFour Family Home Equity Acquisition Channel December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Purchased from a third party $ 10,646,324 $ 12,904,759 $ 8,873,156 $ 10,638,021 Originated by the Company 2,333,520 2,601,770 1,144,027 1,263,303 Total real estate loans $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 One toFour Family Home Equity Vintage Year December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 2003 and prior $ 577,408 $ 844,670 $ 754,054 $ 901,240 2004 1,309,985 1,669,492 990,138 1,156,867 2005 2,695,718 3,084,336 2,426,000 2,790,423 2006 4,890,407 5,829,146 4,668,721 5,760,906 2007 3,475,661 4,078,885 1,161,667 1,291,888 2008 30,665 16,603 Total real estate loans $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2008 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity Consumer and Other Total Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) December 31, 2008 $ 185,163 1.42 % $ 833,835 8.19 % $ 61,613 2.65 % $ 1,080,611 4.23 % December 31, 2007 $ 18,831 0.12 % $ 459,167 3.79 % $ 30,166 1.05 % $ 508,164 1.66 % (1) Allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category. 58 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008, the allowance for loan losses increased by $572.4 million from the level at December 31, 2007. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during the second half of 2007. During the year ended December, 31 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one to four family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008. The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge offs for the past five years (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Allowance for loan losses, beginning of period $ 508,164 $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 Provision for loan losses 1,583,666 640,078 44,970 54,016 38,121 Allowance acquired through acquisitions(1) 1,547 Charge offs: One to four family (137,974 ) (5,661 ) (616 ) (936 ) (186 ) Home equity (820,201 ) (168,163 ) (15,372 ) (3,929 ) (1,464 ) Recreational vehicle (59,396 ) (32,566 ) (25,253 ) (20,592 ) (18,419 ) Marine (14,278 ) (8,766 ) (6,463 ) (8,009 ) (6,003 ) Credit card (10,854 ) (11,608 ) (11,371 ) (17,286 ) (10,313 ) Other (312 ) (915 ) (2,768 ) (6,095 ) (13,956 ) Total charge offs (1,043,015 ) (227,679 ) (61,843 ) (56,847 ) (50,341 ) Recoveries: One to four family 455 476 167 234 Home equity 8,244 4,368 822 526 310 Recreational vehicle 16,371 15,771 11,959 7,848 9,088 Marine 4,849 4,591 4,091 3,960 3,225 Credit card 782 957 750 380 141 Other 1,095 1,974 3,426 5,488 7,743 Total recoveries 31,796 28,137 21,215 18,436 20,507 Net charge offs (1,011,219 ) (199,542 ) (40,628 ) (38,411 ) (29,834 ) Allowance for loan losses, end of period $ 1,080,611 $ 508,164 $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 Net charge offs to average loans receivable outstanding 3.64 % 0.65 % 0.18 % 0.26 % 0.30 % (1) Acquisition of credit card portfolio in 2004. 59 Table of Contents The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by loan category (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) One to four family $ 185,163 51.3 % $ 18,831 51.3 % $ 7,760 41.7 % $ 4,858 37.0 % $ 2,812 32.3 % Home equity 833,835 39.6 459,167 39.4 31,671 45.3 26,049 42.3 15,183 31.9 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 36,896 6.2 12,622 6.3 11,077 8.8 13,465 14.1 11,343 22.4 Marine 8,339 1.7 4,171 1.7 3,648 2.5 4,590 3.9 4,116 6.3 Commercial 4,063 0.9 2,407 0.9 1,635 0.9 669 0.5 22 Credit card 11,786 0.3 10,123 0.3 10,611 0.5 11,714 1.0 9,078 1.8 Other 529 0.0 843 0.1 1,226 0.3 1,941 1.2 5,127 5.3 Total consumer and other loans 61,613 9.1 30,166 9.3 28,197 13.0 32,379 20.7 29,686 35.8 Total allowance for loan losses $ 1,080,611 100.0 % $ 508,164 100.0 % $ 67,628 100.0 % $ 63,286 100.0 % $ 47,681 100.0 % (1) Represents percentage of loans receivable in category to total loans receivable, excluding premium (discount). Loan losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For credit cards, our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Our policy for one to four family loan charge offs prior to January 1, 2008 was to recognize a charge off when we foreclosed on the property. For home equity loans, our policy prior to January 1, 2008 was to charge off loans when we foreclosed on the property or when the loan had been delinquent for 180 days. As of January 1, 2008, we adjusted our charge off policy mainly for loans in the process of foreclosure. Our updated policy for both one to four family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. As a result of this change, nonperforming loans included a $73.5 million write down as of December 31, 2008. 60 Table of Contents Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 increased by $811.7 million. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge offs on home equity loans, which was driven mainly by the same factors as described above. The continued pressure in the residential real estate market, specifically home price depreciation combined with tighter mortgage lending guidelines, could lead to a higher level of charge offs in future periods. The following graph illustrates the net charge offs by quarter: Nonperforming Assets We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 One to four family $ 593,075 $ 181,315 $ 33,588 $ 17,393 $ 8,009 Home equity 341,255 229,523 32,216 9,568 2,755 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 2,353 2,235 2,579 2,826 1,416 Marine 1,248 1,130 1,439 873 908 Credit card 4,146 3,769 3,795 2,858 2,999 Other 45 470 1,093 462 848 Total consumer and other loans 7,792 7,604 8,906 7,019 6,171 Total nonperforming loans 942,122 418,442 74,710 33,980 16,935 Real estate owned (REO) and other repossessed assets, net 108,105 45,895 12,904 6,555 5,367 Total nonperforming assets, net $ 1,050,227 $ 464,337 $ 87,614 $ 40,535 $ 22,302 Nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable 3.69 % 1.37 % 0.28 % 0.17 % 0.15 % One to four family allowance for loan losses as a percentage of one to four family nonperforming loans receivable 31.22 % 10.39 % 23.10 % 27.93 % 35.11 % Home equity allowance for loan losses as a percentage of home equity nonperforming loans receivable 244.34 % 200.05 % 98.31 % 272.25 % 551.11 % Consumer and other allowance for loan losses as a percentage of consumer and other nonperforming loans receivable 790.72 % 396.71 % 316.61 % 461.31 % 481.06 % Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable 114.70 % 121.44 % 90.52 % 186.24 % 281.55 % 61 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008 our nonperforming assets, net increased $585.9 million to $1.1 billion. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one to four family loans of $411.8 million and home equity loans of $111.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007. We expect nonperforming loan levels to increase over time due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets. The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter: The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net decreased from 121% at December 31, 2007 to 115% at December 31, 2008. This decrease was driven primarily by an increase in one to four family non performing loans, which have a significantly lower level of expected loss when compared to home equity loans. The balance of nonperforming loans includes loans delinquent 90 to 179 days as well as loans delinquent 180 days and greater. We believe the distinction between these two periods is important as loans delinquent 180 days and greater have been written down to their expected recovery value, whereas loans delinquent 90 to 179 days have not. We believe the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days is an important measure of the adequacy of the allowance as these loans are expected to drive the vast majority of future charge offs. Additional charge offs on loans delinquent 180 days are possible if home prices decline beyond our current expectations, but we do not anticipate these charge offs to be significant, particularly when compared to the expected charge offs on loans delinquent 90 to 179 days. We consider this ratio especially important for one to four family loans as we expect the balances of loans delinquent 180 days and greater to increase in the future due to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market. The following table shows the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days for each of our major loan categories (dollars in thousands): December 31,2008 Allowance as a % of LoansDelinquent 90 to 179 days One to four family loans $ 272,869 67.86 % Home equity loans 278,867 299.01 % Consumer and other loans 6,764 910.90 % Total loans delinquent 90 to 179 days $ 558,500 193.48 % 62 Table of Contents In addition to nonperforming assets, we monitor loans where a borrowers past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan (Special Mention loans). We classify loans as Special Mention when they are between 30 and 89 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for Special Mention loans (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 One to four family $ 594,379 $ 296,764 Home equity 407,386 291,675 Consumer and other loans 33,298 23,800 Total Special Mention loans $ 1,035,063 $ 612,239 Special Mention loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable 4.05 % 2.00 % The trend in Special Mention loan balances is generally indicative of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods, as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off. One to four family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan. Our home equity loans are generally secured by real estate assets; however, the majority of these loans are secured in a second lien position, which substantially increases the potential loss when compared to a first lien position. During 2008, Special Mention loans increased by $422.8 million to approximately $1.0 billion. While our level of Special Mention loans can fluctuate significantly in any given period, we do not believe the overall increase we observed in 2008 will be repeated in 2009. The following graph illustrates the Special Mention loans by quarter: Securities We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe our asset backed securities portfolio, which we sold in the fourth quarter of 2007, represented our highest concentration of credit risk within the securities portfolio. Subsequent to the sale of that portfolio, we believe our 63 Table of Contents highest concentration of remaining credit risk, while considerably lower than the credit risk inherent in asset backed securities, is our CMO portfolio.

As a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities, they were written down to their estimated fair market value by recording a $95.0 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2008. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods. Derivatives Credit risk is an element of the recurring fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments. We monitor the collateral requirements on derivative instruments through credit support agreements, which reduce risk by permitting the netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. We considered the impact of credit risk on the fair value measurement for derivative instruments, particularly those in net liability positions, to be mitigated by the enforcement of credit support agreements, and the collateral requirements therein. Our credit risk analysis for derivative instruments also considered whether the cost to mitigate the credit loss exposure on derivative instruments in net asset positions would have resulted in material adjustments to the valuations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the consideration of credit risk, the Companys or the counterpartys, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments. 64 Table of Contents SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. Allowance for Loan Losses Description The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, we perform periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and loss forecasting assumptions. At December 31, 2008, our allowance for loan losses was $1.1 billion on $25.3 billion of loans designated as held for investment. Judgments The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by loan type: one to four family, home equity and consumer and other loan portfolios. Our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios are separated into risk segments based on key risk factors, which include but are not limited to channel of loan origination, documentation type, loan product type and LTV ratio. Based upon the segmentation, probable losses are determined with expected loss rates in each segment. The additional protection provided by mortgage insurance and the credit default swap has been factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. The expected recovery from the liquidation of foreclosed real estate and expected recoveries from loan sellers related to contractual guarantees are also factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. Our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios represented 51% and 40%, respectively, of the total gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. For the consumer and other loan portfolio, management establishes loss estimates for each consumer portfolio based on credit characteristics and observation of the existing markets. The expected recoveries from the sale of repossessed collateral are factored into the expected loss on defaulted consumer loans based on current liquidation experience. Our consumer and other loan portfolio represented 9% of the total gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Effects if Actual Results Differ The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and 65 Table of Contents judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. These losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank. Fair Value Measurements Description Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine the fair value of our financial instruments and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis in accordance with SFAS No. 157. We will not adopt certain provisions of this statement until January 1, 2009 as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Examples of assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 include reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets measured at fair value in impairment tests under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), nonfinancial long lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144) as well as nonfinancial liabilities for exit or disposal activities initially measured at fair value under SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). Judgments In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including market, income and or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The standard describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys transfers in and out of Level 3 are as of the beginning of the reporting period on a quarterly basis. Effects if Actual Results Differ As of December 31, 2008, 23% and 1% of our total assets and total liabilities, respectively, represented instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008 represented less than 1% of our total assets and total liabilities. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. 66 Table of Contents Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments Description We generally classify our investments in mortgage backed securities, debt securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net for our banking and brokerage investments and gain (loss) on sales of investments, net for our corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $96.2 million, $168.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Judgments The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies include to be announced (TBA) securities and mortgage pass through certificates. The fair value of mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies is determined using quoted market prices, recent market transactions and spread data for similar instruments. Mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. CMOs, generally non agency mortgage backed securities, are typically valued using market observable data, when available, including recent external market transactions for similar instruments. We also utilized a pricing service to corroborate the market observability of our inputs used in the fair value measurements. The valuations of CMOs reflect our best estimate of what market participants would consider in pricing the financial instruments. We consider the price transparency for these financial instruments to be a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value. Due to the limited activity and low level of transparency around inputs to their valuation, a portion of these securities are classified as Level 3 even though we believe that Level 2 inputs could likely be obtainable in a more active market. We also make estimates about the timing for recognizing losses in the consolidated statement of income (loss) based on market conditions and other factors. Management uses judgment to estimate the future cash flows associated with each security held at a loss and to assess the probability of collecting those cash flows. Management uses a qualitative and quantitative risk approach to evaluate each security held at a loss, which includes assessing underlying collateral characteristics to determine if there has been an adverse change in the amount or timing of the estimated future cash flows, which would indicate other than temporary impairment. The Company recognizes an impairment charge by writing the amortized cost basis of the security down to its fair market value when the Company believes that there has been a probable adverse change in the estimated future cash flows of the security. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. Effects if Actual Results Differ In general, level classification transfers in and out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2008 were driven by changes in price transparency in the CMO market throughout the year. Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2008 include $3.9 million of CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008. While the Companys fair value estimates of Level 3 instruments as of December 31, 2008 utilized observable inputs where available, the valuation included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of 67 Table of Contents market information considered and the financial instruments were therefore classified as Level 3. The Company recorded a $118.8 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 on CMOs classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. The Company recorded a $1.0 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008 and Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. Of the $95.0 million impairment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the CMO portfolio, $93.6 million related to CMOs classified as Level 3 as of January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008. Determining if a security is other than temporarily impaired is complex and requires judgment by management about circumstances that are inherently uncertain. In particular, these estimates require management to estimate the amount and timing of credit losses on the underlying loans supporting the security. Subsequent evaluations of these securities, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in additional impairment in future periods. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized cost were impaired, we would record a pre tax loss of $439.9 million. Accounting for Financial Derivatives Description We enter into derivative transactions to reduce the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. The majority of derivative transactions we entered into as of December 31, 2008 were cash flow hedges. These hedges, which include a combination of interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and purchased options on caps and floors, are used primarily to reduce the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable rate liabilities and assets and forecasted issuances of liabilities. These cash flow hedge relationships are treated as effective hedges as long as the future issuances of liabilities remain probable and the hedges continue to meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that hedge cash flows associated with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and home equity lines of credit are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as unrealized gains or losses, for both active and terminated hedges. As of December 31, 2008, we had an unrealized pre tax loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $671.3 million related to cash flow hedges. Judgments If the derivatives in these cash flow hedge relationships are determined to be effective hedges, the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss are included in operating interest expense or operating interest income as a yield adjustment during the same periods in which the related interest on the hedged item affects earnings. If the derivatives are determined not to be effective hedges, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The majority of cash flow hedge relationships are hedges of the potential change in cash flows associated with the forecasted issuance of debt. In order to be considered an effective hedge, the forecasted issuance of debt must be considered probable as of the balance sheet date. The future issuance of this debt, including repurchase agreements, is largely dependent on the market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market. As of December 31, 2008, we believe the forecasted issuance of all debt in cash flow hedge relationships is probable. However, unexpected changes in market conditions in future periods could impact our ability to issue 68 Table of Contents this debt. We believe the forecasted issuance of debt in the form of repurchase agreements is most susceptible to an unexpected change in market conditions. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. In particular, if we determined that the forecasted issuance of debt associated with our cash flow hedges was no longer probable, the $671.3 million pre tax loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss) in the period in which this determination was made. This loss would have a material adverse effect on the regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank and our results of operations. Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances Description In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense (benefit) based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income (loss). Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion, net of a valuation allowance (on state and foreign country deferred tax assets) of $127.7 million. At December 31, 2007 we had net deferred tax assets of $550.2 million, net of a valuation allowance (on state and foreign country deferred tax assets) of $91.8 million. Judgments Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income tax expense (benefit), our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations, resolution with taxing authorities of uncertain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. The most significant tax related judgment made by management was the determination of whether to provide for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on 69 Table of Contents identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our retail and institutional segments separately and determined that our net operating losses in 2007 and 2008 were due solely to the credit losses in our institutional segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities portfolio and our home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased the business activities which we believe are the root cause of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in 2007 and 2008. Our retail segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2008, which is considered significant, objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believe we are able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. Effects if Actual Results Differ Changes in our tax expense (benefit) due to the actual effective tax rates differing from our estimates, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company. As of December 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Description We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets net of amortization at December 31, 2008 were $386.1 million, which have useful lives between five and thirty years. Judgments In connection with our annual impairment test of goodwill, we concluded that the goodwill was not impaired. We recognize that as of December 31, 2008, our market capitalization was significantly less than the amount of goodwill recorded on our books. We believe this condition is due to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which has significantly impacted the value of our loan portfolio assumed within our market capitalization. The value of this portfolio is contained in our balance sheet management business, which is a reporting unit in the institutional segment. The goodwill for the balance sheet management business was written off in entirety in the fourth quarter of 2007. The vast majority of the goodwill remaining on our balance sheet is connected to our retail brokerage business, which is a reporting unit in the retail segment. Our evaluation indicates that this unit has a fair value far in excess of the goodwill assigned to it. 70 Table of Contents Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If managements estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occur, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized. Valuation and Expensing of Share Based Payments Description We value and expense employee share based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each periods compensation expense attributed to these options. Judgments We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are managements best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of employees forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by approximately 7%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods. 71 Table of Contents STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES The following table outlines the information required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.

In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements. We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. The FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances based on the security of pledged home mortgages and other assets principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. Government provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2008, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $3.9 billion at interest rates ranging from 1.43% to 5.56% and at a weighted average rate of 4.15%. We also raise funds by selling securities under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The counterparties to these agreements hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed and variable rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Banks term investment option and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs. The following table sets forth information regarding the weighted average interest rates and the highest and average month end balances of our borrowings (dollars in thousands): Yearly Weighted Average EndingBalance Weighted AverageRate(1) MaximumAmount AtMonth End Balance Rate At or for the year ended December 31, 2008: FHLB advances $ 3,903,600 4.15 % $ 6,549,104 $ 4,667,436 4.69 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings(2) $ 7,828,021 3.04 % $ 8,153,722 $ 7,736,906 4.11 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2007: FHLB advances $ 6,967,406 4.80 % $ 9,959,297 $ 7,071,762 5.15 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings(2) $ 9,371,975 5.11 % $ 14,593,923 $ 12,261,145 5.25 % At or for the year ended December 31, 2006: FHLB advances $ 4,865,466 5.15 % $ 5,053,982 $ 3,488,184 4.75 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings(2) $ 10,212,993 5.17 % $ 12,483,929 $ 10,980,134 5.00 % (1) Excludes hedging costs.

As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement of income (loss), as that is not permitted under GAAP. Tier 1 Capital Adjusted equity capital used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios at E*TRADE Bank as required by the OTS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest Rate Risk The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable rate and fixed rate assets and liabilities and we utilize derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense: Interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may re price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch. The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short and long term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income. Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize. Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2008, 93% of our total assets were enterprise interest earning assets. At December 31, 2008, approximately 70% of our total assets were residential real estate loans and available for sale mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment. When real estate loans prepay, unamortized premiums are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of unamortized premiums may result in lower than anticipated yields. The ALCO reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on loan production volumes and prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy. Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and wholesale borrowings. Cash provided to us through deposits is the primary source of our funding. Our key deposit products include sweep accounts, money market and savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Our wholesale borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Customer payables, which represents customer cash contained within our broker dealers, is an additional source of funding. In addition, the parent company has issued a significant amount of corporate debt. Our deposit accounts and customer payables tend to be less rate sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities re price as interest rates change. Sweep, money market and savings accounts re price at managements discretion Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and corporate debt generally have fixed rates. 82 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Strategy Our strategy is to profitably grow our retail customer franchise and mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet. We plan to grow our retail customer franchise by offering online brokerage and related products and services, including investor focused banking and asset gathering products and services. We believe we can accomplish this growth by appealing to retail investors, especially customers of traditional brokerages, who are attracted to our low cost, easy to use and innovative capabilities. Our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses. We believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength. We are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and or restructuring certain non core operations. We believe these changes will better align our business with the retail investor. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; the weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; the performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; and market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market, including securities sold and agreements to repurchase. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers; deepening customer acceptance of our products and services; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. 22 Table of Contents Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 Customer Activity Metrics(1): Retail customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 112.2 $ 185.0 $ 191.3 (39 )% Net new customer assets (dollars in billions)(2) $ 5.4 $ (11.3 ) $ 3.2 * Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions) $ 32.3 $ 32.7 $ 33.0 (1 )% Total daily average revenue trades 188,116 177,900 153,146 6 % Average commission per trade $ 10.88 $ 11.72 $ 11.97 (7 )% End of period total accounts 4,533,034 4,287,240 4,002,496 6 % Company Financial Metrics(1): Corporate cash (dollars in millions) $ 434.9 $ 312.4 $ 244.4 39 % E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital $ 714.7 $ 435.1 $ 134.2 64 % Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 1,080.6 $ 508.2 $ 67.6 113 % Allowance for loan losses as a % of nonperforming loans 114.70 % 121.44 % 90.52 % (6.74 )% Nonperforming loans as a % of gross loans receivable 3.69 % 1.37 % 0.28 % 2.32 % Enterprise net interest spread (basis points) 252 264 285 (5 )% Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 46.9 $ 56.1 $ 44.9 (16 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Metrics have been represented to exclude activity from discontinued operations. All discussions, unless otherwise noted, are based on metrics from continuing operations. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2008, net new customer assets were $6.4 billion excluding the sale of Retirement Advisors of America (RAA). Customer Activity Metrics Changes in retail customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in retail customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities, which declined substantially in 2008. Net new customer assets are total inflows to all new and existing customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing customer accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new customers. Customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. DARTs are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. As a result, this metric is impacted by both the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders, mass affluent and main street customers. End of period total accounts is an indicator of the Companys ability to attract and retain customers. Company Financial Metrics Corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company. It is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital is the excess capital that E*TRADE Bank has compared to the regulatory minimum well capitalized threshold and is an indicator of E*TRADE Banks ability to absorb future loan losses. 23 Table of Contents Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to the expected charge offs in our loan portfolio over the next twelve months. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is a general indicator of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. Changes in this ratio are also driven by changes in the mix of our loan portfolio. Nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable is an indicator of the performance of our total loan portfolio. Enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Enterprise interest earning assets, in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread, are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Significant Events in 2008 Strengthening Our Core Asset the Retail Customer One of our key strategic objectives for 2008 was to strengthen our retail customer base and ensure the credit issues in our balance sheet did not negatively impact our customer base. We believe we have made significant progress in this area throughout 2008. Highlights of our progress during the year ended December 31, 2008 are as follows: Opened 1,032,000 gross new accounts and produced 246,000 net new accounts; Net new customer asset flows of $5.4 billion ($6.4 billion excluding the sale of RAA); Customer cash and deposit balances decreased slightly to $32.3 billion; and Total DARTs of 188,000, up 6% from the prior year. Execution of Our Capital Plan E*TRADE Bank had excess risk based capital (excess to the regulatory minimum well capitalized threshold) of $714.7 million, including $650 million of capital contributed by the parent company, E*TRADE Financial Corporation; We had corporate cash of $434.9 million; and We completed four key non core asset sales resulting in net proceeds of approximately $750 million: the corporate aircraft related assets; RAA; the Canadian brokerage business; and our equity shares in Investsmart(1). Exit of the Direct Retail Lending Business We announced the exit of our direct retail lending business, which was our last remaining loan origination channel (we exited our wholesale mortgage lending channel in 2007). Therefore, the results of operations of the entire direct retail lending business are reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. In future periods, we plan to partner with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. Retirement of Corporate Debt In November 2008, we retired the entire balance of our $450 million 6.125% subordinated notes due 2019. The notes were part of the mandatory convertible debt securities issued in 2005 and were retired in connection (1) The equity shares of Investsmart were sold by our wholly owned subsidiary, E*TRADE Mauritius. 24 Table of Contents with the issuance of 25 million shares of our common stock at $18 per share. Additionally, we exchanged $120.8 million in principal of our senior notes through debt for equity exchanges. Completion of Citadel Investment In January 2008, the Company issued an additional $150.0 million of springing lien notes in accordance with the terms of the agreement with Citadel. This was the final note issuance under the agreement with Citadel and brought the total springing lien notes outstanding to $1.9 billion in principal(1). In connection with this issuance, the Company received $150.0 million in cash. Additionally, the Company issued to Citadel the remaining 46.7 million shares of common stock that had been required to be issued under the agreement. Enhancements to our Retail Investor Focused Products and Services We introduced E*TRADE Mobile Pro, which offers wireless customers access to their E*TRADE accounts. Mobile Pro offers BlackBerry&reg; smartphone users real time streaming stock and options quotes, the ability to trade equities and options and brokerage and bank account cash transfers, among other features.

We launched Retirement QuickPlan, which provides a quick assessment of an individuals or familys retirement savings and investing plan as well as guidelines to get on track with personal retirement goals. Ranked #1 Online Broker by SmartMoney Magazine For the second year in a row, SmartmoneyTM ranked the Company as the #1 Online Discount Broker. The Company earned five out of five stars in the Research, Trading Tools, Banking Service and Mutual Funds and Investment Products categories. Significant Events in 2007 Citadel Investment of $2.5 Billion Including Sale of Asset Backed Securities Portfolio The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base. As a result, we believe it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash, which would in turn stabilize our balance sheet and our customer base. On November 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio, 84.7 million shares of common stock (2) in the Company and approximately $1.8 billion in 12 1/2% springing lien notes(3). We believe this transaction provided timely stability for our business and helped alleviate customer concerns. (1) The $1.9 billion in principal does not include the $121.0 million of capitalized interest in November 2008, which resulted in $2.1 billion in principal of springing lien notes outstanding to Citadel as of December 31, 2008. (2) The 84.7 million shares of common stock were issued in increments: 14.8 million upon initial closing in November 2007; 23.2 million upon Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act approval in December 2007; and 46.7 million shares are expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2008 as the Company has received all necessary regulatory approvals. (3) Included in the $1.8 billion issuance is $186 million of 12 1/2% springing lien notes in exchange for $186 million of the Companys senior notes that were owned by Citadel. The $1.8 billion in 12 1 /2% springing lien notes includes $100 million in notes issued to BlackRock in connection with the transaction. The $1.8 billion in 12 1/2% springing lien notes represents the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and does not include the additional $150 million of springing lien notes issued in January 2008 in accordance with the terms of the agreement with Citadel. 25 Table of Contents Launch of Global Trading Platform We launched our Global Trading Platform, which provides the ability to buy, sell and hold foreign equities in local currencies to investors who seek liquidity and diversity in their portfolios.

The continued deterioration in the residential real estate and credit markets, as well as the nearly unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets, had a significant impact on our financial performance during 2008. The losses in our institutional segment caused by this deterioration more than offset the strong underlying performance of our retail segment, resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of $809.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our retail customer base showed positive growth trends during the year, including the addition of approximately 246,000 net new accounts and net inflows of customer assets of approximately $5.4 billion. We believe these are indications that our retail segment has not only stabilized, but has returned to modest growth. 26 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions) December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Total assets $ 48.5 $ 56.8 (15 )% Total enterprise interest earning assets $ 45.0 $ 52.3 (14 )% Loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets 63 % 71 % (8 )% Retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities 70 % 61 % 9 % The decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of $5.7 billion in loans, net and a decrease of $4.4 billion in margin receivables. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations of $2.9 billion. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. During this period, we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we increased our excess risk based capital at E*TRADE Bank by 64% to $714.7 million compared to prior year. In connection with this strategy and the Citadel Investment, we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through January 1, 2010. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2008 Compared to 2007 We had a net loss from continuing operations of $809.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to an increase in our provision for loan losses of $943.6 million to $1.6 billion. In addition, we incurred losses of $153.8 million, net of hedges, on our preferred stock in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) during the period ended December 31, 2008. The losses in our institutional segment, which included both of these items, more than offset our retail segment income, which was $608.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, we made the decision to sell our Canadian brokerage business and we decided to close our direct retail lending business. As a result, the financial results for both the Canadian brokerage business and the direct retail lending business have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, we re defined Total net revenue by removing Provision for loan losses and separately stating it as its own line item and reclassified hedge ineffectiveness recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), from Other operating expense to the Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item. We report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of the performance in our banking and balance sheet management businesses. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and past acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo. Similarly, we report gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and 27 Table of Contents securities, net is the result of activities in our operations, namely our balance sheet management business, including impairment on our available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Revenue: Operating interest income $ 2,469,940 $ 3,523,055 $ (1,053,115 ) (30 )% Operating interest expense (1,201,934 ) (1,939,456 ) 737,522 (38 )% Net operating interest income 1,268,006 1,583,599 (315,593 ) (20 )% Commission 515,551 663,642 (148,091 ) (22 )% Fees and service charges 199,956 230,567 (30,611 ) (13 )% Principal transactions 84,882 102,180 (17,298 ) (17 )% Loss on loans and securities, net (195,483 ) (2,465,474 ) 2,269,991 (92 )% Other revenue 52,684 47,212 5,472 12 % Total non interest income (expense) 657,590 (1,421,873 ) 2,079,463 * Total net revenue $ 1,925,596 $ 161,726 $ 1,763,870 * * Percentage not meaningful Total net revenue increased to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase was primarily due to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 20% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which include margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to the planned decline in enterprise interest earning assets during 2008. 28 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

(4) Non operating interest earning assets consist of property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets that do not generate operating interest income. Some of these assets generate corporate interest income. (5) Non operating interest bearing liabilities consist of corporate debt, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities that do not generate operating interest expense. Some of these liabilities generate corporate interest expense. (6) Enterprise net interest income is taxable equivalent basis net operating interest income excluding corporate interest income and corporate interest expense, stock conduit interest income and expense and interest earned on customer cash held by third parties. Management believes this non GAAP measure is useful to analysts and investors as it is a measure of the net operating interest income generated by our operations. (7) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.2 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE Financial, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. Other consists of net operating interest earned on average stock conduit assets of $1.3 million and $303.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were not any stock conduit assets at December 31, 2008. 29 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.52 % 2.64 % 2.85 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.66 % 2.81 % 3.03 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 105.40 % 105.10 % 105.94 % Return on average: Total assets (0.99 )% (2.34 )% 1.26 % Total shareholders equity (18.98 )% (34.86 )% 16.56 % Average equity to average total assets 5.20 % 6.73 % 7.61 % Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 16% to $46.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily the result of a decrease in our available for sale portfolio, margin receivables and loans, net, offset by an increase in cash and equivalents. Average available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities decreased 41% to $9.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of certain mortgage backed securities in the first quarter of 2008 and the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Average margin receivables decreased 17% to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. We believe this decrease was due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure given the substantial volatility in the financial markets. Average loans, net decreased 10% to $27.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of our focus on growing the one to four family loan portfolio in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 17% to $44.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in repurchase agreements and other borrowings, FHLB advances and customer payables. Average repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased 37% to $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Average FHLB advances decreased 34% to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Repurchase agreements and other borrowings are the primary wholesale funding sources for our loans, net and available for sale securities portfolios. The decreases in these balances were the result of paying down these liabilities as we decreased the size of our balance sheet during 2008. Average customer payables decreased 25% to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was related primarily to the sale of our Canadian brokerage business during the third quarter of 2008. Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 12 basis points to 2.52% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was driven in part by an atypical spread among two key benchmark interest rates: federal funds and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The majority of our interest earning assets and liabilities are linked, either directly or indirectly, to these benchmark interest rates. We believe this spread will return to more normalized levels in future periods. In addition, we plan to reduce the rates paid on our Complete Savings Account to be more consistent with current market rates. We believe the combined impact of these two items will result in a modest increase to our net interest spread in future periods. 30 Table of Contents Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Operating interest income: Operating interest income, gross $ 2,443,886 $ 3,509,453 $ (1,065,567 ) (30 )% Hedge income 26,054 13,602 12,452 92 % Operating interest income 2,469,940 3,523,055 (1,053,115 ) (30 )% Operating interest expense: Operating interest expense, gross (1,127,026 ) (1,936,256 ) 809,230 (42 )% Hedge expense (74,908 ) (3,200 ) (71,708 ) * Operating interest expense (1,201,934 ) (1,939,456 ) 737,522 (38 )% Net operating interest income $ 1,268,006 $ 1,583,599 $ (315,593 ) (20 )% * Percentage not meaningful Commission Commission revenue decreased 22% to $515.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was due almost entirely to a decrease of $142.6 million, or 99%, in our institutional commission revenue as a result of the exit of our institutional brokerage operations. Commission revenue from our retail segment, which is the sole source of commission revenue in future periods, remained stable for the year ended December 31, 2008 declining by only 1% compared to 2007. The primary factors that affect our retail commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, exchange traded funds, contract for difference and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. DARTs increased 6% to 188,116 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Our U.S. DART volume increased 5% and our international DARTs grew by 9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option related DARTs as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs represented 15% and 16% of U.S. trading volume for the periods ending December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Average commission per trade decreased 7% to $10.88 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily a function of the product and customer mix. The overall poor performance of the equity markets for the year ended December 31, 2008 disproportionately impacted higher commission products, such as corporate services transactions and mutual funds. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent customers, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation, win back and other promotional campaigns also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 13% to $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a lower order flow revenue, advisory management fees and CDO 31 Table of Contents management fees. The decrease in advisory management fees was primarily due to our sale of RAA. The decrease in CDO management fees was due to the sale of our collateral management agreements during the first quarter of 2008. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 17% to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities. Loss on Loans and Securities, Net Loss on loans and securities, net was $195.5 million and $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Loss on sales of loans, net $ (783 ) $ (14,343 ) $ 13,560 (95 )% Gain (loss) on securities and other investments 40,289 (2,911 ) 43,200 * Loss on asset backed securities sale to Citadel (2,241,031 ) 2,241,031 * Loss on impairment (102,909 ) (168,739 ) 65,830 (39 )% Loss on trading securities, net (134,297 ) (33,441 ) (100,856 ) 302 % Hedge ineffectiveness 2,217 (5,009 ) 7,226 * Loss on securities, net (194,700 ) (2,451,131 ) 2,256,431 (92 )% Loss on loans and securities, net $ (195,483 ) $ (2,465,474 ) $ 2,269,991 (92 )% * Percentage not meaningful The loss on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to losses on our preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which experienced record price declines and volatility during the third quarter of 2008. Based upon our concerns about continuing market instability, all of our positions were liquidated during the third quarter of 2008, resulting in a pre tax loss of $153.8 million, net of hedges, that was recognized in loss on trading securities, net. We recognized $95.0 million of impairment on certain securities in our CMO portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods. In addition, we recognized $7.7 million of impairment related to the funds held in the Reserve Funds Primary Fund. For additional information about the Primary Fund, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources on page 48. The loss on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 12% to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in other revenue was due to income from the cash surrender value of Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI), which was entered into during the third quarter of 2007. 32 Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio, which began in the second half of 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one to four family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008. Operating Expense The components of operating expense and the year over year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 383,385 $ 434,785 $ (51,400 ) (12 )% Clearing and servicing 185,082 270,199 (85,117 ) (32 )% Advertising and market development 175,250 138,675 36,575 26 % Communications 96,792 98,347 (1,555 ) (2 )% Professional services 94,070 99,193 (5,123 ) (5 )% Occupancy and equipment 85,766 85,189 577 1 % Depreciation and amortization 82,483 83,198 (715 ) (1 )% Amortization of other intangibles 35,746 40,472 (4,726 ) (12 )% Impairment of goodwill 101,208 (101,208 ) * Facility restructuring and other exit activities 29,502 27,183 2,319 9 % Other 122,139 195,384 (73,245 ) (37 )% Total operating expense $ 1,290,215 $ 1,573,833 $ (283,618 ) (18 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Operating expense decreased 18% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by decreases in compensation and benefits, clearing and servicing, impairment of goodwill and other expense. These decreases were offset slightly by an increase in advertising and market development expense. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 12% to $383.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base and decreased variable compensation during the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to 2007. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense decreased 32% to $185.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease is related primarily to the exit of our institutional brokerage operations, which resulted in lower clearing expenses. 33 Table of Contents Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 26% to $175.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This planned increase was aimed at restoring customer confidence as well as expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. Impairment of Goodwill Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007. There was no such impairment for the year ended December 31, 2008. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These costs were due primarily to the exit of certain facilities during the year ended December 31, 2008. Slightly offsetting the restructuring expense is the gain on the sale of RAA of $2.8 million which was recorded in the second quarter of 2008. Other Other expense decreased 37% to $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was primarily due to items that are not expected to recur in future periods. During the first quarter of 2008, we sold our corporate aircraft related assets, which resulted in a $23.7 million gain on sale. During the second quarter of 2008, we realized approximately $13 million of insurance recoveries of fraud losses incurred in prior periods as well as other recoveries to legal reserves. The decrease is also due to $35.1 million in expense recorded for certain legal and regulatory matters for the year ended December 31, 2007. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased to an expense of $330.6 million for 2008 compared to an expense of $123.1 million for 2007, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Other income (expense): Corporate interest income $ 7,210 $ 5,755 $ 1,455 25 % Corporate interest expense (362,160 ) (172,482 ) (189,678 ) 110 % Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net (4,230 ) 35,980 (40,210 ) (112 )% Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt 10,084 (19 ) 10,103 * Equity in income of investments and venture funds 18,462 7,665 10,797 141 % Total other income (expense) $ (330,634 ) $ (123,101 ) $ (207,533 ) 169 % * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted primarily of corporate interest expense resulting from our corporate debt, which included the springing lien notes, senior notes and mandatory convertible notes. Corporate interest expense increased 110% to $362.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the interest expense on the springing lien notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008. During 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary, E*TRADE Mauritius, sold its equity shares in Investsmart for proceeds of approximately $145 million, which 34 Table of Contents resulted in a gain on sale of $22.3 million recorded in equity in income of investments and venture funds. During 2007, we sold our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. The gain on early extinguishment of debt is primarily due to a gain of $21.5 million recognized on the exchange of our senior notes for shares of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2008. The gain of $21.5 million is offset by a loss of $10.8 million related to the early extinguishment of FHLB advances and a loss of $0.6 million on the prepayment of debt related to the sale of the corporate aircraft. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $469.5 million and $732.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was (36.7)% compared to (33.7)% for 2007. For additional information, see Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. Our 2008 effective tax rate included a number of tax benefits and expenses which were incremental to the amount of tax accrued based on the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The most significant items are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions): Year EndedDecember 31, 2008Tax Expense Incremental tax benefits Tax exempt income $ 10.2 FIN 48 settlements and reversals 14.0 Low income housing tax credits 2.4 Total tax benefits 26.6 Incremental tax expenses Non deductible officers compensation 1.6 Sweden valuation allowance 7.3 Removal of foreign earnings from permanently reinvested 1.8 Tax rate differential of international operations 7.9 Non deductible portion of interest expense on springing lien notes 24.6 Total tax expense 43.2 Incremental tax expense $ 16.6 The Company expects the 2009 effective tax rate to increase when compared to the tax rates for 2008. More specifically, we expect the 2009 effective tax rate to be based on a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 37 38% plus an additional fixed amount of income tax expense between $25 and $30 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required, the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. As of December 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We 35 Table of Contents reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our retail and institutional segments separately and determined that our net operating losses in 2007 and 2008 were due solely to the credit losses in our institutional segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased the business activities which we believe are the root cause of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in 2007 and 2008. Our retail segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2008, which is considered significant, objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believe we are able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in our results of operations. This volatility is isolated almost entirely to our institutional segment. Our forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding our estimate of future expected credit losses, which we believe to be the most variable component of our forecasts of future taxable income. We believe this variability could create a book loss in our overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting our overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which we expect to realize our deferred tax assets. Conversely, we believe our retail segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which we believe we can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which we estimate we will realize our deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company. We will continue to monitor and update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need for a valuation allowance. 36 Table of Contents Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold our Canadian brokerage business to Scotiabank. The sale resulted in proceeds of approximately $515 million, including $54 million in repatriation of capital prior to the close and a pre tax gain of $429.0 million. We also exited our direct retail lending business, which was our last remaining loan origination channel (we exited our wholesale mortgage lending channel in 2007). Therefore, the results of operations of our Canadian brokerage business, including the gain on sale, and the entire direct retail lending business are reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. The following table outlines the components of discontinued operations (dollars of thousands): Years EndedDecember 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Lending loss, net of tax $ (6,235 ) $ (21,612 ) $ 15,377 (71 )% Canada income, net of tax 10,910 22,195 (11,285 ) (51 )% Canada gain on disposal, net of tax 268,798 268,798 * Canada tax benefit of excess tax basis over book basis 24,121 24,121 * Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 297,594 $ 583 $ 297,011 * * Percentage not meaningful. The benefit of excess tax basis over book basis is related to our Canadian brokerage business, which resulted from the difference between the tax and financial reporting bases of the business. We recognized this difference in the second quarter of 2008 because a commitment to sell the Canadian brokerage business was in place. The sale of the Canadian brokerage business was completed in the third quarter of 2008 for a gain of $268.8 million, net of tax. 2007 Compared to 2006 Income (loss) from continuing operations was a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to income of $626.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. These losses in our institutional segment more than offset the increase in our retail segment income, which increased $91.3 million to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Revenue Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income increased 14% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in enterprise interest earning assets. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 25% to $56.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Average loans, net grew 39% to $30.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of our focus on growing the one to four family loan portfolio in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 26% to $53.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily in retail deposits. Average retail deposits increased 30% to $26.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Increases in average retail deposits were driven by growth in the Complete Savings Account. 37 Table of Contents Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 21 basis points to 2.64% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of a challenging interest rate environment throughout 2007 as well as growth in our Complete Savings Account, which pays a higher interest rate than the majority of our other deposit products. Commission Commission revenue increased 11% to $663.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, which was driven by an increase of $61.8 million, or 13%, in our retail commission revenue. DARTs increased 16% to 177,900 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Our U.S. DART volume increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Our international DARTs grew by 42% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option related DARTs further increased as a percentage of total U.S. DARTs and represented 16% of trading volume versus 13% in 2006. Average commission per trade decreased 2% to $11.72 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation and win back campaigns, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges increased 5% to $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was due to an increase in order flow payment, advisor management fees, foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees and mortgage servicing fees. Principal Transactions Principal transactions decreased 7% to $102.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes. Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net was a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a gain of $21.2 million for the same period in 2006. The decline in the total gain (loss) on loans and securities, net during 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 36% to $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in other revenue was due to income from the cash surrender value of BOLI, an increase in fees earned in connection with distribution of shares during initial public offerings and software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio in the second half of 2007. 38 Table of Contents Operating Expense Operating expense increased 19% to $1.6 billion for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by increases in clearing and servicing, advertising and market development, impairment of goodwill and other expense. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 1% to $434.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The slight increase resulted primarily from increased benefit costs offset slightly by lower incentive based compensation in the current year. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense increased 11% to $270.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase is due primarily to higher loan balances during the period, which resulted in higher servicing costs, and increased trading activity, which resulted in higher clearing expenses. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 31% to $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This planned increase is a result of expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. Impairment of Goodwill Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of this expense was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and was driven primarily by the shut down of the international portion of our institutional brokerage business. Other Other expense increased 51% to $195.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 is due primarily to higher expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and higher FDIC premiums. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased 71% to $123.1 million for 2007 compared to 2006. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of corporate interest expense which increased 13% to $172.5 million, compared to 2006. The interest expense was partially offset by the sale of our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in Softbank Investment Corporation and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. resulting in gains of $71.7 million. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $732.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to an income tax expense of $305.4 million for the same period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for 39 Table of Contents 2007 was (33.7)% compared to 32.8% for 2006. For additional information, see Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. Discontinued Operations Our income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2006. During 2007 and 2006, discontinued operations included operating results from our Canadian brokerage business and our direct retail lending business. During 2006, discontinued operations also included the results from our professional agency business, E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC. SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW Retail The following table summarizes retail financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 2006 Amount % Retail segment income: Net operating interest income $ 829,707 $ 962,557 $ 870,462 $ (132,850 ) (14 )% Commission 514,736 520,216 458,463 (5,480 ) (1 )% Fees and service charges 200,726 218,682 202,037 (17,956 ) (8 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (78 ) 180 3,414 (258 ) * Other revenue 38,463 40,653 35,357 (2,190 ) (5 )% Net segment revenue 1,583,554 1,742,288 1,569,733 (158,734 ) (9 )% Total segment expense 975,488 947,864 866,568 27,624 3 % Total retail segment income $ 608,066 $ 794,424 $ 703,165 $ (186,358 ) (23 )% Key Metrics(1): Retail customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 112.2 $ 185.0 $ 191.3 $ (72.8 ) (39 )% Net new customer assets (dollars in billions)(2) $ 5.4 $ (11.3 ) $ 3.2 $ 16.7 * Customer cash and deposits (dollars in billions) $ 32.3 $ 32.7 $ 33.0 $ (0.4 ) (1 )% DARTs 188,116 177,900 153,146 10,216 6 % Average commission per trade $ 10.88 $ 11.72 $ 11.97 $ (0.84 ) (7 )% End of period margin debt (dollars in billions) $ 2.8 $ 7.0 $ 6.8 $ (4.2 ) (60 )% End of period total accounts 4,533,034 4,287,240 4,002,496 245,794 6 % * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Metrics have been represented to exclude activity from discontinued operations. All discussions, unless otherwise noted, are based on metrics from continuing operations. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2008, net new customer assets were $6.4 billion excluding the sale of RAA. Our retail segment generates revenue from brokerage and banking relationships with retail customers. These relationships essentially drive five sources of revenue: net operating interest income; commission; fees and service charges; gain (loss) on loans and securities, net; and other revenue. Other revenue includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we ultimately service retail customers through these corporate relationships. 2008 Compared to 2007 During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base which caused a decline in the core drivers of our retail segment, including: net new accounts, customer cash and deposits, DARTs, 40 Table of Contents margin debt and retail customer assets. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we anticipate credit related losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized. During the year ended December 31, 2008, our retail customer base showed positive growth trends, including adding almost 246,000 net new accounts and growth in net new customer assets of approximately $5.4 billion ($6.4 billion excluding the sale of RAA). We believe these are indications that our retail segment has not only stabilized but has returned to modest growth. Retail segment income decreased 23% to $608.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This was due primarily to a decrease in net operating interest income and an increase in total segment expense. Retail net operating interest income decreased 14% to $829.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in margin debt as well as the above market rate on our Complete Savings Account. We plan to reduce the rate on this product in future periods which we believe will result in an improvement to retail net operating interest income. Retail commission revenue decreased 1% to $514.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The slight decrease in commission revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in average commission per trade of 7%, offset by an increase in DARTs of 6%. Retail segment expense increased 3% to $975.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase related primarily to our planned growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 2.6 million active brokerage accounts, 1.0 million active stock plan accounts and 0.9 million active banking accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, our retail brokerage products contributed 67% for both years, and our banking products contributed 28% and 27%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 Retail segment income increased 13% to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in retail segment income during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 was due to an increase in net operating interest income and commission revenue, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Retail net operating interest income increased 11% to $962.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by customer cash and deposits, which generally translate into a lower cost of funds. The growth in customer cash and deposits during the first three quarters of 2007 was largely offset by the decline in customer cash during the fourth quarter of 2007. Retail commission revenue increased 13% to $520.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in commission revenue was primarily the result of increased trading volumes in the overall domestic equity market and in our international commissions. Retail segment expense increased 9% to $947.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related to our targeted growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 2.5 million active brokerage accounts, 1.1 million active stock plan accounts and 0.8 million active banking accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, our retail brokerage products contributed 67% and 69%, respectively, and our banking products contributed 27% and 25%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. 41 Table of Contents Institutional The following table summarizes institutional financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics): Year Ended December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 2006 Amount % Institutional segment income (loss): Net operating interest income $ 438,299 $ 621,042 $ 515,053 $ (182,743 ) (29 )% Commission 815 143,426 138,613 (142,611 ) (99 )% Fees and service charges 8,422 21,619 25,366 (13,197 ) (61 )% Principal transactions 84,882 102,180 110,136 (17,298 ) (17 )% Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net (195,405 ) (2,465,654 ) 17,786 2,270,249 (92 )% Other revenue 14,271 7,093 244 7,178 101 % Net segment revenue 351,284 (1,570,294 ) 807,198 1,921,578 * Provision for loan losses 1,583,666 640,078 44,970 943,588 147 % Total segment expense 323,969 636,237 461,078 (312,268 ) (49 )% Total institutional segment income (loss) $ (1,556,351 ) $ (2,846,609 ) $ 301,150 $ 1,290,258 (45 )% Key Metrics(1): Nonperforming loans as a % of gross loans receivable 3.69 % 1.37 % 0.28 % 2.32 % Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 1,080.6 $ 508.2 $ 67.6 $ 572.4 113 % Allowance for loan losses as a % of nonperforming loans 114.70 % 121.44 % 90.52 % (6.74 )% * Percentage not meaningful (1) Metrics have been represented to exclude activity from discontinued operations. All discussions, unless otherwise noted, are based on metrics from continuing operations. Our institutional segment generates revenue from balance sheet management activities and market making activities. Balance sheet management activities include managing loans previously purchased from the retail segment as well as third parties, and leveraging these loans and retail customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income. 2008 Compared to 2007 As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our institutional segment incurred a loss of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The loss was driven primarily by an increase in our provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Net operating interest income decreased 29% to $438.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to the decrease in average enterprise interest earning assets of 16% to $46.9 billion as of December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Institutional commission revenue decreased to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was a result of the exit of our institutional brokerage operations. Fees and service charges revenue decreased 61% to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in CDO management fees, which are no longer a revenue stream due to the sale of our collateral management agreements during the first quarter of 2008. 42 Table of Contents The total loss on loans and securities, net during year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to losses on our preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which experienced record price declines and volatility during the third quarter of 2008. Based upon our concerns about continuing market instability, all of our positions were liquidated during the third quarter of 2008, resulting in a pre tax loss of $153.8 million, net of hedges, that was recognized in loss on trading securities, net. In addition, we recognized $95.0 million of impairment on certain securities in our CMO portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods. Provision for loan losses increased $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio, which began in the second half of 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one to four family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008. Total institutional segment expense decreased 49% to $324.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was due primarily to the goodwill impairment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with our balance sheet management business. There was also a decline in our clearing expense related to the exit of our institutional brokerage operations, as well as a reduction in corporate overhead expenses, the majority of which are allocated to the institutional segment. 2007 Compared to 2006 As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our institutional segment incurred a loss of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The loss was driven primarily by losses in our asset backed securities portfolio of approximately $2.5 billion as well as provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net operating interest income increased 21% to $621.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in average interest earning assets of 25% to $56.1 as of December 31, 2007. Institutional commission revenue increased 3% to $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due to higher trading volumes as a result of volatility in global equity markets. Fees and service charges revenue decreased 15% to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is related to a $4.5 million decline in service fee income as a result of lower rates and lower home equity, credit card and CDO management fees. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was largely due to the deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio. 43 Table of Contents Total institutional segment expense increased 38% to $636.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 and was due primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with the decline in fair value of our balance sheet management business during the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase was also driven by the expenses associated with certain legal and regulatory matters. BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Assets: Cash(1) $ 4,995,447 $ 2,113,075 $ 2,882,372 136 % Trading securities 55,481 130,018 (74,537 ) (57 )% Available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 10,806,094 11,255,048 (448,954 ) (4 )% Margin receivables 2,791,168 7,179,175 (4,388,007 ) (61 )% Loans, net 24,451,852 30,139,382 (5,687,530 ) (19 )% Investment in FHLB stock 200,892 338,585 (137,693 ) (41 )% Other assets(2) 5,237,281 5,690,654 (453,373 ) (8 )% Total assets $ 48,538,215 $ 56,845,937 $ (8,307,722 ) (15 )% Liabilities and shareholders equity: Deposits $ 26,136,246 $ 25,884,755 $ 251,491 1 % Wholesale borrowings(3) 11,735,056 16,379,197 (4,644,141 ) (28 )% Customer payables 3,753,332 5,514,675 (1,761,343 ) (32 )% Corporate debt 2,750,532 3,022,698 (272,166 ) (9 )% Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities 1,571,553 3,215,547 (1,643,994 ) (51 )% Total liabilities 45,946,719 54,016,872 (8,070,153 ) (15 )% Shareholders equity 2,591,496 2,829,065 (237,569 ) (8 )% Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 48,538,215 $ 56,845,937 $ (8,307,722 ) (15 )% (1) Includes balance sheet line items cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations. (2) Includes balance sheet line items property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets. (3) Includes balance sheet line items securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. The decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of $5.7 billion in loans, net and a decrease of $4.4 billion in margin receivables for the period ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash of $2.9 billion. The decrease in loans, net is due to our strategy of reducing balance sheet risk and halting our previous focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. During this period, we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on strengthening our capital position. We believe the decrease in our margin receivables is due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure due to the volatility in the financial markets and is not due to a specific issue with the terms or competitiveness of our margin product. The decrease in total liabilities was attributable primarily to a decrease of $4.6 billion in wholesale borrowings, a decrease in customer payables of $1.8 billion and a decrease of $1.6 billion in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities for the period ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Repurchase agreements 44 Table of Contents and other borrowings are the primary wholesale funding sources for our loans, net and available for sale securities portfolios. The decreases in these balances were the result of paying down these liabilities as we decreased the size of our balance sheet during 2008. The decrease in our customer payables is related primarily to the sale of our Canadian brokerage business during the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, stock loan, which is reported within the accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities line item, decreased $1.7 billion to $0.3 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Available for Sale Mortgage Backed and Investment Securities Available for sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Mortgage backed securities: Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies $ 10,110,813 $ 9,330,129 $ 780,684 8 % Collateralized mortgage obligations and other 602,376 1,123,255 (520,879 ) (46 )% Total mortgage backed securities 10,713,189 10,453,384 259,805 2 % Investment securities: Municipal bonds 79,606 314,348 (234,742 ) (75 )% Publicly traded equity securities: Preferred stock(1) 371,404 (371,404 ) * Corporate investments 498 1,271 (773 ) (61 )% Other 12,801 114,641 (101,840 ) (89 )% Total investment securities 92,905 801,664 (708,759 ) (88 )% Total available for sale securities $ 10,806,094 $ 11,255,048 $ (448,954 ) (4 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) On January 1, 2008, the Company elected the fair value option for preferred stock in accordance with SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). As a result of this election, preferred stock was classified on the balance sheet as trading securities during 2008; however, during the third quarter of 2008, all preferred stock positions were sold. Available for sale securities represented 22% and 20% of total assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Available for sale securities decreased 4% to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, due primarily to the sale of certain mortgage backed securities in the first half of 2008, offset by the purchase of highly rated securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies in the second half of 2008. All mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are AAA rated. 45 Table of Contents Margin Receivables The margin receivables balance is a component of the margin debt balance, which is reported as a key retail metric of $2.8 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total margin debt balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Margin receivables $ 2,791,168 $ 7,179,175 $ (4,388,007 ) (61 )% Margin held by third parties and other 20,676 81,669 (60,993 ) (75 )% Margin held by the Canadian brokerage business(1) (274,180 ) 274,180 * Margin debt $ 2,811,844 $ 6,986,664 $ (4,174,820 ) (60 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) Margin held by the Canadian brokerage business prior to its sale was excluded as it is part of discontinued operations. We believe the decrease in our margin receivables is due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure given the substantial volatility in the financial markets and is not due to an issue with the terms or competitiveness of our margin product. Loans, Net Loans, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Loans held for sale $ $ 100,539 $ (100,539 ) * One to four family 12,979,844 15,506,529 (2,526,685 ) (16 )% Home equity 10,017,183 11,901,324 (1,884,141 ) (16 )% Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 1,570,116 1,910,454 (340,338 ) (18 )% Marine 424,595 526,580 (101,985 ) (19 )% Commercial 214,084 272,156 (58,072 ) (21 )% Credit card 85,851 90,764 (4,913 ) (5 )% Other 4,024 23,334 (19,310 ) (83 )% Unamortized premiums, net 236,766 315,866 (79,100 ) (25 )% Allowance for loan losses (1,080,611 ) (508,164 ) (572,447 ) 113 % Total loans, net $ 24,451,852 $ 30,139,382 $ (5,687,530 ) (19 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Loans, net decreased 19% to $24.5 billion at December 31, 2008 from $30.1 billion at December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to our strategy of reducing balance sheet risk and halting our previous focus on growing the balance sheet. We do not expect to grow our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. In 2007, we entered into a credit default swap (CDS) on $4.0 billion of our first lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. As of December 31, 2008, the balance of the loans 46 Table of Contents covered by the CDS was $2.9 billion. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS provides protection for losses in excess of $4.0 million, but not to exceed approximately $30.3 million. In addition, our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $1.6 million in losses on the portion of the loans covered under the CDS. We have not yet realized any recoveries from the CDS; however, the estimated recoveries from the CDS for the next twelve months were $13.9 million at December 31, 2008, which is reflected in the allowance for loan losses. Deposits Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Money market and savings accounts $ 12,692,729 $ 10,028,115 $ 2,664,614 27 % Sweep deposit accounts 9,650,431 10,112,123 (461,692 ) (5 )% Certificates of deposit 2,363,385 4,156,674 (1,793,289 ) (43 )% Checking accounts 991,477 495,618 495,859 100 % Brokered certificates of deposit 438,224 1,092,225 (654,001 ) (60 )% Total deposits $ 26,136,246 $ 25,884,755 $ 251,491 1 % Deposits represented 57% and 48% of total liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Deposits increased $0.3 billion to $26.1 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, driven by a $2.7 billion increase in money market and savings accounts. This increase was offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposits by $2.4 billion. Deposits generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives. The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $32.3 billion and $32.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The decrease in other borrowings of $3.1 billion for the period ended December 31, 2008 was due primarily to a decrease in FHLB advances. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. As a result, we expect these balances to fluctuate over time as our deposits and our interest earning assets fluctuate. Corporate Debt Corporate debt is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 Amount % Senior notes $ 1,144,662 $ 1,272,742 $ (128,080 ) (10 )% Springing lien notes 1,605,870 1,304,391 301,479 23 % Mandatory convertible notes 445,565 (445,565 ) * Total corporate debt $ 2,750,532 $ 3,022,698 $ (272,166 ) (9 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Corporate debt decreased to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily due to the retirement of the $450 million in mandatory convertible notes during the fourth quarter of 2008 and a decline in senior notes of $121 million in principal related to debt for equity exchanges. Offsetting these decreases was an additional $150.0 million of 12 1/2% springing lien notes issued to Citadel in the first quarter of 2008 and the issuance of $121 million of 12 1/2% springing lien notes in satisfaction of the November 2008 interest payment on these notes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have established liquidity and capital policies. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle. These policies are especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets, which have been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2007 and will likely continue for the foreseeable future. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. We believe this disruption was due to uncertainty in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. Deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and 48 Table of Contents contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans. While the liquidity risk associated with our customer deposits remains at historically high levels, we believe the current level of risk is substantially lower than it was during the fourth quarter of 2007. Capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities. During the second half of 2007, our institutional segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Consequently, this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company raised $2.5 billion in cash from Citadel, the majority of which was used to provide capital to the institutional segment. While this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our retail segment remains profitable and continues to generate capital through retained earnings. We maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimums at our regulated subsidiaries, the most significant of which is E*TRADE Bank. As of December 31, 2008, we held $714.7 million of risk based capital at E*TRADE Bank in excess of the regulatory minimum level required to be considered well capitalized. We raised additional capital in 2008 by issuing shares of common stock in exchange for existing corporate debt, primarily our senior notes, commonly referred to as 3(a)9 exchanges. We completed several 3(a)9 exchanges in the first half of 2008, which resulted in a retirement of $120.8 million of existing corporate debt. We did not complete any of these transactions during the second half of 2008 as the relative prices of our common stock and corporate debt made it unattractive to do so. In addition, we raised approximately $750 million in cash through non core asset sales, including the sale of our Canadian brokerage business and our equity shares in Investsmart(1). We believe the combination of the capital generated in the transactions detailed above, the excess capital held at E*TRADE Bank and the capital that continues to be generated in our retail segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we applied to the U.S. Treasury for funding under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. Our application remains under active consideration and we cannot predict when a final decision will be reached. We estimate this program could provide up to approximately $800 million in new preferred equity, at rates substantially discounted to current market rates. If our application is approved, it would likely be conditional upon additional capital raising activities by us, including possible transactions with existing security holders. Our ability to issue preferred equity under the TARP program would be dependent upon receiving approval from certain of our bond holders and possibly our shareholders. While we do not believe we need this capital to fund our operations, it does have the potential to significantly improve the capital position of both E*TRADE Bank and the parent company, which would enhance our ability to maintain the balance sheet at its current level. (1) The equity shares of Investsmart were sold by our wholly owned subsidiary, E*TRADE Mauritius. 49 Table of Contents Corporate Cash Corporate cash is the primary source of liquidity at the parent company and is available to invest in our regulated subsidiaries. We define corporate cash as cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval. The components of corporate cash as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Parent company cash $ 216,535 $ 251,663 $ (35,128 ) Converging Arrows, Inc. and other cash(1) 218,318 60,701 157,617 Total corporate cash(2) $ 434,853 $ 312,364 $ 122,489 (1) Converging Arrows, Inc. and other consists of corporate subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval and includes E*TRADE Mauritius.

Parent company cash decreased $35.1 million to $216.5 million as of December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007. The cash received from the sale of the Canadian brokerage business was offset by the $500 million in capital infusions made to E*TRADE Bank during the second half of 2008. The $157.6 million increase in cash to $218.3 million at Converging Arrows, Inc. and other as of December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007 was due almost entirely to the sale of E*TRADE Mauritius equity shares in Investsmart. Cash and Equivalents The consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased by $2.1 billion to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The majority of this balance is cash held in regulated subsidiaries, primarily our Bank and Brokerage, outlined as follows: December 31, Variance 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Corporate cash $ 434,853 $ 312,364 $ 122,489 Bank subsidiaries 3,220,232 691,826 2,528,406 Brokerage subsidiaries 339,716 768,677 (428,961 ) Other corporate cash 5,356 5,377 (21 ) Less: Cash reported in Other assets(1) (146,308 ) (146,308 ) Total consolidated cash $ 3,853,849 $ 1,778,244 $ 2,075,605 (1) Cash reported in other assets at December 31, 2008 consists of cash that we invested in The Reserve Funds Primary Fund and is included as a receivable in the other assets line item, as The Reserve Fund has not indicated when the funds will be distributed back to investors. The cash held in our regulated subsidiaries serves as a source of liquidity for those subsidiaries and is not a primary source of capital for the parent company. Cash and Equivalents Held in the Reserve Fund At December 31, 2008, we held cash in The Reserve Funds Primary Fund (the Fund) of $146.3 million, which is included as a receivable in other assets line item on the balance sheet. On September 16, 2008, the Fund reported that its shares had fallen below the standard of $1 per share, which is commonly referred to as breaking the buck. Prior to the fund breaking the buck, we submitted a redemption request for our entire balance in the 50 Table of Contents fund. The following table details our cash held in the Fund at the date the Fund was reported as breaking the buck and at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Variance December 31,2008 September 15,2008 December 31, 2008 vs.September 15, 2008 Corporate cash $ 45,273 $ 230,326 $ (185,053 ) Bank subsidiaries 82,645 420,456 (337,811 ) Brokerage subsidiaries 18,390 93,559 (75,169 ) Total cash held in the Fund $ 146,308 $ 744,341 $ (598,033 ) On October 31, 2008 and December 3, 2008, the Fund made a distribution to its investors of approximately $26 billion and $14 billion, respectively. We received $377.7 million and $209.2 million, respectively, in connection with these distributions. On December 3, 2008, the Reserve indicated that they are required to distribute the remaining assets of the Fund ratably among the holders of outstanding shares, irrespective of whether the investor made a redemption request before or after the Fund breaking the buck. The statement indicated, assuming a pro rata distribution, the net asset value per share would be $0.985. As a result of that statement, we no longer believe it is probable that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position in the Fund; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $11.2 million(1) related to this investment. The impairment charge of $3.5 million related to our corporate cash was included in gain (loss) on sales of investments, net line item. The impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our banking and brokerage subsidiaries is included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item. The remaining amount of $146.3 million, net of the $11.2 million impairment charge, that we invested in the Fund is included as a receivable in the other assets line item. On February 26, 2009, the Reserve announced that it had adopted a Plan of Liquidation for the orderly liquidation of the assets of the Fund. Under the terms of the plan, which is subject to the supervision of the SEC, the Reserve will continue to make interim distributions up to $0.9172 per share. The Reserve indicated in this announcement that they were taking this approach in order to provide liquidity to investors without prejudicing the legal rights and remedies of any shareholders claims. This announcement does not change our belief that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position upon the ultimate distribution of the fund; however, we cannot state with certainty that we will not ultimately incur additional loss on our remaining position. In addition, we believe it will take a significant amount of time to eventually receive these funds. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, Inc. (Converging Arrows) and E*TRADE Mauritius, a wholly owned subsidiary of Converging Arrows, is limited by regulatory requirements. Any loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and its other non bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arms length, collateralization and other requirements. At December 31, 2008, E*TRADE Bank had approximately $714.7 million of risk based capital above the well capitalized level. In the current credit environment, we plan to keep this significant amount of excess risk based capital at E*TRADE Bank in order to enhance our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining well capitalized status. However, events beyond managements control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Banks ability to meet its future capital requirements. The Companys broker/dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, all of our brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $717.6(2) million at December 31, 2008. While we cannot assure that we would obtain regulatory approval to withdraw any of this excess net capital, $619.4 million is available for dividend while still maintaining a capital level above regulatory early warning guidelines. (1) The impairment charge was calculated based on the Companys investment balance as of September 15, 2008 (the day the Fund broke the buck), which totaled $744.3 million. (2) The excess net capital of the broker dealer subsidiaries included $620.7 million of excess net capital at E*TRADE Clearing, which is a subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank and is also included in the excess risk based capital of E*TRADE Bank. 51 Table of Contents Other Sources of Liquidity We also maintain $325.0 million in uncommitted financing to meet margin lending needs. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding balances, and the full $325.0 million was available. We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity for the Bank. Our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market. At December 31, 2008, the Bank had approximately $9.8 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB. We have the option to make interest payments on our springing lien notes in the form of either cash or additional springing lien notes through May 2010. During the second quarter of 2008, we elected to make our first interest payment of approximately $121 million in cash. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we elected to make our second interest payment of $121 million in the form of additional springing lien notes. We expect to make our next three interest payments, which equates to all interest payments on the springing lien notes through May 2010 in the form of additional springing lien notes. The November 2010 payment is the first interest payment we are required to pay in cash. Corporate Debt Our current senior debt ratings are B2 by Moodys Investor Service, B (developing) by S&P and B (high) by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS). The Companys long term deposit ratings are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service, BB (developing) by S&P and BB by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 years Thereafter Total Certificates of deposit and brokered certificate of deposit (1)(2) $ 2,231,375 $ 383,955 $ 108,450 $ 189,624 $ 2,913,404 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase(2) 4,780,262 1,422,058 274,437 1,174,948 7,651,705 Other borrowings(2)(3) 2,020,693 377,537 645,919 2,407,125 5,451,274 Corporate debt(4) 341,698 1,100,039 1,019,459 3,343,954 5,805,150 Operating lease payments(5) 35,108 52,498 30,332 47,458 165,396 Purchase Obligations(6) 71,317 20,287 4,429 1,889 97,922 FIN 48 liabilities 5,036 15,500 4,122 45,916 70,574 Total contractual obligations $ 9,485,489 $ 3,371,874 $ 2,087,148 $ 7,210,914 $ 22,155,425 (1) Does not include sweep deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts or checking accounts as there are no maturities and /or scheduled contractual payments. (2) Includes annual interest based on the contractual features of each transaction, using market rates at December 31, 2008. Interest rates are assumed to remain at current levels over the life of all adjustable rate instruments. (3) For mandatorily redeemable preferred securities included in other borrowings, does not assume early redemption under current conversion provisions. (4) Includes annual interest payments; does not assume early redemption under current call provisions. See Note 15 Corporate Debt for further details.

(6) Includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by non cancelable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees. Excluded from the table are purchase obligations expected to be settled in cash within one year of the end of the reporting period. 52 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.5 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under home equity lines of credit and $0.5 billion of unused credit card and commercial lines. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no commitments to originate, purchase or sell loans. The Company had a commitment to purchase and sell securities of $0.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The Company also had equity funding commitments of $9.7 million as of December 31, 2008, based on investment plans of venture capital funds, low income housing tax credit partnerships and joint ventures. Additional information related to commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23 Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters. Other Liquidity Matters We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support regulatory capital needs at our Bank, reduce holding company debt, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. RISK MANAGEMENT As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. The identification and management of existing and potential risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management framework, principles and practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. Risks cannot be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Companys risk tolerance. Our businesses expose us to the following four major categories of risk that often overlap: Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in the ability or willingness of a borrower or counterparty to meet the agreed upon terms of their financial obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability to meet current and future cash flow and collateral needs. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates, which could cause fluctuations in our long term earnings or in the value of the Companys net assets. Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal controls process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. We also are subject to other risks that could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. A variety of methodologies and measures are used to monitor, quantify, assess and forecast risk. Measurement criteria, methodologies and calculations are reviewed periodically to assure that risks are represented appropriately. Risks are managed and controlled under policies and related limits that are approved by the Board of Directors and delegated to senior management. The Finance and Risk Oversight Committee, which was established in the second quarter of 2008 and consists of members of the Board of Directors, monitors the risk process and significant risks throughout the 53 Table of Contents Company. In addition to this committee, various enterprise risk committees and departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks, including: Asset Liability Committee E*TRADE Banks Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) has primary responsibility for managing liquidity risk and interest rate risk and reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. Credit Risk Committee The Credit Risk Committee monitors asset quality trends, evaluates market conditions, determines the adequacy for allowance of loan losses, establishes underwriting standards, approves large credit exposures, approves large portfolio purchases and delegates credit approval authority. We use various departments throughout the Company to aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and enterprise risk management. Risk reporting occurs at the business or operating units and is aggregated across the Company through the enterprise risk management process. Credit Risk Management Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where it results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks. Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate. Housing Market Conditions Conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets, which deteriorated sharply during 2007, continued to be extremely challenging during 2008. The significant and abrupt evaporation of secondary market liquidity for various types of mortgage loans, particularly home equity loans, has decreased the overall availability of housing credit. As a result, many borrowers, particularly those in markets with declining housing prices, have been unable to refinance existing loans. This combination of a decline in the availability of credit and a decline in housing prices creates significant credit risk in our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio. Loss Mitigation Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio. This teams primary focus is reducing our exposure to open home equity lines. As of December 31, 2007, we had $6.3 billion of unused lines of credit available under home equity lines of credit. Through a variety of strategies, including voluntary line closures, automatically freezing lines on all delinquent accounts, and freezing lines on loans with materially reduced home equity, we have reduced this amount to $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2008. The team has several other initiatives either in progress or in development which are focused on mitigating losses in our home equity loan portfolio. Those initiatives include improving collection efforts and practices of our servicers as well as increasing our loss recovery efforts to minimize the level of loss on a loan that goes to charge off. 54 Table of Contents We also initiated a loan modification program that resulted in an insignificant number of minor modifications in 2008. Based on the programs we now have in place, we expect the number of modifications to increase significantly in 2009 when compared to 2008. On February 18, 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. The primary focus of this plan is to create requirements and provide incentives to modify mortgages with the goal of avoiding foreclosure. We are analyzing the details of this recently announced program and do not yet know whether it would have a significant impact on our current loan modification programs. In addition, we continue to review our purchased mortgage loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. Our review is primarily focused on identifying loans with early payment defaults, violations of transaction representations and warranties, or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $105.6 million of loans were repurchased by the original sellers. Underwriting Standards Originated Loans During the second half of 2007, we exited our wholesale mortgage origination channel and no longer originate loans through brokers. During the second quarter of 2008, we exited our retail mortgage origination business, which represented our last remaining loan origination channel. We did not originate any loans during the second half of 2008. Prior to the exit of our retail mortgage origination business in the second quarter of 2008, we did originate approximately $158 million in one to four family loans during the first half of 2008. These loans were predominantly prime credit quality first lien mortgage loans secured by a single family residence. We priced our loans primarily based on the risk elements inherent in the loan. We evaluated criteria such as, but not limited to: borrower credit score, loan to value ratio (LTV), documentation type, occupancy type and other risk elements. In the first quarter of 2008, we further adjusted our loan origination practices and pricing to significantly curtail originations of higher risk loans, particularly home equity loans with Fair Isaac Credit Organization (FICO) scores below 700 or a combined loan to value ratio (CLTV) greater than 80%. Our underwriting guidelines were established with a focus on both the credit quality of the borrower as well as the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan. We designed our underwriting guidelines so that our one to four family loans were salable in the secondary market. These guidelines included limitations on loan amount, LTV ratio, debt to income ratio, documentation type and occupancy type. We also required borrowers to obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan to value first lien mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2008, we did not offer any mortgage loan products to our customers. In the future, we expect to partner with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. Underwriting Standards Purchased Loans In the second half of 2007, we altered our business strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. As a result, we did not purchase loans during the year ended December 31, 2008 and we do not anticipate purchasing a significant amount of loans for the foreseeable future. However, we have significantly tightened our underwriting policies for any future loan purchases that do occur. These criteria focus on limiting the acquisition of loans with a high risk of credit loss and require the exclusion of loans with the following attributes: second lien; home equity line of credit; CLTV ratio above 80%; FICO score below 700 at time of origination; and documentation type is not full documentation. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is monitored and managed primarily by the ALCO. We have in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain our flexibility to address liquidity events specific to us or the market in general. We believe liquidity risk management is especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. These deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of our liquidity policies and contingency plans. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the ALCO. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks. Operational Risk Management Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from clearing to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof. Loss of company and customer assets due to fraud represents one of our most significant operational risks. Fraud losses typically result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and use scoring tools which prevent a significant number of fraudulent transactions on a daily basis. However, new techniques and strategies are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. In order to minimize this threat, we offer our customers various security measures, including a token based security system. This token creates a unique password which changes every sixty seconds and must be used along with the customers self selected password to access their account. We believe this system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customers account. The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial loss and impact our reputation. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships and arrangements. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conduct financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers. Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from human error, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in actual losses could be due to Internet performance issues, litigation, change in public policy and our reputation. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Loans We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors, which are documented at the time of 56 Table of Contents origination, include: borrowers debt to income ratio, borrowers credit scores, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type, and loan type. We also review estimated current LTV ratios when monitoring credit risk in our loan portfolios. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, LTV ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In the current housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the LTV ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk. We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably ended up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub prime loans. As of December 31, 2008, sub prime(1) real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans. As noted above, we believe loan type, LTV ratios and borrowers credit scores are key determinants of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans(2) on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a CLTV of 90% or higher or a FICO score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios. The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV and FICO score of our two main loan portfolios, one to four family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands)(3): One toFour Family Home Equity LTV/CLTV at Origination(4) December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 &lt; 70% $ 5,647,650 $ 6,666,212 $ 3,126,274 $ 3,628,619 70% 80% 7,008,860 8,450,977 1,822,797 2,086,277 80% 90% 162,966 202,133 3,312,332 3,871,249 &gt;90% 160,368 187,207 1,755,780 2,315,179 Total $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination(5) 68.8 % 79.1 % Average estimated current LTV/CLTV(6) 90.1 % 99.7 % One toFour Family Home Equity FICO at Origination December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 &gt; 720 $ 8,680,892 $ 10,373,807 $ 6,005,837 $ 6,992,793 719 700 1,750,294 2,089,014 1,591,380 1,898,924 699 680 1,342,967 1,585,613 1,379,218 1,668,427 679 660 784,449 943,538 595,776 757,016 659 620 412,514 503,573 432,862 566,030 &lt;620 8,728 10,984 12,110 18,134 Total $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 (1) Defined as borrowers with FICO scores less than 620 at the time of origination. (2) Approximately 14% of the home equity portfolio is in the first lien position. For home equity loans that are in a second lien position, we also hold the first lien position on the same residential real estate property for less than 1% of the loans in this portfolio. (3) Average estimated current LTV/CLTV at December 31, 2007 is not shown as the data is not readily available. (4) CLTV at origination calculations for home equity are based on drawn balances. (5) Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination calculations for home equity are based on undrawn balances. (6) The average estimated current LTV ratio reflects the outstanding balance at the balance sheet date, divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated using the most recent property value data available to us. For properties in which we did not have an updated valuation, we utilized home price indices to estimate the current property value. 57 Table of Contents In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): One toFour Family Home Equity Acquisition Channel December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Purchased from a third party $ 10,646,324 $ 12,904,759 $ 8,873,156 $ 10,638,021 Originated by the Company 2,333,520 2,601,770 1,144,027 1,263,303 Total real estate loans $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 One toFour Family Home Equity Vintage Year December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 2003 and prior $ 577,408 $ 844,670 $ 754,054 $ 901,240 2004 1,309,985 1,669,492 990,138 1,156,867 2005 2,695,718 3,084,336 2,426,000 2,790,423 2006 4,890,407 5,829,146 4,668,721 5,760,906 2007 3,475,661 4,078,885 1,161,667 1,291,888 2008 30,665 16,603 Total real estate loans $ 12,979,844 $ 15,506,529 $ 10,017,183 $ 11,901,324 Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2008 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands): One to Four Family Home Equity Consumer and Other Total Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) Allowance Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1) December 31, 2008 $ 185,163 1.42 % $ 833,835 8.19 % $ 61,613 2.65 % $ 1,080,611 4.23 % December 31, 2007 $ 18,831 0.12 % $ 459,167 3.79 % $ 30,166 1.05 % $ 508,164 1.66 % (1) Allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category. 58 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008, the allowance for loan losses increased by $572.4 million from the level at December 31, 2007. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during the second half of 2007. During the year ended December, 31 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one to four family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008. The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge offs for the past five years (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Allowance for loan losses, beginning of period $ 508,164 $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 $ 37,847 Provision for loan losses 1,583,666 640,078 44,970 54,016 38,121 Allowance acquired through acquisitions(1) 1,547 Charge offs: One to four family (137,974 ) (5,661 ) (616 ) (936 ) (186 ) Home equity (820,201 ) (168,163 ) (15,372 ) (3,929 ) (1,464 ) Recreational vehicle (59,396 ) (32,566 ) (25,253 ) (20,592 ) (18,419 ) Marine (14,278 ) (8,766 ) (6,463 ) (8,009 ) (6,003 ) Credit card (10,854 ) (11,608 ) (11,371 ) (17,286 ) (10,313 ) Other (312 ) (915 ) (2,768 ) (6,095 ) (13,956 ) Total charge offs (1,043,015 ) (227,679 ) (61,843 ) (56,847 ) (50,341 ) Recoveries: One to four family 455 476 167 234 Home equity 8,244 4,368 822 526 310 Recreational vehicle 16,371 15,771 11,959 7,848 9,088 Marine 4,849 4,591 4,091 3,960 3,225 Credit card 782 957 750 380 141 Other 1,095 1,974 3,426 5,488 7,743 Total recoveries 31,796 28,137 21,215 18,436 20,507 Net charge offs (1,011,219 ) (199,542 ) (40,628 ) (38,411 ) (29,834 ) Allowance for loan losses, end of period $ 1,080,611 $ 508,164 $ 67,628 $ 63,286 $ 47,681 Net charge offs to average loans receivable outstanding 3.64 % 0.65 % 0.18 % 0.26 % 0.30 % (1) Acquisition of credit card portfolio in 2004. 59 Table of Contents The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by loan category (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) Amount %(1) One to four family $ 185,163 51.3 % $ 18,831 51.3 % $ 7,760 41.7 % $ 4,858 37.0 % $ 2,812 32.3 % Home equity 833,835 39.6 459,167 39.4 31,671 45.3 26,049 42.3 15,183 31.9 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 36,896 6.2 12,622 6.3 11,077 8.8 13,465 14.1 11,343 22.4 Marine 8,339 1.7 4,171 1.7 3,648 2.5 4,590 3.9 4,116 6.3 Commercial 4,063 0.9 2,407 0.9 1,635 0.9 669 0.5 22 Credit card 11,786 0.3 10,123 0.3 10,611 0.5 11,714 1.0 9,078 1.8 Other 529 0.0 843 0.1 1,226 0.3 1,941 1.2 5,127 5.3 Total consumer and other loans 61,613 9.1 30,166 9.3 28,197 13.0 32,379 20.7 29,686 35.8 Total allowance for loan losses $ 1,080,611 100.0 % $ 508,164 100.0 % $ 67,628 100.0 % $ 63,286 100.0 % $ 47,681 100.0 % (1) Represents percentage of loans receivable in category to total loans receivable, excluding premium (discount). Loan losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For credit cards, our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Our policy for one to four family loan charge offs prior to January 1, 2008 was to recognize a charge off when we foreclosed on the property. For home equity loans, our policy prior to January 1, 2008 was to charge off loans when we foreclosed on the property or when the loan had been delinquent for 180 days. As of January 1, 2008, we adjusted our charge off policy mainly for loans in the process of foreclosure. Our updated policy for both one to four family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. As a result of this change, nonperforming loans included a $73.5 million write down as of December 31, 2008. 60 Table of Contents Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 increased by $811.7 million. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge offs on home equity loans, which was driven mainly by the same factors as described above. The continued pressure in the residential real estate market, specifically home price depreciation combined with tighter mortgage lending guidelines, could lead to a higher level of charge offs in future periods. The following graph illustrates the net charge offs by quarter: Nonperforming Assets We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 One to four family $ 593,075 $ 181,315 $ 33,588 $ 17,393 $ 8,009 Home equity 341,255 229,523 32,216 9,568 2,755 Consumer and other loans: Recreational vehicle 2,353 2,235 2,579 2,826 1,416 Marine 1,248 1,130 1,439 873 908 Credit card 4,146 3,769 3,795 2,858 2,999 Other 45 470 1,093 462 848 Total consumer and other loans 7,792 7,604 8,906 7,019 6,171 Total nonperforming loans 942,122 418,442 74,710 33,980 16,935 Real estate owned (REO) and other repossessed assets, net 108,105 45,895 12,904 6,555 5,367 Total nonperforming assets, net $ 1,050,227 $ 464,337 $ 87,614 $ 40,535 $ 22,302 Nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable 3.69 % 1.37 % 0.28 % 0.17 % 0.15 % One to four family allowance for loan losses as a percentage of one to four family nonperforming loans receivable 31.22 % 10.39 % 23.10 % 27.93 % 35.11 % Home equity allowance for loan losses as a percentage of home equity nonperforming loans receivable 244.34 % 200.05 % 98.31 % 272.25 % 551.11 % Consumer and other allowance for loan losses as a percentage of consumer and other nonperforming loans receivable 790.72 % 396.71 % 316.61 % 461.31 % 481.06 % Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable 114.70 % 121.44 % 90.52 % 186.24 % 281.55 % 61 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008 our nonperforming assets, net increased $585.9 million to $1.1 billion. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one to four family loans of $411.8 million and home equity loans of $111.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007. We expect nonperforming loan levels to increase over time due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets. The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter: The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net decreased from 121% at December 31, 2007 to 115% at December 31, 2008. This decrease was driven primarily by an increase in one to four family non performing loans, which have a significantly lower level of expected loss when compared to home equity loans. The balance of nonperforming loans includes loans delinquent 90 to 179 days as well as loans delinquent 180 days and greater. We believe the distinction between these two periods is important as loans delinquent 180 days and greater have been written down to their expected recovery value, whereas loans delinquent 90 to 179 days have not. We believe the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days is an important measure of the adequacy of the allowance as these loans are expected to drive the vast majority of future charge offs. Additional charge offs on loans delinquent 180 days are possible if home prices decline beyond our current expectations, but we do not anticipate these charge offs to be significant, particularly when compared to the expected charge offs on loans delinquent 90 to 179 days. We consider this ratio especially important for one to four family loans as we expect the balances of loans delinquent 180 days and greater to increase in the future due to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market. The following table shows the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days for each of our major loan categories (dollars in thousands): December 31,2008 Allowance as a % of LoansDelinquent 90 to 179 days One to four family loans $ 272,869 67.86 % Home equity loans 278,867 299.01 % Consumer and other loans 6,764 910.90 % Total loans delinquent 90 to 179 days $ 558,500 193.48 % 62 Table of Contents In addition to nonperforming assets, we monitor loans where a borrowers past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan (Special Mention loans). We classify loans as Special Mention when they are between 30 and 89 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for Special Mention loans (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 One to four family $ 594,379 $ 296,764 Home equity 407,386 291,675 Consumer and other loans 33,298 23,800 Total Special Mention loans $ 1,035,063 $ 612,239 Special Mention loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable 4.05 % 2.00 % The trend in Special Mention loan balances is generally indicative of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods, as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off. One to four family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan. Our home equity loans are generally secured by real estate assets; however, the majority of these loans are secured in a second lien position, which substantially increases the potential loss when compared to a first lien position. During 2008, Special Mention loans increased by $422.8 million to approximately $1.0 billion. While our level of Special Mention loans can fluctuate significantly in any given period, we do not believe the overall increase we observed in 2008 will be repeated in 2009. The following graph illustrates the Special Mention loans by quarter: Securities We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe our asset backed securities portfolio, which we sold in the fourth quarter of 2007, represented our highest concentration of credit risk within the securities portfolio. Subsequent to the sale of that portfolio, we believe our 63 Table of Contents highest concentration of remaining credit risk, while considerably lower than the credit risk inherent in asset backed securities, is our CMO portfolio. The table below details the amortized cost by average credit ratings and type of asset as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2008 AAA AA A BBB BelowInvestmentGrade andNon Rated Total Mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies $ 10,118,792 $ $ $ $ $ 10,118,792 CMOs and other 625,066 67,988 64,795 18,493 173,051 949,393 Municipal bonds, corporate bonds and FHLB stock 231,492 11,932 83,515 326,939 Total $ 10,975,350 $ 79,920 $ 148,310 $ 18,493 $ 173,051 $ 11,395,124 December 31, 2007 AAA AA A BBB BelowInvestmentGrade andNon Rated Total Mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies $ 9,697,723 $ $ $ $ $ 9,697,723 CMOs and other 1,066,290 132,330 469 1,199,089 Asset backed securities 122 122 Municipal bonds, corporate bonds, preferred stock and FHLB stock 675,058 596,047 8,342 1,279,447 Total $ 11,439,071 $ 728,377 $ 8,811 $ $ 122 $ 12,176,381 While the vast majority of this portfolio is AAA rated, we concluded during the year ended December 31, 2008 that approximately $181.2 million of the securities in this portfolio had a probable risk of future loss. As a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities, they were written down to their estimated fair market value by recording a $95.0 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2008. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods. Derivatives Credit risk is an element of the recurring fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments. We monitor the collateral requirements on derivative instruments through credit support agreements, which reduce risk by permitting the netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. We considered the impact of credit risk on the fair value measurement for derivative instruments, particularly those in net liability positions, to be mitigated by the enforcement of credit support agreements, and the collateral requirements therein. Our credit risk analysis for derivative instruments also considered whether the cost to mitigate the credit loss exposure on derivative instruments in net asset positions would have resulted in material adjustments to the valuations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the consideration of credit risk, the Companys or the counterpartys, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments. 64 Table of Contents SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation. Allowance for Loan Losses Description The allowance for loan losses is managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, we perform periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and loss forecasting assumptions. At December 31, 2008, our allowance for loan losses was $1.1 billion on $25.3 billion of loans designated as held for investment. Judgments The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge off and loss experience; current industry charge off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by loan type: one to four family, home equity and consumer and other loan portfolios. Our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios are separated into risk segments based on key risk factors, which include but are not limited to channel of loan origination, documentation type, loan product type and LTV ratio. Based upon the segmentation, probable losses are determined with expected loss rates in each segment. The additional protection provided by mortgage insurance and the credit default swap has been factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. The expected recovery from the liquidation of foreclosed real estate and expected recoveries from loan sellers related to contractual guarantees are also factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. Our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios represented 51% and 40%, respectively, of the total gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. For the consumer and other loan portfolio, management establishes loss estimates for each consumer portfolio based on credit characteristics and observation of the existing markets. The expected recoveries from the sale of repossessed collateral are factored into the expected loss on defaulted consumer loans based on current liquidation experience. Our consumer and other loan portfolio represented 9% of the total gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Effects if Actual Results Differ The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and 65 Table of Contents judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. These losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank. Fair Value Measurements Description Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine the fair value of our financial instruments and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis in accordance with SFAS No. 157. We will not adopt certain provisions of this statement until January 1, 2009 as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Examples of assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 include reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets measured at fair value in impairment tests under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), nonfinancial long lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144) as well as nonfinancial liabilities for exit or disposal activities initially measured at fair value under SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). Judgments In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including market, income and or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The standard describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys transfers in and out of Level 3 are as of the beginning of the reporting period on a quarterly basis. Effects if Actual Results Differ As of December 31, 2008, 23% and 1% of our total assets and total liabilities, respectively, represented instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008 represented less than 1% of our total assets and total liabilities. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. 66 Table of Contents Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments Description We generally classify our investments in mortgage backed securities, debt securities and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held to maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other than temporary are included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net for our banking and brokerage investments and gain (loss) on sales of investments, net for our corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly traded and privately held companies, which we evaluate for other than temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $96.2 million, $168.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of losses from other than temporary declines in market value related to our investments. Judgments The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies include to be announced (TBA) securities and mortgage pass through certificates. The fair value of mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies is determined using quoted market prices, recent market transactions and spread data for similar instruments. Mortgage backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. CMOs, generally non agency mortgage backed securities, are typically valued using market observable data, when available, including recent external market transactions for similar instruments. We also utilized a pricing service to corroborate the market observability of our inputs used in the fair value measurements. The valuations of CMOs reflect our best estimate of what market participants would consider in pricing the financial instruments. We consider the price transparency for these financial instruments to be a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value. Due to the limited activity and low level of transparency around inputs to their valuation, a portion of these securities are classified as Level 3 even though we believe that Level 2 inputs could likely be obtainable in a more active market. We also make estimates about the timing for recognizing losses in the consolidated statement of income (loss) based on market conditions and other factors. Management uses judgment to estimate the future cash flows associated with each security held at a loss and to assess the probability of collecting those cash flows. Management uses a qualitative and quantitative risk approach to evaluate each security held at a loss, which includes assessing underlying collateral characteristics to determine if there has been an adverse change in the amount or timing of the estimated future cash flows, which would indicate other than temporary impairment. The Company recognizes an impairment charge by writing the amortized cost basis of the security down to its fair market value when the Company believes that there has been a probable adverse change in the estimated future cash flows of the security. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date. Effects if Actual Results Differ In general, level classification transfers in and out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2008 were driven by changes in price transparency in the CMO market throughout the year. Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2008 include $3.9 million of CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008. While the Companys fair value estimates of Level 3 instruments as of December 31, 2008 utilized observable inputs where available, the valuation included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of 67 Table of Contents market information considered and the financial instruments were therefore classified as Level 3. The Company recorded a $118.8 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 on CMOs classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. The Company recorded a $1.0 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008 and Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. Of the $95.0 million impairment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the CMO portfolio, $93.6 million related to CMOs classified as Level 3 as of January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008. Determining if a security is other than temporarily impaired is complex and requires judgment by management about circumstances that are inherently uncertain. In particular, these estimates require management to estimate the amount and timing of credit losses on the underlying loans supporting the security. Subsequent evaluations of these securities, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in additional impairment in future periods. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized cost were impaired, we would record a pre tax loss of $439.9 million. Accounting for Financial Derivatives Description We enter into derivative transactions to reduce the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. The majority of derivative transactions we entered into as of December 31, 2008 were cash flow hedges. These hedges, which include a combination of interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and purchased options on caps and floors, are used primarily to reduce the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable rate liabilities and assets and forecasted issuances of liabilities. These cash flow hedge relationships are treated as effective hedges as long as the future issuances of liabilities remain probable and the hedges continue to meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that hedge cash flows associated with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and home equity lines of credit are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as unrealized gains or losses, for both active and terminated hedges. As of December 31, 2008, we had an unrealized pre tax loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $671.3 million related to cash flow hedges. Judgments If the derivatives in these cash flow hedge relationships are determined to be effective hedges, the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss are included in operating interest expense or operating interest income as a yield adjustment during the same periods in which the related interest on the hedged item affects earnings. If the derivatives are determined not to be effective hedges, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The majority of cash flow hedge relationships are hedges of the potential change in cash flows associated with the forecasted issuance of debt. In order to be considered an effective hedge, the forecasted issuance of debt must be considered probable as of the balance sheet date. The future issuance of this debt, including repurchase agreements, is largely dependent on the market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market. As of December 31, 2008, we believe the forecasted issuance of all debt in cash flow hedge relationships is probable. However, unexpected changes in market conditions in future periods could impact our ability to issue 68 Table of Contents this debt. We believe the forecasted issuance of debt in the form of repurchase agreements is most susceptible to an unexpected change in market conditions. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. In particular, if we determined that the forecasted issuance of debt associated with our cash flow hedges was no longer probable, the $671.3 million pre tax loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss) in the period in which this determination was made. This loss would have a material adverse effect on the regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank and our results of operations. Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances Description In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense (benefit) based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income (loss). Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion, net of a valuation allowance (on state and foreign country deferred tax assets) of $127.7 million. At December 31, 2007 we had net deferred tax assets of $550.2 million, net of a valuation allowance (on state and foreign country deferred tax assets) of $91.8 million. Judgments Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income tax expense (benefit), our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations, resolution with taxing authorities of uncertain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. The most significant tax related judgment made by management was the determination of whether to provide for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on 69 Table of Contents identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our retail and institutional segments separately and determined that our net operating losses in 2007 and 2008 were due solely to the credit losses in our institutional segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities portfolio and our home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased the business activities which we believe are the root cause of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in 2007 and 2008. Our retail segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2008, which is considered significant, objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believe we are able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. Effects if Actual Results Differ Changes in our tax expense (benefit) due to the actual effective tax rates differing from our estimates, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company. As of December 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Description We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets net of amortization at December 31, 2008 were $386.1 million, which have useful lives between five and thirty years. Judgments In connection with our annual impairment test of goodwill, we concluded that the goodwill was not impaired. We recognize that as of December 31, 2008, our market capitalization was significantly less than the amount of goodwill recorded on our books. We believe this condition is due to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which has significantly impacted the value of our loan portfolio assumed within our market capitalization. The value of this portfolio is contained in our balance sheet management business, which is a reporting unit in the institutional segment. The goodwill for the balance sheet management business was written off in entirety in the fourth quarter of 2007. The vast majority of the goodwill remaining on our balance sheet is connected to our retail brokerage business, which is a reporting unit in the retail segment. Our evaluation indicates that this unit has a fair value far in excess of the goodwill assigned to it. 70 Table of Contents Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If managements estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occur, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized. Valuation and Expensing of Share Based Payments Description We value and expense employee share based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each periods compensation expense attributed to these options. Judgments We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are managements best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience. Effects if Actual Results Differ If our estimates of employees forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by approximately 7%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods. 71 Table of Contents STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES The following table outlines the information required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.

In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements. We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. The FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances based on the security of pledged home mortgages and other assets principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. Government provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2008, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $3.9 billion at interest rates ranging from 1.43% to 5.56% and at a weighted average rate of 4.15%. We also raise funds by selling securities under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The counterparties to these agreements hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed and variable rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Banks term investment option and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Interest rate cap An options contract that puts an upper limit on a floating exchange rate. The writer of the cap has to pay the holder of the cap the difference between the floating rate and the upper limit when that upper limit is breached. There is usually a premium paid by the buyer of such a contract. Interest rate floor An options contract that puts a lower limit on a floating exchange rate. The writer of the floor has to pay the holder of the floor the difference between the floating rate and the lower limit when that lower limit is breached. There is usually a premium paid by the buyer of such a contract. Interest rate swaps Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed rate payments for floating rate payments, based on notional principal amounts. Main Street Investor The customer segment that includes those who execute less than 30 trades per quarter and hold less than $50,000 in assets in combined retail accounts. Margin debt The extension of credit to brokerage customers of the Company, on and off balance sheet, where the loan is secured with securities owned by the customer. Mass Affluent The customer segment that includes those who hold $50,000 or more in assets in combined retail accounts. Net New Customer Asset Flows The total inflows to all new and existing customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing customer accounts, excluding the effects of market movements in the value of customer assets. Net Present Value of Equity (NPVE) The present value of expected cash inflows from existing assets, minus the present value of expected cash outflows from existing liabilities, plus the expected cash inflows and outflows from existing derivatives and forward commitments. This calculation is performed for E*TRADE Bank. Nonperforming assets Assets that do not earn income, including those originally acquired to earn income (delinquent loans) and those not intended to earn income (REO). Loans are classified as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest and principal becomes uncertain or when the loans are 90 days past due. 79 Table of Contents Notional amount The specified dollar amount underlying a derivative on which the calculated payments are based. Operating margin Income before other income (expense), income tax expense (benefit), minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. Operating margin (%) Percentage of net revenue that goes to income before other income (expense), income tax expense (benefit), minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. It is calculated by dividing our income before other income (expense), income tax expense (benefit), minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change by our total net revenue. Option adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loan An adjustable rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option to make a fully amortizing, interest only, or minimum payment each month. The minimum payment on an Option ARM loan is usually based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate for loans with short duration introductory periods. Options Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a period or at a specified date in the future. Organic Business related to new and existing customers as opposed to acquisitions. Principal transactions Transactions that primarily consist of revenue from market making activities.

Risk weighted assets Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk weightings assigned by the OTS to assets and off balance sheet instruments for capital adequacy calculations. This calculation is for E*TRADE Bank only. Stock conduit The borrowing of shares from a Broker Dealer and subsequently lending the same shares to another Broker Dealer netting a fee. Swaptions Options to enter swaps starting on a given day. Sweep deposit accounts Accounts with the functionality to transfer brokerage cash balances to and from an FDIC insured money market account at the Bank. 80 Table of Contents Taxable equivalent interest adjustment The operating interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal and or state income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement of income (loss), as that is not permitted under GAAP. Tier 1 Capital Adjusted equity capital used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios at E*TRADE Bank as required by the OTS. Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholders equity at E*TRADE Bank, plus/(less) unrealized losses (gains) on available for sale securities and cash flow hedges, less deferred tax assets, goodwill and certain other intangible assets. 81 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest Rate Risk The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable rate and fixed rate assets and liabilities and we utilize derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense: Interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may re price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch. The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short and long term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income. Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize. Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2008, 93% of our total assets were enterprise interest earning assets. At December 31, 2008, approximately 70% of our total assets were residential real estate loans and available for sale mortgage backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment. When real estate loans prepay, unamortized premiums are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of unamortized premiums may result in lower than anticipated yields. The ALCO reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on loan production volumes and prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy. Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and wholesale borrowings. Cash provided to us through deposits is the primary source of our funding. Our key deposit products include sweep accounts, money market and savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Our wholesale borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Customer payables, which represents customer cash contained within our broker dealers, is an additional source of funding. In addition, the parent company has issued a significant amount of corporate debt. Our deposit accounts and customer payables tend to be less rate sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities re price as interest rates change. Sweep, money market and savings accounts re price at managements discretion Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and corporate debt generally have fixed rates. 82 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (Caps) and Floor Options (Floors), Payor Swaptions and Receiver Swaptions. Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates.
