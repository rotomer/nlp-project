ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. GLOSSARY OF TERMS In analyzing and discussing our business, we utilize certain metrics, ratios and other terms that are defined in the Glossary of Terms, which is located at the end of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Strategy Our core business is our trading and investing customer franchise. Building on the strengths of this franchise, our growth strategy is focused on four areas: retail brokerage, corporate services and market making, wealth management, and banking. Our retail brokerage business is our foundation. We believe a focus on these key factors will position us for future growth in this business: growing our sales force with a focus on long term investing, optimizing our marketing spend, continuing to develop innovative products and services and minimizing account attrition. Our corporate services and market making businesses enhance our strategy by allowing us to realize additional economic benefit from our retail brokerage business. Our corporate services business is a leading provider of software and services for managing equity compensation plans and is an important source of new retail brokerage accounts. Our market making business allows us to increase the economic benefit on the order flow from the retail brokerage business as well as generate additional revenues through external order flow. We also plan to expand our wealth management offerings. Our vision is to provide wealth management services that are enabled by innovative technology and supported by guidance from professionals when needed. Our retail brokerage business generates a significant amount of customer cash and we plan to continue to utilize our bank to optimize the value of these customer deposits. Our strategy also includes an intense focus on mitigating the credit losses in our legacy loan portfolio and maintaining disciplined expense management. We remain focused on strengthening our overall capital structure and positioning the Company for future growth. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase; 28 Table of Contents our ability to obtain regulatory approval to move capital from our bank to our parent company; and changes to the rules and regulations governing the financial services industry. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of trading customers; our ability to generate meaningful growth in the long term investing customer group; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; our ability to generate capital sufficient to meet our operating needs, particularly a level sufficient to offset loan losses; our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 Customer Activity Metrics:(1) DARTs 150,532 179,183 169,075 (16 )% Average commission per trade $ 11.21 $ 11.33 $ 10.98 (1 )% Margin receivables (dollars in billions) $ 5.1 $ 3.7 $ 2.7 38 % End of period brokerage accounts 2,684,311 2,630,079 2,515,806 2 % Net new brokerage accounts 54,232 114,273 142,541 * Customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 176.2 $ 150.5 $ 110.1 17 % Net new brokerage assets (dollars in billions) $ 8.1 $ 7.2 $ 3.9 * Brokerage related cash (dollars in billions) $ 24.5 $ 20.4 $ 15.8 20 % Company Financial Metrics: Corporate cash (dollars in millions) $ 470.5 $ 393.2 $ 434.9 20 % E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital (dollars in millions) $ 1,105.6 $ 899.1 $ 714.7 23 % Special mention loan delinquencies (dollars in millions) $ 589.4 $ 804.5 $ 1,035.1 (27 )% Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 1,031.2 $ 1,182.7 $ 1,080.6 (13 )% Enterprise net interest spread 2.91 % 2.72 % 2.52 % 0.19 % Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 41.1 $ 44.5 $ 46.9 (8 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) The prior periods presented have been updated to exclude international local market trading. Customer Activity Metrics DARTs are the predominant driver of commissions revenue from our customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing and is impacted by the mix between our customer groups. Margin receivables represent credit extended to customers and non customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they currently own. Margin receivables are a key driver of net operating interest income. End of period brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts are indicators of our ability to attract and retain trading and investing customers. 29 Table of Contents Changes in customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new brokerage customers. Customer cash and deposits, particularly brokerage related cash, are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. Company Financial Metrics Corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company. It is also a source of cash that can be deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital is the excess capital that E*TRADE Bank has compared to the regulatory minimum to be considered well capitalized and is an indicator of E*TRADE Banks ability to absorb future losses. It is also a potential source of additional corporate cash as this capital, if requested by us and approved by our regulators, could be sent as a dividend or otherwise distributed up to the parent company. Special mention loan delinquencies are loans 30 89 days past due and are an indicator of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off. Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to the expected charge offs in our loan portfolio over the next twelve months as well as the estimated charge offs, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified in troubled debt restructurings. The general allowance for loan losses also includes a specific qualitative component to account for a variety of economic and operational factors, including the uncertainty of how modified loans will perform over the long term, which we believe may impact our level of credit losses. Enterprise interest earning assets, in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread, are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Significant Events in 2010 Enhancements to Our Trading and Investing Products and Services We expanded our advice offering by introducing managed investment portfolio advisory services to long term investors with an investment of $25,000 or more, and unified managed account advisory services to long term investors with an investment of $250,000 or more; We expanded Power E*TRADE Pros customization capabilities, navigation tools, and news and information, including CNBC Plus streaming video; We launched the E*TRADE Mobile Pro application for Apple iPad and Android Smartphones, expanding our suite of mobile applications, which already included Blackberry&reg; and Apple iPhone; We created Open API for third party and independent software developers, which allows customers to have access to technical information and documentation, reference guides, and other resources to help network external applications and programs with our active trader platform; and We introduced new research and trade idea generation tools that we believe help our customers identify investment opportunities and make informed decisions. These new tools include market commentary from Dreyfus and Minyanvilles Buzz & Banter, a business and finance site. 30 Table of Contents Simplified Commission and Fee Structure In February 2010, we announced several changes to the pricing structure in our brokerage business. We eliminated the $12.99 commission tier, account activity fees and a per share commission applied to market trades larger than 2,000 shares. We believe these changes simplified our overall pricing structure. Market Recognition Our corporate services business rated highest in overall satisfaction and loyalty among broker plan administrators for full and partial outsourced stock plan administration by GROUP FIVE, an independent consulting and research firm, in their 2010 Stock Plan Administration Benchmarking Study. Completed the Sale of Approximately $1 Billion in Deposits We sold approximately $1 billion of savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in March 2010. This transaction is in line with our overall strategy of reducing our balance sheet and growing our brokerage business as the savings accounts sold were predominantly with customers not affiliated with an active brokerage account. Completion of 1 for 10 Reverse Stock Split In June 2010, we completed a 1 for 10 reverse stock split. All prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split, including the impact on basic and diluted weighted average shares and shares issued and outstanding. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2010 Compared to 2009 We incurred a net loss of $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, due primarily to provision for loan losses of $779.4 million. Our provision for loan losses reported in our balance sheet management segment more than offset the strong performance of our trading and investing segment, which generated segment income of $721.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The provision for loan losses has declined for two consecutive years and we expect it to continue to decline in 2011 when compared to 2010, although performance is subject to variability in any given quarter. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our net revenue, provision for loan losses, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). 31 Table of Contents Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,226.3 $ 1,260.6 $ (34.3 ) (3 )% Commissions 431.0 548.0 (117.0 ) (21 )% Fees and service charges 142.4 192.5 (50.1 ) (26 )% Principal transactions 103.4 88.1 15.3 17 % Gains on loans and securities, net 166.2 169.1 (2.9 ) (2 )% Net impairment (37.7 ) (89.1 ) * * Other revenues 46.3 47.8 (1.5 ) (3 )% Total non interest income 851.6 956.4 (104.8 ) (11 )% Total net revenue $ 2,077.9 $ 2,217.0 $ (139.1 ) (6 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Total net revenue decreased 6% to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This was driven by lower commissions, fees and service charges and net operating interest income, which was slightly offset by a decrease in net impairment and an increase in principal transactions. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 3% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through investing customer cash and deposits in interest earning assets, which include margin receivables, real estate loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities. The slight decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest earning assets of $3.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, which was offset by an increase in our net operating interest spread during the same period. 32 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

Income on such nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. (2) Non operating interest earning and non interest earning assets consist of property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets that do not generate operating interest income. Some of these assets generate corporate interest income. (3) Non operating interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities consist of corporate debt and other liabilities that do not generate operating interest expense. Some of these liabilities generate corporate interest expense. (4) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, held by parties outside the Company, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. 33 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.91 % 2.72 % 2.52 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.96 % 2.80 % 2.66 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 106.49 % 106.36 % 105.40 % Return on average: Total assets (0.06 )% (2.68 )% (0.99 )% Total shareholders equity (0.71 )% (43.61 )% (18.98 )% Average equity to average total assets 8.84 % 6.15 % 5.20 % Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 8% to $41.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in our average loans portfolio, average available for sale mortgage backed securities and average cash and equivalents, partially offset by an increase in average margin receivables, average available for sale investment securities and average held to maturity securities. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 8% to $38.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to decreases in average complete savings deposits and average certificates of deposit offset by an increase in average sweep deposits. Enterprise net interest spread increased by 19 basis points to 2.91% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was largely driven by a decrease in the yields paid on our deposits and lower wholesale borrowing costs, partially offset by a decrease in higher yielding enterprise interest earning assets. Commissions Commissions decreased 21% to $431.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The main factors that affect our commissions are DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days during the period. Average commission per trade is impacted by different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, stock plan, exchange traded funds, mutual funds and cross border) that can have different commission rates. Accordingly, changes in the mix of trade types will impact average commission per trade. Our DART volume decreased 16% to 150,532 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. Option related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 17% and 13% of trading volume for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 10% and 14% of trading volume for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Average commission per trade decreased 1% to $11.21 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The slight decrease in the average commission per trade was due primarily to the elimination of the $12.99 commission tier and the per share commission applied to market trades larger than 2,000 shares, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by an improvement in the product and customer mix when compared to the same period in 2009. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 26% to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination of all account activity fees, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, and lower order flow revenue. 34 Table of Contents Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 17% to $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Our principal transactions are derived from our market making business in which we act as a market maker for our brokerage customers orders as well as orders from third party customers. The increase in principal transactions was driven by an increase in the volume of orders from our third party customers which was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue earned per share traded when compared to the same period in 2009. Gains on Loans and Securities, Net Gains on loans and securities, net were $166.2 million and $169.1 million for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Gains (losses) on loans, net $ 6.3 $ (12.5 ) $ 18.8 * Gains on available for sale securities and other investments, net 160.7 173.2 (12.5 ) (7 )% Gains on trading securities, net 0.2 7.8 (7.6 ) (98 )% Hedge ineffectiveness (1.0 ) 0.6 (1.6 ) * Gains on securities, net 159.9 181.6 (21.7 ) (12 )% Gains on loans and securities, net $ 166.2 $ 169.1 $ (2.9 ) (2 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Net Impairment We recognized $37.7 million and $89.1 million of net impairment during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. The gross other than temporary impairment (OTTI) and the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income (loss), are shown in the table below (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) $ (41.5 ) $ (232.1 ) Less: noncredit portion of OTTI recognized into other comprehensive income (loss) (before tax) 3.8 143.0 Net impairment $ (37.7 ) $ (89.1 ) Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 3% to $46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due to a decline in the income from the cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance, partially offset by the gain on the sale of approximately $1 billion in savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in the first quarter of 2010. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 48% to $779.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. The decrease in our provision for loan losses was driven by lower levels of at risk (30 179 days delinquent) loans in our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. We believe the delinquencies in 35 Table of Contents both of these portfolios were caused by several factors, including: significant continued home price depreciation; weak demand for homes and high inventories of unsold homes; significant contraction in the availability of credit; and a general decline in economic growth along with higher levels of unemployment. In addition, the combined impact of home price depreciation and the reduction of available credit made it difficult for borrowers to refinance existing loans. The provision for loan losses has declined for two consecutive years and we expect it to continue to decline in 2011 when compared to 2010, although performance is subject to variability in any given quarter. Operating Expenses The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 325.0 $ 366.2 $ (41.2 ) (11 )% Clearing and servicing 147.5 170.7 (23.2 ) (14 )% Advertising and market development 132.2 114.4 17.8 16 % Professional services 81.2 78.7 2.5 3 % FDIC insurance premiums 77.7 94.3 (16.6 ) (18 )% Communications 73.3 84.4 (11.1 ) (13 )% Occupancy and equipment 70.9 78.4 (7.5 ) (10 )% Depreciation and amortization 87.9 83.3 4.6 6 % Amortization of other intangibles 28.5 29.7 (1.2 ) (4 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 14.4 20.7 (6.3 ) (31 )% Other operating expenses 104.0 122.5 (18.5 ) (15 )% Total operating expense $ 1,142.6 $ 1,243.3 $ (100.7 ) (8 )% Operating expense decreased 8% to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The fluctuation was driven by decreases in the majority of operating expense categories, offset by a planned increase in advertising and market development. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 11% to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted from lower incentive compensation expense and lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base compared to the same period in 2009. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense decreased 14% to $147.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted primarily from lower trading volumes and lower loan balances compared to the same period in 2009. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 16% to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This fluctuation was due largely to a planned increase in advertising expense to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended December 31, 2010. 36 Table of Contents FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums decreased 18% to $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due primarily to an industry wide special assessment that resulted in an additional $21.6 million of expense in the second quarter of 2009. There were no similar assessments made during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased 15% to $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in bad debt expense, real estate owned and legal reserves compared to 2009. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $159.0 million and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Corporate interest income $ 6.2 $ 0.9 $ 5.3 620 % Corporate interest expense (167.1 ) (282.7 ) 115.6 (41 )% Gains (losses) on sales of investments, net 2.7 (1.7 ) 4.4 * Losses on early extinguishment of debt (1,018.9 ) 1,018.9 (100 )% Equity in loss of investments and venture funds (0.8 ) (8.6 ) 7.8 (91 )% Total other income (expense) $ (159.0 ) $ (1,311.0 ) $ 1,152.0 (88 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from our interest bearing corporate debt. Corporate interest expense decreased 41% to $167.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This was due to the reduction in interest bearing debt in connection with our Debt Exchange in 2009. The losses on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2009 were related primarily to the Debt Exchange. The loss on the Debt Exchange resulted from the de recognition of the debt that was exchanged and the corresponding recognition of the newly issued non interest bearing convertible debentures at fair value. Corporate interest income increased to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009 due to a benefit of $6.0 million in connection with a legal settlement. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense was $25.3 million and a benefit of $537.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 806.3% and (29.3)% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was higher than in 2009 for two reasons: 1) our pre tax loss included items not deductible for tax purposes, predominantly about one third of the interest expense on the 12 1/2% springing lien notes; and 2) our reported pre tax loss is relatively close to breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result, our income subject to taxation is higher, resulting in an unusually high effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. We expect our effective tax rate to be volatile in periods where pre tax income or loss is relatively close to breakeven, but expect a more normalized rate as, and to the extent, we become profitable in future periods. 37 Table of Contents Valuation Allowance We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required, the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our trading and investing and balance sheet management segments separately and determined that our net operating losses since 2007 are due solely to the credit losses in our balance sheet management segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008, 2009 and 2010. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased purchasing asset backed securities and home equity loans which we believe are the root cause of the majority of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in the three year period ending in 2010. Our trading and investing segment generated substantial taxable income for each of the last seven years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. A key component of our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance was our level of corporate interest expense, which represents our most significant non operating related expense. Our estimates of future taxable income included this expense, which reduces the amount of segment income available to utilize our federal deferred tax assets. Therefore, a decrease in this expense in future periods would increase the level of estimated taxable income available to utilize our federal deferred tax assets. As a result of the Debt Exchange in 2009, we reduced our annual cash interest payments by approximately $200 million. We believe this decline in cash interest payments significantly improves our ability to utilize our federal deferred tax assets in future periods when compared to evaluations in prior periods which did not include this decline in corporate interest payments. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2010, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, in 2010, we generated taxable income consistent with our forecast that resulted in the utilization of significant net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we are able to continue relying on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in our results of operations. This volatility is isolated almost entirely to our balance sheet management segment. Our forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding our estimate of future expected credit losses, which we believe to be the most variable component of our forecasts of future taxable income. We believe this variability could create a book loss in our overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting our overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which we expect to realize our deferred tax assets. Conversely, we believe our trading and investing segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which we believe we can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which we estimate we will realize our deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. 38 Table of Contents We have maintained a valuation allowance for certain of our state deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. At December 31, 2010, we had a deferred tax asset of approximately $108.9 million that related to our state net operating loss carryforwards with a valuation allowance of $34.0 million against such deferred tax asset. The change in our valuation allowance during 2010 was primarily due to reclassification of unrealized tax benefit offset by current year activity. The majority of the reclassified unrecognized tax benefit relates to the application of Section 382 to state net operating losses. Tax Ownership Change During the third quarter of 2009, we exchanged $1.7 billion principal amount of our interest bearing debt for an equal principal amount of non interest bearing convertible debentures. Subsequent to the Debt Exchange, $592.3 million and $720.9 million debentures were converted into 57.2 million and 69.7 million shares of common stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2009, respectively. As a result of these conversions, we believe we experienced a tax ownership change during the third quarter of 2009. As of the date of the ownership change, we had federal NOLs available to carryforward of approximately $1.4 billion. Section 382 imposes restrictions on the use of a corporations NOLs, certain recognized built in losses and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs. Section 382 rules governing when a change in ownership occurs are complex and subject to interpretation; however, an ownership change generally occurs when there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of a corporation by certain 5% shareholders of more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three year period. Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change NOLs. In general, the annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the corporations stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long term tax exempt rate. Any unused portion of the annual limitation is available for use in future years until such NOLs are scheduled to expire (in general, our NOLs may be carried forward 20 years). In addition, the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses, respectively, which may be present with respect to assets held at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period (one year for loans) after the ownership change. The use of NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected unless a corporation experienced an additional ownership change in a future period. We believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre ownership change NOLs, but will not limit the total amount of pre ownership change NOLs we can utilize. Our updated estimate is that we will be subject to an overall annual limitation on the use of our pre ownership change NOLs of approximately $194 million. Our overall pre ownership change NOLs, which were approximately $1.4 billion, have a statutory carryforward period of 20 years (the majority of which expire in 17 years). As a result, we believe we will be able to fully utilize these NOLs in future periods. Our ability to utilize the pre ownership change NOLs is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income over the duration of the carryforward periods and will not be impacted by our ability or inability to generate taxable income in an individual year. 2009 Compared to 2008 We incurred a net loss of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 due principally to the Debt Exchange that resulted in a non cash loss of $772.9 million (pre tax loss of $968.3 million) on early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of 2009. Our trading and investing segment income was $760.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. However, the provision for loan losses in our balance sheet management segment more than offset this strong performance, resulting in a consolidated loss before income taxes of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. 39 Table of Contents On April 1, 2009, we adopted the amended guidance for the recognition of OTTI for debt securities as well as the presentation of OTTI on the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the adoption, we recognized a $20.2 million after tax decrease to beginning accumulated deficit and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment represents the after tax difference between the impairment reported in prior periods for securities on our balance sheet as of April 1, 2009 and the level of impairment that would have been recorded on these same securities under the new accounting guidance. Additionally, in accordance with the new guidance, we changed the presentation of the consolidated statement of loss to state net impairment as a separate line item, as well as the credit and noncredit components of net impairment. Prior to this new presentation, OTTI was included in the gains (losses) on loans and securities, net line item on the consolidated statement of loss. Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2009 2008 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,260.6 $ 1,268.0 $ (7.4 ) (1 )% Commissions 548.0 515.5 32.5 6 % Fees and service charges 192.5 200.0 (7.5 ) (4 )% Principal transactions 88.1 84.9 3.2 4 % Gains (losses) on loans and securities, net 169.1 (100.5 ) 269.6 * Net impairment (89.1 ) (95.0 ) * * Other revenues 47.8 52.7 (4.9 ) (9 )% Total non interest income 956.4 657.6 298.8 45 % Total net revenue $ 2,217.0 $ 1,925.6 $ 291.4 15 % * Percentage not meaningful. Total net revenue increased 15% to $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This was driven by our gains (losses) on loans and securities, net, which increased from net losses of $100.5 million to net gains of $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Commissions also increased $32.5 million to $548.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 1% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The slight decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest earning assets of $2.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009, which was largely offset by an increase in our net operating interest spread during the same period. Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 5% to $44.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in our average loans portfolio and our average margin receivables, partially offset by an increase in average cash and equivalents. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 6% to $41.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in average FHLB advances, average brokered certificates of deposit and average securities loaned and other. 40 Table of Contents Enterprise net interest spread increased by 20 basis points to 2.72% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was largely driven by a decrease in the yields paid on our deposits and lower wholesale borrowing costs, partially offset by a decrease in higher yielding enterprise interest earning assets. Commissions Commissions increased 6% to $548.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Our DART volume increased 6% to 179,183 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Option related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 13% and 15% of trading volume for the years December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 14% and 11% of trading volume for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Average commission per trade increased 3% to $11.33 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in the average commission per trade for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to an improvement in product and customer mix compared to 2008. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 4% to $192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by a decrease in account service fee and advisory management fee revenue, which was partially offset by an increase in order flow revenue compared to 2008. The decrease in advisory management fees was primarily due to the sale of an advisor business in the second quarter of 2008. Declines in foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees also contributed to the decrease in fees and service charges. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 4% to $88.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in principal transactions was driven by an increase in the volume of equity shares that were traded, which was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue earned per share traded for the year ended December 31, 2009. Gains (Losses) on Loans and Securities, Net Gains (losses) on loans and securities, net were gains of $169.1 million and losses of $100.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2009 2008 Amount % Losses on sales of loans, net $ (12.5 ) $ (0.8 ) $ (11.7 ) 1496 % Gains on available for sale securities and other investments, net 173.2 32.4 140.8 435 % Gains (losses) on trading securities, net 7.8 (134.3 ) 142.1 * Hedge ineffectiveness 0.6 2.2 (1.6 ) (74 )% Gains (losses) on securities, net 181.6 (99.7 ) 281.3 * Gains (losses) on loans and securities, net $ 169.1 $ (100.5 ) $ 269.6 * * Percentage not meaningful. Gains on loans and securities, net for the year ended December 31, 2009, were due primarily to gains on the sale of certain agency mortgage backed securities, which were partially offset by net losses on the sales of loans. 41 Table of Contents Losses on the sales of loans were due to the sale of a $0.4 billion pool of home equity loans during the third quarter of 2009. Losses on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2008 were due primarily to losses on our preferred stock in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Net Impairment We recognized $89.1 million of net impairment during the year ended December 31, 2009, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. The net impairment included gross OTTI of $232.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Of the $232.1 million of gross OTTI for the year ended December 31, 2009, $143.0 million related to the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was recorded through other comprehensive income (loss). We had net impairment of $95.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which represented the total decline in the fair value of impaired securities in accordance with the OTTI accounting guidance that was in effect prior to April 1, 2009. Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 9% to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in other revenue was driven by lower employee stock option management fees from our corporate services business. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased $85.6 million to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 was due primarily to the high levels of delinquent loans in our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. Operating Expenses The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2009 2008 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 366.2 $ 383.4 $ (17.2 ) (4 )% Clearing and servicing 170.7 185.1 (14.4 ) (8 )% Advertising and market development 114.4 175.2 (60.8 ) (35 )% Professional services 78.7 94.1 (15.4 ) (16 )% FDIC insurance premiums 94.3 31.2 63.1 202 % Communications 84.4 96.8 (12.4 ) (13 )% Occupancy and equipment 78.4 85.8 (7.4 ) (9 )% Depreciation and amortization 83.3 82.5 0.8 1 % Amortization of other intangibles 29.7 35.7 (6.0 ) (17 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 20.7 29.5 (8.8 ) (30 )% Other operating expenses 122.5 90.9 31.6 35 % Total operating expense $ 1,243.3 $ 1,290.2 $ (46.9 ) (4 )% Operating expense decreased 4% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by decreases in the majority of the operating expense categories, offset by increases in FDIC insurance premiums and other operating expenses. 42 Table of Contents Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 4% to $366.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted primarily from lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base of 5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense decreased 35% to $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was due to high levels of advertising in the first half of 2008 that was aimed at restoring customer confidence as well as an overall decline in advertising rates in the year ended December 31, 2009. FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums increased 202% to $94.3 million for the year December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the ongoing FDIC insurance rates as well as an industry wide special assessment in the second quarter of 2009. Our portion of this special assessment was $21.6 million. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These costs were due primarily to the restructuring of our international brokerage business. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased 35% to $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to a $23.7 million gain on the sale of our corporate aircraft related assets during the year ended December 31, 2008, which reduced other operating expenses during that period and to higher real estate owned expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to an expense of $330.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total other expense of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 was largely due to the $968.3 million pre tax non cash loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to our Debt Exchange. The loss on the Debt Exchange resulted from the de recognition of the debt that was exchanged and the corresponding recognition of the newly issued non interest bearing convertible debentures at fair value. Total other income (expense) also includes corporate interest expense resulting from our interest bearing corporate debt. Corporate interest expense decreased 22% to $282.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the reduction in interest bearing debt in connection with our Debt Exchange. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit from continuing operations was $537.7 million and $469.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rates were (29.3)% and (36.7)% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Debt Exchange The effective tax rate on the Debt Exchange of 20% was below our statutory federal tax rate of 35%. This was primarily due to certain components of the loss on the Debt Exchange not being deductible for tax purposes, which are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 Amount of Loss Tax Rate Tax Benefit Deductible portion of the loss on the Debt Exchange $ 723.0 35 % $ 253.0 Non deductible portion of the loss on the Debt Exchange 245.3 Prior period interest expense on the 12 1/2% Notes not deductible as a result of the Debt Exchange N/A N/A (57.7 ) Total $ 968.3 20 % $ 195.3 Valuation Allowance During the year ended December 31, 2009, we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as we believed that it was more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we were in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2009, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believed we were able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW We report our operating results in two segments: 1) trading and investing; and 2) balance sheet management. Trading and investing includes retail brokerage products and services; investor focused banking products; market making; and corporate services. Balance sheet management includes the management of asset allocation and credit, liquidity and interest rate risk; loans previously originated or purchased from third parties; and customer cash and deposits. Costs associated with certain functions that are centrally managed are separately reported in a Corporate/Other category.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Strategy Our core business is our trading and investing customer franchise. Building on the strengths of this franchise, our growth strategy is focused on four areas: retail brokerage, corporate services and market making, wealth management, and banking. Our retail brokerage business is our foundation. We believe a focus on these key factors will position us for future growth in this business: growing our sales force with a focus on long term investing, optimizing our marketing spend, continuing to develop innovative products and services and minimizing account attrition. Our corporate services and market making businesses enhance our strategy by allowing us to realize additional economic benefit from our retail brokerage business. Our corporate services business is a leading provider of software and services for managing equity compensation plans and is an important source of new retail brokerage accounts. Our market making business allows us to increase the economic benefit on the order flow from the retail brokerage business as well as generate additional revenues through external order flow. We also plan to expand our wealth management offerings. Our vision is to provide wealth management services that are enabled by innovative technology and supported by guidance from professionals when needed. Our retail brokerage business generates a significant amount of customer cash and we plan to continue to utilize our bank to optimize the value of these customer deposits. Our strategy also includes an intense focus on mitigating the credit losses in our legacy loan portfolio and maintaining disciplined expense management. We remain focused on strengthening our overall capital structure and positioning the Company for future growth. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase; 28 Table of Contents our ability to obtain regulatory approval to move capital from our bank to our parent company; and changes to the rules and regulations governing the financial services industry. In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of trading customers; our ability to generate meaningful growth in the long term investing customer group; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; our ability to generate capital sufficient to meet our operating needs, particularly a level sufficient to offset loan losses; our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 Customer Activity Metrics:(1) DARTs 150,532 179,183 169,075 (16 )% Average commission per trade $ 11.21 $ 11.33 $ 10.98 (1 )% Margin receivables (dollars in billions) $ 5.1 $ 3.7 $ 2.7 38 % End of period brokerage accounts 2,684,311 2,630,079 2,515,806 2 % Net new brokerage accounts 54,232 114,273 142,541 * Customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 176.2 $ 150.5 $ 110.1 17 % Net new brokerage assets (dollars in billions) $ 8.1 $ 7.2 $ 3.9 * Brokerage related cash (dollars in billions) $ 24.5 $ 20.4 $ 15.8 20 % Company Financial Metrics: Corporate cash (dollars in millions) $ 470.5 $ 393.2 $ 434.9 20 % E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital (dollars in millions) $ 1,105.6 $ 899.1 $ 714.7 23 % Special mention loan delinquencies (dollars in millions) $ 589.4 $ 804.5 $ 1,035.1 (27 )% Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 1,031.2 $ 1,182.7 $ 1,080.6 (13 )% Enterprise net interest spread 2.91 % 2.72 % 2.52 % 0.19 % Enterprise interest earning assets (average in billions) $ 41.1 $ 44.5 $ 46.9 (8 )% * Percentage not meaningful. (1) The prior periods presented have been updated to exclude international local market trading. Customer Activity Metrics DARTs are the predominant driver of commissions revenue from our customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing and is impacted by the mix between our customer groups. Margin receivables represent credit extended to customers and non customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they currently own. Margin receivables are a key driver of net operating interest income. End of period brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts are indicators of our ability to attract and retain trading and investing customers. 29 Table of Contents Changes in customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new brokerage customers. Customer cash and deposits, particularly brokerage related cash, are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. Company Financial Metrics Corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company. It is also a source of cash that can be deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. E*TRADE Bank excess risk based capital is the excess capital that E*TRADE Bank has compared to the regulatory minimum to be considered well capitalized and is an indicator of E*TRADE Banks ability to absorb future losses. It is also a potential source of additional corporate cash as this capital, if requested by us and approved by our regulators, could be sent as a dividend or otherwise distributed up to the parent company. Special mention loan delinquencies are loans 30 89 days past due and are an indicator of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off. Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to the expected charge offs in our loan portfolio over the next twelve months as well as the estimated charge offs, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified in troubled debt restructurings. The general allowance for loan losses also includes a specific qualitative component to account for a variety of economic and operational factors, including the uncertainty of how modified loans will perform over the long term, which we believe may impact our level of credit losses. Enterprise interest earning assets, in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread, are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income. Significant Events in 2010 Enhancements to Our Trading and Investing Products and Services We expanded our advice offering by introducing managed investment portfolio advisory services to long term investors with an investment of $25,000 or more, and unified managed account advisory services to long term investors with an investment of $250,000 or more; We expanded Power E*TRADE Pros customization capabilities, navigation tools, and news and information, including CNBC Plus streaming video; We launched the E*TRADE Mobile Pro application for Apple iPad and Android Smartphones, expanding our suite of mobile applications, which already included Blackberry&reg; and Apple iPhone; We created Open API for third party and independent software developers, which allows customers to have access to technical information and documentation, reference guides, and other resources to help network external applications and programs with our active trader platform; and We introduced new research and trade idea generation tools that we believe help our customers identify investment opportunities and make informed decisions. These new tools include market commentary from Dreyfus and Minyanvilles Buzz & Banter, a business and finance site. 30 Table of Contents Simplified Commission and Fee Structure In February 2010, we announced several changes to the pricing structure in our brokerage business. We eliminated the $12.99 commission tier, account activity fees and a per share commission applied to market trades larger than 2,000 shares. We believe these changes simplified our overall pricing structure. Market Recognition Our corporate services business rated highest in overall satisfaction and loyalty among broker plan administrators for full and partial outsourced stock plan administration by GROUP FIVE, an independent consulting and research firm, in their 2010 Stock Plan Administration Benchmarking Study. Completed the Sale of Approximately $1 Billion in Deposits We sold approximately $1 billion of savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in March 2010. This transaction is in line with our overall strategy of reducing our balance sheet and growing our brokerage business as the savings accounts sold were predominantly with customers not affiliated with an active brokerage account. Completion of 1 for 10 Reverse Stock Split In June 2010, we completed a 1 for 10 reverse stock split. All prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split, including the impact on basic and diluted weighted average shares and shares issued and outstanding. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2010 Compared to 2009 We incurred a net loss of $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, due primarily to provision for loan losses of $779.4 million. Our provision for loan losses reported in our balance sheet management segment more than offset the strong performance of our trading and investing segment, which generated segment income of $721.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The provision for loan losses has declined for two consecutive years and we expect it to continue to decline in 2011 when compared to 2010, although performance is subject to variability in any given quarter. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our net revenue, provision for loan losses, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). 31 Table of Contents Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,226.3 $ 1,260.6 $ (34.3 ) (3 )% Commissions 431.0 548.0 (117.0 ) (21 )% Fees and service charges 142.4 192.5 (50.1 ) (26 )% Principal transactions 103.4 88.1 15.3 17 % Gains on loans and securities, net 166.2 169.1 (2.9 ) (2 )% Net impairment (37.7 ) (89.1 ) * * Other revenues 46.3 47.8 (1.5 ) (3 )% Total non interest income 851.6 956.4 (104.8 ) (11 )% Total net revenue $ 2,077.9 $ 2,217.0 $ (139.1 ) (6 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Total net revenue decreased 6% to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This was driven by lower commissions, fees and service charges and net operating interest income, which was slightly offset by a decrease in net impairment and an increase in principal transactions. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 3% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through investing customer cash and deposits in interest earning assets, which include margin receivables, real estate loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities. The slight decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest earning assets of $3.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, which was offset by an increase in our net operating interest spread during the same period. 32 Table of Contents The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

Income on such nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. (2) Non operating interest earning and non interest earning assets consist of property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets that do not generate operating interest income. Some of these assets generate corporate interest income. (3) Non operating interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities consist of corporate debt and other liabilities that do not generate operating interest expense. Some of these liabilities generate corporate interest expense. (4) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, held by parties outside the Company, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. 33 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.91 % 2.72 % 2.52 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.96 % 2.80 % 2.66 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 106.49 % 106.36 % 105.40 % Return on average: Total assets (0.06 )% (2.68 )% (0.99 )% Total shareholders equity (0.71 )% (43.61 )% (18.98 )% Average equity to average total assets 8.84 % 6.15 % 5.20 % Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 8% to $41.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in our average loans portfolio, average available for sale mortgage backed securities and average cash and equivalents, partially offset by an increase in average margin receivables, average available for sale investment securities and average held to maturity securities. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 8% to $38.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to decreases in average complete savings deposits and average certificates of deposit offset by an increase in average sweep deposits. Enterprise net interest spread increased by 19 basis points to 2.91% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was largely driven by a decrease in the yields paid on our deposits and lower wholesale borrowing costs, partially offset by a decrease in higher yielding enterprise interest earning assets. Commissions Commissions decreased 21% to $431.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The main factors that affect our commissions are DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days during the period. Average commission per trade is impacted by different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, stock plan, exchange traded funds, mutual funds and cross border) that can have different commission rates. Accordingly, changes in the mix of trade types will impact average commission per trade. Our DART volume decreased 16% to 150,532 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. Option related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 17% and 13% of trading volume for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 10% and 14% of trading volume for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Average commission per trade decreased 1% to $11.21 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The slight decrease in the average commission per trade was due primarily to the elimination of the $12.99 commission tier and the per share commission applied to market trades larger than 2,000 shares, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by an improvement in the product and customer mix when compared to the same period in 2009. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 26% to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination of all account activity fees, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, and lower order flow revenue. 34 Table of Contents Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 17% to $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Our principal transactions are derived from our market making business in which we act as a market maker for our brokerage customers orders as well as orders from third party customers. The increase in principal transactions was driven by an increase in the volume of orders from our third party customers which was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue earned per share traded when compared to the same period in 2009. Gains on Loans and Securities, Net Gains on loans and securities, net were $166.2 million and $169.1 million for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Gains (losses) on loans, net $ 6.3 $ (12.5 ) $ 18.8 * Gains on available for sale securities and other investments, net 160.7 173.2 (12.5 ) (7 )% Gains on trading securities, net 0.2 7.8 (7.6 ) (98 )% Hedge ineffectiveness (1.0 ) 0.6 (1.6 ) * Gains on securities, net 159.9 181.6 (21.7 ) (12 )% Gains on loans and securities, net $ 166.2 $ 169.1 $ (2.9 ) (2 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Net Impairment We recognized $37.7 million and $89.1 million of net impairment during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. The gross other than temporary impairment (OTTI) and the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income (loss), are shown in the table below (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) $ (41.5 ) $ (232.1 ) Less: noncredit portion of OTTI recognized into other comprehensive income (loss) (before tax) 3.8 143.0 Net impairment $ (37.7 ) $ (89.1 ) Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 3% to $46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due to a decline in the income from the cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance, partially offset by the gain on the sale of approximately $1 billion in savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in the first quarter of 2010. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 48% to $779.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. The decrease in our provision for loan losses was driven by lower levels of at risk (30 179 days delinquent) loans in our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. We believe the delinquencies in 35 Table of Contents both of these portfolios were caused by several factors, including: significant continued home price depreciation; weak demand for homes and high inventories of unsold homes; significant contraction in the availability of credit; and a general decline in economic growth along with higher levels of unemployment. In addition, the combined impact of home price depreciation and the reduction of available credit made it difficult for borrowers to refinance existing loans. The provision for loan losses has declined for two consecutive years and we expect it to continue to decline in 2011 when compared to 2010, although performance is subject to variability in any given quarter. Operating Expenses The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 325.0 $ 366.2 $ (41.2 ) (11 )% Clearing and servicing 147.5 170.7 (23.2 ) (14 )% Advertising and market development 132.2 114.4 17.8 16 % Professional services 81.2 78.7 2.5 3 % FDIC insurance premiums 77.7 94.3 (16.6 ) (18 )% Communications 73.3 84.4 (11.1 ) (13 )% Occupancy and equipment 70.9 78.4 (7.5 ) (10 )% Depreciation and amortization 87.9 83.3 4.6 6 % Amortization of other intangibles 28.5 29.7 (1.2 ) (4 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 14.4 20.7 (6.3 ) (31 )% Other operating expenses 104.0 122.5 (18.5 ) (15 )% Total operating expense $ 1,142.6 $ 1,243.3 $ (100.7 ) (8 )% Operating expense decreased 8% to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The fluctuation was driven by decreases in the majority of operating expense categories, offset by a planned increase in advertising and market development. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 11% to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted from lower incentive compensation expense and lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base compared to the same period in 2009. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense decreased 14% to $147.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted primarily from lower trading volumes and lower loan balances compared to the same period in 2009. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 16% to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This fluctuation was due largely to a planned increase in advertising expense to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended December 31, 2010. 36 Table of Contents FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums decreased 18% to $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due primarily to an industry wide special assessment that resulted in an additional $21.6 million of expense in the second quarter of 2009. There were no similar assessments made during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased 15% to $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in bad debt expense, real estate owned and legal reserves compared to 2009. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $159.0 million and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Corporate interest income $ 6.2 $ 0.9 $ 5.3 620 % Corporate interest expense (167.1 ) (282.7 ) 115.6 (41 )% Gains (losses) on sales of investments, net 2.7 (1.7 ) 4.4 * Losses on early extinguishment of debt (1,018.9 ) 1,018.9 (100 )% Equity in loss of investments and venture funds (0.8 ) (8.6 ) 7.8 (91 )% Total other income (expense) $ (159.0 ) $ (1,311.0 ) $ 1,152.0 (88 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from our interest bearing corporate debt. Corporate interest expense decreased 41% to $167.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This was due to the reduction in interest bearing debt in connection with our Debt Exchange in 2009. The losses on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2009 were related primarily to the Debt Exchange. The loss on the Debt Exchange resulted from the de recognition of the debt that was exchanged and the corresponding recognition of the newly issued non interest bearing convertible debentures at fair value. Corporate interest income increased to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009 due to a benefit of $6.0 million in connection with a legal settlement. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense was $25.3 million and a benefit of $537.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 806.3% and (29.3)% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was higher than in 2009 for two reasons: 1) our pre tax loss included items not deductible for tax purposes, predominantly about one third of the interest expense on the 12 1/2% springing lien notes; and 2) our reported pre tax loss is relatively close to breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result, our income subject to taxation is higher, resulting in an unusually high effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. We expect our effective tax rate to be volatile in periods where pre tax income or loss is relatively close to breakeven, but expect a more normalized rate as, and to the extent, we become profitable in future periods. 37 Table of Contents Valuation Allowance We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required, the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our trading and investing and balance sheet management segments separately and determined that our net operating losses since 2007 are due solely to the credit losses in our balance sheet management segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008, 2009 and 2010. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased purchasing asset backed securities and home equity loans which we believe are the root cause of the majority of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in the three year period ending in 2010. Our trading and investing segment generated substantial taxable income for each of the last seven years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. A key component of our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance was our level of corporate interest expense, which represents our most significant non operating related expense. Our estimates of future taxable income included this expense, which reduces the amount of segment income available to utilize our federal deferred tax assets. Therefore, a decrease in this expense in future periods would increase the level of estimated taxable income available to utilize our federal deferred tax assets. As a result of the Debt Exchange in 2009, we reduced our annual cash interest payments by approximately $200 million. We believe this decline in cash interest payments significantly improves our ability to utilize our federal deferred tax assets in future periods when compared to evaluations in prior periods which did not include this decline in corporate interest payments. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2010, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, in 2010, we generated taxable income consistent with our forecast that resulted in the utilization of significant net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we are able to continue relying on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in our results of operations. This volatility is isolated almost entirely to our balance sheet management segment. Our forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding our estimate of future expected credit losses, which we believe to be the most variable component of our forecasts of future taxable income. We believe this variability could create a book loss in our overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting our overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which we expect to realize our deferred tax assets. Conversely, we believe our trading and investing segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which we believe we can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which we estimate we will realize our deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. 38 Table of Contents We have maintained a valuation allowance for certain of our state deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. At December 31, 2010, we had a deferred tax asset of approximately $108.9 million that related to our state net operating loss carryforwards with a valuation allowance of $34.0 million against such deferred tax asset. The change in our valuation allowance during 2010 was primarily due to reclassification of unrealized tax benefit offset by current year activity. The majority of the reclassified unrecognized tax benefit relates to the application of Section 382 to state net operating losses. Tax Ownership Change During the third quarter of 2009, we exchanged $1.7 billion principal amount of our interest bearing debt for an equal principal amount of non interest bearing convertible debentures. Subsequent to the Debt Exchange, $592.3 million and $720.9 million debentures were converted into 57.2 million and 69.7 million shares of common stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2009, respectively. As a result of these conversions, we believe we experienced a tax ownership change during the third quarter of 2009. As of the date of the ownership change, we had federal NOLs available to carryforward of approximately $1.4 billion. Section 382 imposes restrictions on the use of a corporations NOLs, certain recognized built in losses and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs. Section 382 rules governing when a change in ownership occurs are complex and subject to interpretation; however, an ownership change generally occurs when there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of a corporation by certain 5% shareholders of more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three year period. Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change NOLs. In general, the annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the corporations stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long term tax exempt rate. Any unused portion of the annual limitation is available for use in future years until such NOLs are scheduled to expire (in general, our NOLs may be carried forward 20 years). In addition, the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses, respectively, which may be present with respect to assets held at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period (one year for loans) after the ownership change. The use of NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected unless a corporation experienced an additional ownership change in a future period. We believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre ownership change NOLs, but will not limit the total amount of pre ownership change NOLs we can utilize. Our updated estimate is that we will be subject to an overall annual limitation on the use of our pre ownership change NOLs of approximately $194 million. Our overall pre ownership change NOLs, which were approximately $1.4 billion, have a statutory carryforward period of 20 years (the majority of which expire in 17 years). As a result, we believe we will be able to fully utilize these NOLs in future periods. Our ability to utilize the pre ownership change NOLs is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income over the duration of the carryforward periods and will not be impacted by our ability or inability to generate taxable income in an individual year. 2009 Compared to 2008 We incurred a net loss of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 due principally to the Debt Exchange that resulted in a non cash loss of $772.9 million (pre tax loss of $968.3 million) on early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of 2009. Our trading and investing segment income was $760.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. However, the provision for loan losses in our balance sheet management segment more than offset this strong performance, resulting in a consolidated loss before income taxes of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. 39 Table of Contents On April 1, 2009, we adopted the amended guidance for the recognition of OTTI for debt securities as well as the presentation of OTTI on the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the adoption, we recognized a $20.2 million after tax decrease to beginning accumulated deficit and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment represents the after tax difference between the impairment reported in prior periods for securities on our balance sheet as of April 1, 2009 and the level of impairment that would have been recorded on these same securities under the new accounting guidance. Additionally, in accordance with the new guidance, we changed the presentation of the consolidated statement of loss to state net impairment as a separate line item, as well as the credit and noncredit components of net impairment. Prior to this new presentation, OTTI was included in the gains (losses) on loans and securities, net line item on the consolidated statement of loss. Revenue The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2009 2008 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,260.6 $ 1,268.0 $ (7.4 ) (1 )% Commissions 548.0 515.5 32.5 6 % Fees and service charges 192.5 200.0 (7.5 ) (4 )% Principal transactions 88.1 84.9 3.2 4 % Gains (losses) on loans and securities, net 169.1 (100.5 ) 269.6 * Net impairment (89.1 ) (95.0 ) * * Other revenues 47.8 52.7 (4.9 ) (9 )% Total non interest income 956.4 657.6 298.8 45 % Total net revenue $ 2,217.0 $ 1,925.6 $ 291.4 15 % * Percentage not meaningful. Total net revenue increased 15% to $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This was driven by our gains (losses) on loans and securities, net, which increased from net losses of $100.5 million to net gains of $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Commissions also increased $32.5 million to $548.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 1% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The slight decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest earning assets of $2.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009, which was largely offset by an increase in our net operating interest spread during the same period. Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 5% to $44.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in our average loans portfolio and our average margin receivables, partially offset by an increase in average cash and equivalents. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 6% to $41.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in average FHLB advances, average brokered certificates of deposit and average securities loaned and other. 40 Table of Contents Enterprise net interest spread increased by 20 basis points to 2.72% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was largely driven by a decrease in the yields paid on our deposits and lower wholesale borrowing costs, partially offset by a decrease in higher yielding enterprise interest earning assets. Commissions Commissions increased 6% to $548.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Our DART volume increased 6% to 179,183 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Option related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 13% and 15% of trading volume for the years December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 14% and 11% of trading volume for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Average commission per trade increased 3% to $11.33 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in the average commission per trade for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to an improvement in product and customer mix compared to 2008. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 4% to $192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by a decrease in account service fee and advisory management fee revenue, which was partially offset by an increase in order flow revenue compared to 2008. The decrease in advisory management fees was primarily due to the sale of an advisor business in the second quarter of 2008. Declines in foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees also contributed to the decrease in fees and service charges. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 4% to $88.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in principal transactions was driven by an increase in the volume of equity shares that were traded, which was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue earned per share traded for the year ended December 31, 2009. Gains (Losses) on Loans and Securities, Net Gains (losses) on loans and securities, net were gains of $169.1 million and losses of $100.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2009 2008 Amount % Losses on sales of loans, net $ (12.5 ) $ (0.8 ) $ (11.7 ) 1496 % Gains on available for sale securities and other investments, net 173.2 32.4 140.8 435 % Gains (losses) on trading securities, net 7.8 (134.3 ) 142.1 * Hedge ineffectiveness 0.6 2.2 (1.6 ) (74 )% Gains (losses) on securities, net 181.6 (99.7 ) 281.3 * Gains (losses) on loans and securities, net $ 169.1 $ (100.5 ) $ 269.6 * * Percentage not meaningful. Gains on loans and securities, net for the year ended December 31, 2009, were due primarily to gains on the sale of certain agency mortgage backed securities, which were partially offset by net losses on the sales of loans. 41 Table of Contents Losses on the sales of loans were due to the sale of a $0.4 billion pool of home equity loans during the third quarter of 2009. Losses on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2008 were due primarily to losses on our preferred stock in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Net Impairment We recognized $89.1 million of net impairment during the year ended December 31, 2009, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. The net impairment included gross OTTI of $232.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Of the $232.1 million of gross OTTI for the year ended December 31, 2009, $143.0 million related to the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was recorded through other comprehensive income (loss). We had net impairment of $95.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which represented the total decline in the fair value of impaired securities in accordance with the OTTI accounting guidance that was in effect prior to April 1, 2009. Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 9% to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in other revenue was driven by lower employee stock option management fees from our corporate services business. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased $85.6 million to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 was due primarily to the high levels of delinquent loans in our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. Operating Expenses The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2009 2008 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 366.2 $ 383.4 $ (17.2 ) (4 )% Clearing and servicing 170.7 185.1 (14.4 ) (8 )% Advertising and market development 114.4 175.2 (60.8 ) (35 )% Professional services 78.7 94.1 (15.4 ) (16 )% FDIC insurance premiums 94.3 31.2 63.1 202 % Communications 84.4 96.8 (12.4 ) (13 )% Occupancy and equipment 78.4 85.8 (7.4 ) (9 )% Depreciation and amortization 83.3 82.5 0.8 1 % Amortization of other intangibles 29.7 35.7 (6.0 ) (17 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 20.7 29.5 (8.8 ) (30 )% Other operating expenses 122.5 90.9 31.6 35 % Total operating expense $ 1,243.3 $ 1,290.2 $ (46.9 ) (4 )% Operating expense decreased 4% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by decreases in the majority of the operating expense categories, offset by increases in FDIC insurance premiums and other operating expenses. 42 Table of Contents Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 4% to $366.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted primarily from lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base of 5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense decreased 35% to $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was due to high levels of advertising in the first half of 2008 that was aimed at restoring customer confidence as well as an overall decline in advertising rates in the year ended December 31, 2009. FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums increased 202% to $94.3 million for the year December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the ongoing FDIC insurance rates as well as an industry wide special assessment in the second quarter of 2009. Our portion of this special assessment was $21.6 million. Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities Facility restructuring and other exit activities were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These costs were due primarily to the restructuring of our international brokerage business. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased 35% to $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to a $23.7 million gain on the sale of our corporate aircraft related assets during the year ended December 31, 2008, which reduced other operating expenses during that period and to higher real estate owned expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to an expense of $330.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total other expense of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 was largely due to the $968.3 million pre tax non cash loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to our Debt Exchange. The loss on the Debt Exchange resulted from the de recognition of the debt that was exchanged and the corresponding recognition of the newly issued non interest bearing convertible debentures at fair value. Total other income (expense) also includes corporate interest expense resulting from our interest bearing corporate debt. Corporate interest expense decreased 22% to $282.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the reduction in interest bearing debt in connection with our Debt Exchange. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit from continuing operations was $537.7 million and $469.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rates were (29.3)% and (36.7)% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Debt Exchange The effective tax rate on the Debt Exchange of 20% was below our statutory federal tax rate of 35%. This was primarily due to certain components of the loss on the Debt Exchange not being deductible for tax purposes, which are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 Amount of Loss Tax Rate Tax Benefit Deductible portion of the loss on the Debt Exchange $ 723.0 35 % $ 253.0 Non deductible portion of the loss on the Debt Exchange 245.3 Prior period interest expense on the 12 1/2% Notes not deductible as a result of the Debt Exchange N/A N/A (57.7 ) Total $ 968.3 20 % $ 195.3 Valuation Allowance During the year ended December 31, 2009, we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as we believed that it was more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we were in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2009, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believed we were able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position.
