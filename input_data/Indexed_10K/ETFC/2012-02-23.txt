ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. GLOSSARY OF TERMS In analyzing and discussing our business, we utilize certain metrics, ratios and other terms that are defined in the Glossary of Terms, which is located at the end of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Strategy Our core business is our trading and investing customer franchise. Building on the strengths of this franchise, our growth strategy is focused on: Strengthening our overall financial and franchise position. We are focused on strengthening our overall capital structure and continuing to mitigate credit losses in our loan portfolio. We are also focused on positioning the Company for future growth and maintaining disciplined expense management. Improving our market position in our retail brokerage business. We plan to grow our customer base by continuing to increase our sales force, focus on long term investing and develop innovative products and services. Accelerating the growth of our corporate services and market making businesses. Our corporate services and market making businesses enhance our strategy by allowing us to realize additional economic benefit from our retail brokerage business. Enhancing our position with long term investors. We believe growing our investing and retirement products and services is key to our long term success. Our primary focus is to expand the reach of our brand along with the awareness of our products to this key customer segment. Optimizing the value of our bank franchise. Our retail brokerage business generates a significant amount of customer cash and we plan to continue to utilize our bank to optimize the value of these customer deposits. Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase; our ability to obtain regulatory approval to move capital from our bank to our parent company; and changes to the rules and regulations governing the financial services industry. 29 Table of Contents In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of trading customers; our ability to generate meaningful growth in the long term investing customer group; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; our ability to generate capital sufficient to meet our operating needs at both our bank and our parent company; our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For theYear Ended December 31, Variance 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 Customer Activity Metrics:(1) DARTs 157,475 150,532 179,183 5 % Average commission per trade $ 11.01 $ 11.21 $ 11.33 (2 )% Margin receivables (dollars in billions) $ 4.8 $ 5.1 $ 3.7 (6 )% End of period brokerage accounts 2,783,012 2,684,311 2,630,079 4 % Net new brokerage accounts 98,701 54,232 114,273 * Customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 172.4 $ 176.2 $ 150.5 (2 )% Net new brokerage assets (dollars in billions) $ 9.7 $ 8.1 $ 7.2 * Brokerage related cash (dollars in billions) $ 27.7 $ 24.5 $ 20.4 13 % Company Financial Metrics: Corporate cash (dollars in millions) $ 484.4 $ 470.5 $ 393.2 3 % E*TRADE Financial Tier I leverage ratio 5.7 % 3.6 % N/A 2.1 % E*TRADE Financial Tier I common ratio 9.4 % 4.8 % N/A 4.6 % E*TRADE Bank Tier I capital ratio 7.8 % 7.3 % 6.7 % 0.5 % Special mention loan delinquencies (dollars in millions) $ 467.1 $ 589.4 $ 804.5 (21 )% Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 822.8 $ 1,031.2 $ 1,182.7 (20 )% Enterprise net interest spread 2.79 % 2.91 % 2.72 % (0.12 )% Enterprise interest earning assets (average dollars in billions) $ 42.7 $ 41.1 $ 44.5 4 % * Percentage not meaningful. (1) The year ended December 31, 2009 presented has been updated to exclude international local market trading. Customer Activity Metrics DARTs are the predominant driver of commissions revenue from our customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. Margin receivables represent credit extended to customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they own. Margin receivables are a key driver of net operating interest income. End of period brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts are indicators of our ability to attract and retain brokerage customers. 30 Table of Contents Changes in customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new brokerage customers. Customer cash and deposits, particularly brokerage related cash, are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. Company Financial Metrics Corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company. It is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. E*TRADE Financial Tier I leverage ratio is Tier I capital divided by average total assets for the holding company for leverage capital purposes. E*TRADE Financial Tier I common ratio is Tier I capital less elements of Tier I capital that are not in the form of common equity, such as trust preferred securities, divided by total risk weighted assets for the holding company. The Tier I leverage and Tier I common ratios are non GAAP measures as the holding company is not yet held to these capital requirements. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of these non GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures. E*TRADE Bank Tier I capital ratio is Tier I capital divided by adjusted total assets for E*TRADE Bank and is an indication of E*TRADE Banks capital adequacy. Special mention loan delinquencies are loans 30 89 days past due and are an indicator of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off. Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to managements forecast of loan losses in the twelve months following the balance sheet date as well as the forecasted losses, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDR). See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in the allowance for loan losses. Enterprise interest earning assets, in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread, are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income.

Market Recognition Our corporate services business received top ratings in overall satisfaction and loyalty among broker plan administrators by Group Five, an independent consulting and research firm, in its 2011 Stock Plan Administration Benchmarking Study; and Our customer service team was awarded the 2011 International Service Excellence Award in the Contact Center category, based on a proven display of excellence, professionalism and outstanding service achievement. Issuance and Extinguishment of Senior Notes During the year, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $435 million in 6  3/4% senior notes due May 2016 (2016 Notes). We used the proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes due September 2013 (2013 Notes), including paying the associated redemption premium, accrued interest and related fees and expenses. Conversions of Convertible Debentures During the year, a total of $660.9 million in convertible debentures were converted into 63.9 million shares of common stock, increasing shareholders equity by $661 million. 32 Table of Contents Legal Settlements for the Auction Rate Securities and Freudenberg Matters We reached a settlement with the Colorado Division of Securities and the NASAA whereby E*TRADE Securities LLC offered to purchase auction rate securities from eligible investors who purchased those securities through E*TRADE Securities LLC. We recorded a reserve of $48 million in connection with this settlement. We also entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the Freudenberg Action, which resulted in the recording of a net reserve of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2011. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2011 Compared to 2010 We generated net income of $156.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, on total net revenue of $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue decreased 2% to $711.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, which was driven primarily by the elimination of all account activity fees, which took effect in the second quarter of 2010. In addition, gains on loans and securities, net and net impairment decreased 18% to $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Provision for loan losses declined 43% to $440.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, driven by improving credit trends and loan portfolio run off. Total operating expenses increased 8% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was driven primarily by increases in advertising and market development expense, FDIC insurance premiums and other operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that affected net revenue, provision for loan losses, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,220.0 $ 1,226.3 $ (6.3 ) (1 )% Commissions 436.2 431.0 5.2 1 % Fees and service charges 130.4 142.4 (12.0 ) (8 )% Principal transactions 105.4 103.4 2.0 2 % Gains on loans and securities, net 120.2 166.2 (46.0 ) (28 )% Net impairment (14.9 ) (37.7 ) 22.8 (60 )% Other revenues 39.3 46.3 (7.0 ) (15 )% Total non interest income 816.6 851.6 (35.0 ) (4 )% Total net revenue $ 2,036.6 $ 2,077.9 $ (41.3 ) (2 )% Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 1% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through investing customer cash and deposits in interest earning assets, which include: margin receivables, real estate loans, available for sale securities and held to maturity securities. The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (dollars in millions): 33 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 AverageBalance OperatingInterestInc./Exp.

Income on such nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. (2) Non operating interest earning and non interest earning assets consist of property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets that do not generate operating interest income. Some of these assets generate corporate interest income. (3) Non operating interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities consist of corporate debt and other liabilities that do not generate operating interest expense. Some of these liabilities generate corporate interest expense. (4) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.7 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, held by parties outside the Company, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. 34 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.79 % 2.91 % 2.72 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.84 % 2.96 % 2.80 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 106.51 % 106.49 % 106.36 % Return on average: Total assets 0.33 % (0.06 )% (2.68 )% Total shareholders equity 3.36 % (0.71 )% (43.61 )% Average equity to average total assets 9.91 % 8.84 % 6.15 % The fluctuation in enterprise interest earning assets is driven primarily by changes in enterprise interest earning liabilities, specifically customer cash and deposits. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 4% to $42.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This was primarily a result of the increases in average margin receivables and average available for sale and held to maturity securities, offset by decreases in average loans and average cash and equivalents. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 4% to $40.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to increases in average sweep deposits and average customer payables, offset by a decrease in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 12 basis points to 2.79% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting yields on average enterprise interest earning assets and the current interest rate environment. We expect enterprise net interest spread to continue to compress and, given the continued challenges of the current interest rate environment, our enterprise net interest spread could average less than 2.50% for the year ending December 31, 2012. Commissions Commissions revenue increased 1% to $436.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The main factors that affect commissions are DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days during the period. Average commission per trade is impacted by different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, stock plan, exchange traded funds, mutual funds and cross border) that can have different commission rates. Accordingly, changes in the mix of trade types will impact average commission per trade. 35 Table of Contents DART volume increased 5% to 157,475 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Option related DARTs as a percentage of total DARTs represented 21% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 17% in 2010. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of total DARTs represented 11% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 10% in 2010. Average commission per trade decreased 2% to $11.01 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was driven by a change in the customer mix; specifically customers who have a higher commission per trade traded less during the year compared to our active trader customers, who generally have lower commission per trade, when compared to 2010. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 8% to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the elimination of all account activity fees, which took effect in the second quarter of 2010. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 2% to $105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Principal transactions are derived from our market making business in which we act as a market maker for our brokerage customers orders as well as orders from third party customers. The increase in principal transactions revenue was driven by a favorable mix of trading volume and revenue earned per share, as well as a continued focus on expanding our external customer base, when compared to 2010. Gains on Loans and Securities, Net Gains on loans and securities, net were $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $166.2 million in 2010, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Year Ended Variance December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Gains on loans, net $ 0.1 $ 6.3 $ (6.2 ) * Gains on available for sale securities, net 124.4 160.7 (36.3 ) (23 )% Gains (losses) on trading securities, net (1.9 ) 0.2 (2.1 ) * Hedge ineffectiveness (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.4 ) * Gains on securities, net 120.1 159.9 (39.8 ) (25 )% Gains on loans and securities, net $ 120.2 $ 166.2 $ (46.0 ) (28 )% * Percentage not meaningful. The decrease of 28% to $120.2 million in gains on loans and securities, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, was primarily due to more trading volatility in 2010 when compared to 2011. 36 Table of Contents Net Impairment We recognized $14.9 million of net impairment during the year ended December 31, 2011, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in those specific securities. The gross other than temporary impairment (OTTI) and the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income, are shown in the table below (dollars in millions): Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) $ (9.2 ) $ (41.5 ) Less: noncredit portion of OTTI recognized into (out of)other comprehensive income (loss) (before tax) (5.7 ) 3.8 Net impairment $ (14.9) $ (37.7 ) Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 15% to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was due primarily to the gain on sale of approximately $1 billion in savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in the first quarter of 2010, which increased other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 43% to $440.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease in provision for loan losses was driven by improving credit trends and loan portfolio run off, as evidenced by the lower levels of delinquent loans in the one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. The provision for loan losses has declined for three consecutive years, down 72% from its peak of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. We expect provision for loan losses to continue to decline in 2012 compared to 2011, although it is subject to variability from quarter to quarter. As we transition from the OTS to the OCC, we are evaluating programs and practices that were designed in accordance with guidance from the OTS. We are working to align certain policies and procedures to the guidance from the OCC and have suspended certain loan modification programs that will require changes. We increased the qualitative reserve in 2011 to reflect additional estimated losses during the period of reduced activity in our modification programs, as well as uncertainty around certain loans modified under our previous programs. Once the evaluation of the existing programs and practices is complete and any necessary changes have been implemented, we will re assess the overall qualitative reserve. 37 Table of Contents Operating Expense The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended Variance December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 333.6 $ 325.0 $ 8.6 3 % Clearing and servicing 147.1 147.5 (0.4 ) (0 )% Advertising and market development 145.2 132.2 13.0 10 % FDIC insurance premiums 105.4 77.7 27.7 36 % Professional services 89.7 81.2 8.5 10 % Occupancy and equipment 68.8 70.9 (2.1 ) (3 )% Communications 67.3 73.3 (6.0 ) (8 )% Depreciation and amortization 89.6 87.9 1.7 2 % Amortization of other intangibles 26.2 28.5 (2.3 ) (8 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 7.7 14.4 (6.7 ) * Other operating expenses 154.3 104.0 50.3 48 % Total operating expense $ 1,234.9 $ 1,142.6 $ 92.3 8 % * Percentage not meaningful. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 3% to $333.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase resulted primarily from higher compensation expense as a result of increasing our financial consultants by 42%, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 10% to $145.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This fluctuation was due largely to the planned increase in advertising expenditures in our continuing effort to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended December 31, 2011. FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums increased 36% to $105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due primarily to an industry wide change in the FDIC insurance premium assessment calculation, effective in the second quarter of 2011. Professional Services Professional services increased 10% to $89.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due primarily to a $6.0 million credit in connection with a legal settlement in the third quarter of 2010, which decreased professional services for the year ended December 31, 2010. There were no similar settlements made during the year ended December 31, 2011. Communications Communications expense decreased 8% to $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in vendor services fees compared to 2010. 38 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased 48% to $154.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was driven by a reserve of $48 million related to an offer to purchase auction rate securities held by customers of E*TRADE Securities LLC, as well as former customers who purchased auction rate securities through E*TRADE Securities LLC. This reserve relates primarily to our estimate of the securities current fair value relative to their par value and includes penalties and other estimated settlement costs. We also entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the Freudenberg Action, which resulted in the recording of a net reserve of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased 11% to $175.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Year Ended Variance December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Corporate interest income $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ (5.5 ) (89 )% Corporate interest expense (177.8 ) (167.1 ) (10.7 ) 6 % Gains on sales of investments, net 2.7 (2.7 ) * Gains on early extinguishment of debt 3.1 3.1 * Equity in loss of investments and venture funds (1.8 ) (0.8 ) (1.0 ) * Total other income (expense) $ (175.8 ) $ (159.0 ) $ (16.8 ) 11 % * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) primarily consisted of corporate interest expense on interest bearing corporate debt for the year ended December 31, 2011. Corporate interest expense increased 6% to $177.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. In addition to the stated interest on corporate debt, the corporate interest expense line item included the benefit of discontinued fair value hedges on corporate debt, which decreased $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Offsetting interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a $3.1 million gain on early extinguishment of debt related to the call of the 2013 Notes in the second quarter of 2011. Offsetting corporate interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a benefit of $6.0 million related to a legal settlement. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $25.3 million in 2010. The effective tax rate was 15.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 806.3% in 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, we recorded an income tax benefit of $61.7 million related to the taxable liquidation of a European subsidiary. The subsidiary was liquidated for U.S. tax purposes in connection with our international restructuring activities. This liquidation resulted in the taxable recognition of certain losses, including historical acquisition premiums that we incurred internationally. This tax benefit resulted in a corresponding increase to the deferred tax assets, which were $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our reported pre tax loss was relatively close to breakeven, which resulted in an unusually high effective tax rate. Valuation Allowance We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we did conclude that a valuation 39 Table of Contents allowance was required, the resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2011, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of the deferred tax assets in the future. However, we did not establish a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Approximately two thirds of existing federal deferred tax assets are not related to net operating losses and therefore, have no expiration date. We expect to utilize the vast majority of the existing federal deferred tax assets over the next seven years, with a small balance remaining as a result of the current limitation caused by the ownership change (which is expected to be fully utilized in advance of the statutory carry forward period). Our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future. We determined that our expectations regarding future earnings are objectively verifiable due to various factors. One factor is the consistent profitability of the core business, the trading and investing segment, which has generated substantial income for each of the last eight years, including through uncertain economic and regulatory environments. The core business is driven by brokerage customer activity and includes trading, brokerage cash, margin lending, long term investing and other brokerage related activities. These activities drive variable expenses that correlate to the volume of customer activity, which has resulted in stable, ongoing profitability in this business. Another factor is the mitigation of losses in the balance sheet management segment, which generated a large net operating loss in 2007 caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Much of this loss came from the sale of the asset backed securities portfolio and credit losses from the mortgage loan portfolio. We no longer hold any of those asset backed securities and shut down mortgage loan acquisition activities in 2007. In effect, the key business activities that led to the generation of the deferred tax assets were shut down over four years ago. As a result, the losses in the balance sheet management segment have continued to decline significantly. In addition, we continue to realize the benefit of various credit loss mitigation activities for the mortgage loans purchased in 2007 and prior, most notably, actively reducing or closing unused home equity lines of credit and aggressively exercising put back clauses to sell back improperly documented loans to the originators. As a result of these loss containment measures, provision for loan losses has declined for three consecutive years, down 72% from its peak of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. We maintain a valuation allowance for certain of our state deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. At December 31, 2011, we had state deferred tax assets of approximately $102.1 million that related to our state net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences with a valuation allowance of $28.7 million against such deferred tax assets. Tax Ownership Change During the third quarter of 2009, we exchanged $1.7 billion principal amount of interest bearing debt for an equal principal amount of non interest bearing convertible debentures. Subsequent to the Debt Exchange, $592.3 million and $128.7 million debentures were converted into 57.2 million and 12.5 million shares of common stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2009, respectively. As a result of these conversions, we believe we experienced a tax ownership change during the third quarter of 2009. As of the date of the ownership change, we had federal NOLs available to carry forward of approximately $1.4 billion. Section 382 imposes restrictions on the use of a corporations NOLs, certain recognized built in losses and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs. Section 382 rules governing when a change in ownership occurs are complex and subject to interpretation; however, an ownership change generally occurs when there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of a corporation by certain 5% shareholders of more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three year period. 40 Table of Contents Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change NOLs. In general, the annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the corporations stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long term tax exempt rate. Any unused portion of the annual limitation is available for use in future years until such NOLs are scheduled to expire (in general, NOLs may be carried forward 20 years). In addition, the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses, respectively, which may be present with respect to assets held at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period (one year for loans) after the ownership change. The use of NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected unless a corporation experienced an additional ownership change in a future period. We believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre ownership change NOLs, but will not limit the total amount of pre ownership change NOLs we can utilize. Our updated estimate is that we will be subject to an overall annual limitation on the use of our pre ownership change NOLs of approximately $194 million. The overall pre ownership change NOLs, which were approximately $1.4 billion, have a statutory carry forward period of 20 years (the majority of which expire in 16 years). As a result, we believe we will be able to fully utilize these NOLs in future periods. Our ability to utilize the pre ownership change NOLs is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income over the duration of the carry forward periods and will not be impacted by our ability or inability to generate taxable income in an individual year. 2010 Compared to 2009 We incurred a net loss of $28.5 million, or $(0.13) per diluted share, on total revenue of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue decreased 17% to $723.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, which was driven by a decrease in commissions. Provision for loan losses declined 48% to $779.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, driven by improving credit trends and loan portfolio run off. Total operating expense decreased 8% to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by decreases in majority of the operating expense categories, offset by a planned increase in advertising and market development expense. 41 Table of Contents The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that affected net revenue, provision for loan losses, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,226.3 $ 1,260.6 $ (34.3 ) (3 )% Commissions 431.0 548.0 (117.0 ) (21 )% Fees and service charges 142.4 192.5 (50.1 ) (26 )% Principal transactions 103.4 88.1 15.3 17 % Gains on loans and securities, net 166.2 169.1 (2.9 ) (2 )% Net impairment (37.7 ) (89.1 ) * * Other revenues 46.3 47.8 (1.5 ) (3 )% Total non interest income 851.6 956.4 (104.8 ) (11 )% Total net revenue $ 2,077.9 $ 2,217.0 $ (139.1 ) (6 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 3% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The slight decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest earning assets of $3.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, which was offset by an increase in our net operating interest spread during the same period. Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 8% to $41.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in our average loans portfolio, average available for sale mortgage backed securities and average cash and equivalents, partially offset by an increase in average margin receivables, average available for sale and held to maturity securities. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 8% to $38.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to decreases in average complete savings deposits and average certificates of deposit offset by an increase in average sweep deposits. Enterprise net interest spread increased by 19 basis points to 2.91% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was largely driven by a decrease in the yields paid on our deposits and lower wholesale borrowing costs, partially offset by a decrease in higher yielding enterprise interest earning assets. Commissions Commissions decreased 21% to $431.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Our DART volume decreased 16% to 150,532 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. Option related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 17% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13% in 2009. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of total DARTs represented 10% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 14% in 2009. 42 Table of Contents Average commission per trade decreased 1% to $11.21 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The slight decrease in the average commission per trade was due primarily to the elimination of the $12.99 commission tier and the per share commission applied to market trades larger than 2,000 shares, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by an improvement in the product and customer mix when compared to 2009. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 26% to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination of all account activity fees, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, and lower order flow revenue. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 17% to $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in principal transactions was driven by an increase in the volume of orders from our third party customers which was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue earned per share traded when compared to 2009. Gains on Loans and Securities, Net Gains on loans and securities, net were $166.2 million and $169.1 million for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Gains (losses) on loans, net $ 6.3 $ (12.5 ) $ 18.8 * Gains on available for sale securities, net 160.7 173.2 (12.5 ) (7 )% Gains on trading securities, net 0.2 7.8 (7.6 ) (98 )% Hedge ineffectiveness (1.0 ) 0.6 (1.6 ) * Gains on securities, net 159.9 181.6 (21.7 ) (12 )% Gains on loans and securities, net $ 166.2 $ 169.1 $ (2.9 ) (2 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Net Impairment We recognized $37.7 million and $89.1 million of net impairment during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. The gross OTTI and the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income (loss), are shown in the table below (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) $ (41.5 ) $ (232.1 ) Less: noncredit portion of OTTI recognized into other comprehensive income (loss) (before tax) 3.8 143.0 Net impairment $ (37.7 ) $ (89.1 ) 43 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 3% to $46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due to a decline in the income from the cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance, partially offset by the gain on the sale of approximately $1 billion in savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in the first quarter of 2010. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 48% to $779.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was driven by lower levels of delinquent loans in our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. Operating Expense The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 325.0 $ 366.2 $ (41.2 ) (11 )% Clearing and servicing 147.5 170.7 (23.2 ) (14 )% Advertising and market development 132.2 114.4 17.8 16 % FDIC insurance premiums 77.7 94.3 (16.6 ) (18 )% Professional services 81.2 78.7 2.5 3 % Occupancy and equipment 70.9 78.4 (7.5 ) (10 )% Communications 73.3 84.4 (11.1 ) (13 )% Depreciation and amortization 87.9 83.3 4.6 6 % Amortization of other intangibles 28.5 29.7 (1.2 ) (4 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 14.4 20.7 (6.3 ) * Other operating expenses 104.0 122.5 (18.5 ) (15 )% Total operating expense $ 1,142.6 $ 1,243.3 $ (100.7 ) (8 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 11% to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted from lower incentive compensation expense and lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base compared to 2009. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense decreased 14% to $147.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted primarily from lower trading volumes and lower loan balances compared to 2009. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 16% to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This fluctuation was due largely to a planned increase in advertising expense to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended December 31, 2010. FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums decreased 18% to $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due primarily to an industry wide special assessment that resulted in an additional 44 Table of Contents $21.6 million of expense in the second quarter of 2009. There were no similar assessments made during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased 15% to $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in bad debt expense, real estate owned and legal reserves compared to 2009. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $159.0 million and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount Variance Corporate interest income $ 6.2 $ 0.9 $ 5.3 620 % Corporate interest expense (167.1 ) (282.7 ) 115.6 (41 )% Gains (losses) on sales of investments, net 2.7 (1.7 ) 4.4 * Losses on early extinguishment of debt (1,018.9 ) 1,018.9 * Equity in loss of investments and venture funds (0.8 ) (8.6 ) 7.8 (91 )% Total other income (expense) $ (159.0 ) $ (1,311.0 ) $ 1,152.0 (88 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from our interest bearing corporate debt. Corporate interest expense decreased 41% to $167.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This was due to the reduction in interest bearing debt in connection with our Debt Exchange in 2009. The losses on early extinguishment of debt of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 were related primarily to the Debt Exchange. The loss on the Debt Exchange resulted from de recognition of the debt that was exchanged and the corresponding recognition of the newly issued non interest bearing convertible debentures at fair value. Corporate interest income increased to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009 due to a benefit of $6.0 million in connection with a legal settlement. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a benefit of $537.7 million in 2009. Our effective tax rate was 806.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to (29.3)% in 2009. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was higher than in 2009 for two reasons: 1) our pre tax loss included items not deductible for tax purposes, predominantly about one third of the interest expense on the 2017 Notes; and 2) our reported pre tax loss is relatively close to breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result, our income subject to taxation was higher, resulting in an unusually high effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. Valuation Allowance During the year ended December 31, 2010, we did not maintain a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets as we believed that it was more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognized that we were in a cumulative book loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2010, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believed we were able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. 45 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW We report operating results in two segments: 1) trading and investing; and 2) balance sheet management. Trading and investing includes retail brokerage products and services; investor focused banking products; market making; and corporate services. Balance sheet management includes the management of asset allocation and credit, liquidity and interest rate risk; loans previously originated or purchased from third parties; and customer cash and deposits. Costs associated with certain functions that are centrally managed are separately reported in a corporate/other category. For more information on our segments, see Note 22 Segment Information in

Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: customer demand for financial products and services; weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets; performance, volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets; customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise; market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities; market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase; our ability to obtain regulatory approval to move capital from our bank to our parent company; and changes to the rules and regulations governing the financial services industry. 29 Table of Contents In addition to the items noted above, our success in the future will depend upon, among other things: continuing our success in the acquisition, growth and retention of trading customers; our ability to generate meaningful growth in the long term investing customer group; our ability to assess and manage credit risk; our ability to generate capital sufficient to meet our operating needs at both our bank and our parent company; our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk; and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency. Management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the Companys performance. The most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below: As of or For theYear Ended December 31, Variance 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 Customer Activity Metrics:(1) DARTs 157,475 150,532 179,183 5 % Average commission per trade $ 11.01 $ 11.21 $ 11.33 (2 )% Margin receivables (dollars in billions) $ 4.8 $ 5.1 $ 3.7 (6 )% End of period brokerage accounts 2,783,012 2,684,311 2,630,079 4 % Net new brokerage accounts 98,701 54,232 114,273 * Customer assets (dollars in billions) $ 172.4 $ 176.2 $ 150.5 (2 )% Net new brokerage assets (dollars in billions) $ 9.7 $ 8.1 $ 7.2 * Brokerage related cash (dollars in billions) $ 27.7 $ 24.5 $ 20.4 13 % Company Financial Metrics: Corporate cash (dollars in millions) $ 484.4 $ 470.5 $ 393.2 3 % E*TRADE Financial Tier I leverage ratio 5.7 % 3.6 % N/A 2.1 % E*TRADE Financial Tier I common ratio 9.4 % 4.8 % N/A 4.6 % E*TRADE Bank Tier I capital ratio 7.8 % 7.3 % 6.7 % 0.5 % Special mention loan delinquencies (dollars in millions) $ 467.1 $ 589.4 $ 804.5 (21 )% Allowance for loan losses (dollars in millions) $ 822.8 $ 1,031.2 $ 1,182.7 (20 )% Enterprise net interest spread 2.79 % 2.91 % 2.72 % (0.12 )% Enterprise interest earning assets (average dollars in billions) $ 42.7 $ 41.1 $ 44.5 4 % * Percentage not meaningful. (1) The year ended December 31, 2009 presented has been updated to exclude international local market trading. Customer Activity Metrics DARTs are the predominant driver of commissions revenue from our customers. Average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix, product mix and or product pricing. Margin receivables represent credit extended to customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they own. Margin receivables are a key driver of net operating interest income. End of period brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts are indicators of our ability to attract and retain brokerage customers. 30 Table of Contents Changes in customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase in customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities. Net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new brokerage customers. Customer cash and deposits, particularly brokerage related cash, are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income. Company Financial Metrics Corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company. It is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. E*TRADE Financial Tier I leverage ratio is Tier I capital divided by average total assets for the holding company for leverage capital purposes. E*TRADE Financial Tier I common ratio is Tier I capital less elements of Tier I capital that are not in the form of common equity, such as trust preferred securities, divided by total risk weighted assets for the holding company. The Tier I leverage and Tier I common ratios are non GAAP measures as the holding company is not yet held to these capital requirements. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of these non GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures. E*TRADE Bank Tier I capital ratio is Tier I capital divided by adjusted total assets for E*TRADE Bank and is an indication of E*TRADE Banks capital adequacy. Special mention loan delinquencies are loans 30 89 days past due and are an indicator of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off. Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to managements forecast of loan losses in the twelve months following the balance sheet date as well as the forecasted losses, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDR). See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in the allowance for loan losses.

Conversions of Convertible Debentures During the year, a total of $660.9 million in convertible debentures were converted into 63.9 million shares of common stock, increasing shareholders equity by $661 million. 32 Table of Contents Legal Settlements for the Auction Rate Securities and Freudenberg Matters We reached a settlement with the Colorado Division of Securities and the NASAA whereby E*TRADE Securities LLC offered to purchase auction rate securities from eligible investors who purchased those securities through E*TRADE Securities LLC. We recorded a reserve of $48 million in connection with this settlement. We also entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the Freudenberg Action, which resulted in the recording of a net reserve of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2011. EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2011 Compared to 2010 We generated net income of $156.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, on total net revenue of $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue decreased 2% to $711.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, which was driven primarily by the elimination of all account activity fees, which took effect in the second quarter of 2010. In addition, gains on loans and securities, net and net impairment decreased 18% to $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Provision for loan losses declined 43% to $440.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, driven by improving credit trends and loan portfolio run off. Total operating expenses increased 8% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was driven primarily by increases in advertising and market development expense, FDIC insurance premiums and other operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011. The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that affected net revenue, provision for loan losses, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,220.0 $ 1,226.3 $ (6.3 ) (1 )% Commissions 436.2 431.0 5.2 1 % Fees and service charges 130.4 142.4 (12.0 ) (8 )% Principal transactions 105.4 103.4 2.0 2 % Gains on loans and securities, net 120.2 166.2 (46.0 ) (28 )% Net impairment (14.9 ) (37.7 ) 22.8 (60 )% Other revenues 39.3 46.3 (7.0 ) (15 )% Total non interest income 816.6 851.6 (35.0 ) (4 )% Total net revenue $ 2,036.6 $ 2,077.9 $ (41.3 ) (2 )% Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 1% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through investing customer cash and deposits in interest earning assets, which include: margin receivables, real estate loans, available for sale securities and held to maturity securities.

Income on such nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. (2) Non operating interest earning and non interest earning assets consist of property and equipment, net, goodwill, other intangibles, net and other assets that do not generate operating interest income. Some of these assets generate corporate interest income. (3) Non operating interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities consist of corporate debt and other liabilities that do not generate operating interest expense. Some of these liabilities generate corporate interest expense. (4) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.7 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, held by parties outside the Company, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. 34 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Enterprise net interest: Spread 2.79 % 2.91 % 2.72 % Margin (net yield on interest earning assets) 2.84 % 2.96 % 2.80 % Ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities 106.51 % 106.49 % 106.36 % Return on average: Total assets 0.33 % (0.06 )% (2.68 )% Total shareholders equity 3.36 % (0.71 )% (43.61 )% Average equity to average total assets 9.91 % 8.84 % 6.15 % The fluctuation in enterprise interest earning assets is driven primarily by changes in enterprise interest earning liabilities, specifically customer cash and deposits. Average enterprise interest earning assets increased 4% to $42.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This was primarily a result of the increases in average margin receivables and average available for sale and held to maturity securities, offset by decreases in average loans and average cash and equivalents. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased 4% to $40.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to increases in average sweep deposits and average customer payables, offset by a decrease in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 12 basis points to 2.79% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting yields on average enterprise interest earning assets and the current interest rate environment. We expect enterprise net interest spread to continue to compress and, given the continued challenges of the current interest rate environment, our enterprise net interest spread could average less than 2.50% for the year ending December 31, 2012. Commissions Commissions revenue increased 1% to $436.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The main factors that affect commissions are DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days during the period. Average commission per trade is impacted by different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, stock plan, exchange traded funds, mutual funds and cross border) that can have different commission rates. Accordingly, changes in the mix of trade types will impact average commission per trade. 35 Table of Contents DART volume increased 5% to 157,475 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Option related DARTs as a percentage of total DARTs represented 21% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 17% in 2010. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of total DARTs represented 11% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 10% in 2010. Average commission per trade decreased 2% to $11.01 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was driven by a change in the customer mix; specifically customers who have a higher commission per trade traded less during the year compared to our active trader customers, who generally have lower commission per trade, when compared to 2010. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 8% to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the elimination of all account activity fees, which took effect in the second quarter of 2010. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 2% to $105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Principal transactions are derived from our market making business in which we act as a market maker for our brokerage customers orders as well as orders from third party customers. The increase in principal transactions revenue was driven by a favorable mix of trading volume and revenue earned per share, as well as a continued focus on expanding our external customer base, when compared to 2010. Gains on Loans and Securities, Net Gains on loans and securities, net were $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $166.2 million in 2010, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Year Ended Variance December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Gains on loans, net $ 0.1 $ 6.3 $ (6.2 ) * Gains on available for sale securities, net 124.4 160.7 (36.3 ) (23 )% Gains (losses) on trading securities, net (1.9 ) 0.2 (2.1 ) * Hedge ineffectiveness (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.4 ) * Gains on securities, net 120.1 159.9 (39.8 ) (25 )% Gains on loans and securities, net $ 120.2 $ 166.2 $ (46.0 ) (28 )% * Percentage not meaningful. The decrease of 28% to $120.2 million in gains on loans and securities, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, was primarily due to more trading volatility in 2010 when compared to 2011. 36 Table of Contents Net Impairment We recognized $14.9 million of net impairment during the year ended December 31, 2011, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in those specific securities. The gross other than temporary impairment (OTTI) and the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income, are shown in the table below (dollars in millions): Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) $ (9.2 ) $ (41.5 ) Less: noncredit portion of OTTI recognized into (out of)other comprehensive income (loss) (before tax) (5.7 ) 3.8 Net impairment $ (14.9) $ (37.7 ) Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 15% to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was due primarily to the gain on sale of approximately $1 billion in savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in the first quarter of 2010, which increased other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 43% to $440.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease in provision for loan losses was driven by improving credit trends and loan portfolio run off, as evidenced by the lower levels of delinquent loans in the one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. The provision for loan losses has declined for three consecutive years, down 72% from its peak of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. We expect provision for loan losses to continue to decline in 2012 compared to 2011, although it is subject to variability from quarter to quarter. As we transition from the OTS to the OCC, we are evaluating programs and practices that were designed in accordance with guidance from the OTS. We are working to align certain policies and procedures to the guidance from the OCC and have suspended certain loan modification programs that will require changes. We increased the qualitative reserve in 2011 to reflect additional estimated losses during the period of reduced activity in our modification programs, as well as uncertainty around certain loans modified under our previous programs. Once the evaluation of the existing programs and practices is complete and any necessary changes have been implemented, we will re assess the overall qualitative reserve. 37 Table of Contents Operating Expense The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended Variance December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 333.6 $ 325.0 $ 8.6 3 % Clearing and servicing 147.1 147.5 (0.4 ) (0 )% Advertising and market development 145.2 132.2 13.0 10 % FDIC insurance premiums 105.4 77.7 27.7 36 % Professional services 89.7 81.2 8.5 10 % Occupancy and equipment 68.8 70.9 (2.1 ) (3 )% Communications 67.3 73.3 (6.0 ) (8 )% Depreciation and amortization 89.6 87.9 1.7 2 % Amortization of other intangibles 26.2 28.5 (2.3 ) (8 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 7.7 14.4 (6.7 ) * Other operating expenses 154.3 104.0 50.3 48 % Total operating expense $ 1,234.9 $ 1,142.6 $ 92.3 8 % * Percentage not meaningful. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits increased 3% to $333.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase resulted primarily from higher compensation expense as a result of increasing our financial consultants by 42%, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 10% to $145.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This fluctuation was due largely to the planned increase in advertising expenditures in our continuing effort to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended December 31, 2011. FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums increased 36% to $105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due primarily to an industry wide change in the FDIC insurance premium assessment calculation, effective in the second quarter of 2011. Professional Services Professional services increased 10% to $89.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due primarily to a $6.0 million credit in connection with a legal settlement in the third quarter of 2010, which decreased professional services for the year ended December 31, 2010. There were no similar settlements made during the year ended December 31, 2011. Communications Communications expense decreased 8% to $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in vendor services fees compared to 2010. 38 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased 48% to $154.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was driven by a reserve of $48 million related to an offer to purchase auction rate securities held by customers of E*TRADE Securities LLC, as well as former customers who purchased auction rate securities through E*TRADE Securities LLC. This reserve relates primarily to our estimate of the securities current fair value relative to their par value and includes penalties and other estimated settlement costs. We also entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the Freudenberg Action, which resulted in the recording of a net reserve of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) increased 11% to $175.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Year Ended Variance December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2011 2010 Amount % Corporate interest income $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ (5.5 ) (89 )% Corporate interest expense (177.8 ) (167.1 ) (10.7 ) 6 % Gains on sales of investments, net 2.7 (2.7 ) * Gains on early extinguishment of debt 3.1 3.1 * Equity in loss of investments and venture funds (1.8 ) (0.8 ) (1.0 ) * Total other income (expense) $ (175.8 ) $ (159.0 ) $ (16.8 ) 11 % * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) primarily consisted of corporate interest expense on interest bearing corporate debt for the year ended December 31, 2011. Corporate interest expense increased 6% to $177.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. In addition to the stated interest on corporate debt, the corporate interest expense line item included the benefit of discontinued fair value hedges on corporate debt, which decreased $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Offsetting interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a $3.1 million gain on early extinguishment of debt related to the call of the 2013 Notes in the second quarter of 2011. Offsetting corporate interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a benefit of $6.0 million related to a legal settlement. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $25.3 million in 2010. The effective tax rate was 15.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 806.3% in 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, we recorded an income tax benefit of $61.7 million related to the taxable liquidation of a European subsidiary. The subsidiary was liquidated for U.S. tax purposes in connection with our international restructuring activities. This liquidation resulted in the taxable recognition of certain losses, including historical acquisition premiums that we incurred internationally. This tax benefit resulted in a corresponding increase to the deferred tax assets, which were $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our reported pre tax loss was relatively close to breakeven, which resulted in an unusually high effective tax rate. Valuation Allowance We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we did conclude that a valuation 39 Table of Contents allowance was required, the resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2011, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of the deferred tax assets in the future. However, we did not establish a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Approximately two thirds of existing federal deferred tax assets are not related to net operating losses and therefore, have no expiration date. We expect to utilize the vast majority of the existing federal deferred tax assets over the next seven years, with a small balance remaining as a result of the current limitation caused by the ownership change (which is expected to be fully utilized in advance of the statutory carry forward period). Our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future. We determined that our expectations regarding future earnings are objectively verifiable due to various factors. One factor is the consistent profitability of the core business, the trading and investing segment, which has generated substantial income for each of the last eight years, including through uncertain economic and regulatory environments. The core business is driven by brokerage customer activity and includes trading, brokerage cash, margin lending, long term investing and other brokerage related activities. These activities drive variable expenses that correlate to the volume of customer activity, which has resulted in stable, ongoing profitability in this business. Another factor is the mitigation of losses in the balance sheet management segment, which generated a large net operating loss in 2007 caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Much of this loss came from the sale of the asset backed securities portfolio and credit losses from the mortgage loan portfolio. We no longer hold any of those asset backed securities and shut down mortgage loan acquisition activities in 2007. In effect, the key business activities that led to the generation of the deferred tax assets were shut down over four years ago. As a result, the losses in the balance sheet management segment have continued to decline significantly. In addition, we continue to realize the benefit of various credit loss mitigation activities for the mortgage loans purchased in 2007 and prior, most notably, actively reducing or closing unused home equity lines of credit and aggressively exercising put back clauses to sell back improperly documented loans to the originators. As a result of these loss containment measures, provision for loan losses has declined for three consecutive years, down 72% from its peak of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. We maintain a valuation allowance for certain of our state deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. At December 31, 2011, we had state deferred tax assets of approximately $102.1 million that related to our state net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences with a valuation allowance of $28.7 million against such deferred tax assets. Tax Ownership Change During the third quarter of 2009, we exchanged $1.7 billion principal amount of interest bearing debt for an equal principal amount of non interest bearing convertible debentures. Subsequent to the Debt Exchange, $592.3 million and $128.7 million debentures were converted into 57.2 million and 12.5 million shares of common stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2009, respectively. As a result of these conversions, we believe we experienced a tax ownership change during the third quarter of 2009. As of the date of the ownership change, we had federal NOLs available to carry forward of approximately $1.4 billion. Section 382 imposes restrictions on the use of a corporations NOLs, certain recognized built in losses and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs. Section 382 rules governing when a change in ownership occurs are complex and subject to interpretation; however, an ownership change generally occurs when there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of a corporation by certain 5% shareholders of more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three year period. 40 Table of Contents Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change NOLs. In general, the annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the corporations stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long term tax exempt rate. Any unused portion of the annual limitation is available for use in future years until such NOLs are scheduled to expire (in general, NOLs may be carried forward 20 years). In addition, the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses, respectively, which may be present with respect to assets held at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period (one year for loans) after the ownership change. The use of NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected unless a corporation experienced an additional ownership change in a future period. We believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre ownership change NOLs, but will not limit the total amount of pre ownership change NOLs we can utilize. Our updated estimate is that we will be subject to an overall annual limitation on the use of our pre ownership change NOLs of approximately $194 million. The overall pre ownership change NOLs, which were approximately $1.4 billion, have a statutory carry forward period of 20 years (the majority of which expire in 16 years). As a result, we believe we will be able to fully utilize these NOLs in future periods. Our ability to utilize the pre ownership change NOLs is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income over the duration of the carry forward periods and will not be impacted by our ability or inability to generate taxable income in an individual year. 2010 Compared to 2009 We incurred a net loss of $28.5 million, or $(0.13) per diluted share, on total revenue of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue decreased 17% to $723.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, which was driven by a decrease in commissions. Provision for loan losses declined 48% to $779.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, driven by improving credit trends and loan portfolio run off. Total operating expense decreased 8% to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by decreases in majority of the operating expense categories, offset by a planned increase in advertising and market development expense. 41 Table of Contents The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that affected net revenue, provision for loan losses, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit). Revenue The components of revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Net operating interest income $ 1,226.3 $ 1,260.6 $ (34.3 ) (3 )% Commissions 431.0 548.0 (117.0 ) (21 )% Fees and service charges 142.4 192.5 (50.1 ) (26 )% Principal transactions 103.4 88.1 15.3 17 % Gains on loans and securities, net 166.2 169.1 (2.9 ) (2 )% Net impairment (37.7 ) (89.1 ) * * Other revenues 46.3 47.8 (1.5 ) (3 )% Total non interest income 851.6 956.4 (104.8 ) (11 )% Total net revenue $ 2,077.9 $ 2,217.0 $ (139.1 ) (6 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Net Operating Interest Income Net operating interest income decreased 3% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The slight decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest earning assets of $3.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, which was offset by an increase in our net operating interest spread during the same period. Average enterprise interest earning assets decreased 8% to $41.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in our average loans portfolio, average available for sale mortgage backed securities and average cash and equivalents, partially offset by an increase in average margin receivables, average available for sale and held to maturity securities. Average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased 8% to $38.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to decreases in average complete savings deposits and average certificates of deposit offset by an increase in average sweep deposits. Enterprise net interest spread increased by 19 basis points to 2.91% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was largely driven by a decrease in the yields paid on our deposits and lower wholesale borrowing costs, partially offset by a decrease in higher yielding enterprise interest earning assets. Commissions Commissions decreased 21% to $431.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Our DART volume decreased 16% to 150,532 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. Option related DARTs as a percentage of our total DARTs represented 17% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13% in 2009. Exchange traded funds related DARTs as a percentage of total DARTs represented 10% of trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 14% in 2009. 42 Table of Contents Average commission per trade decreased 1% to $11.21 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The slight decrease in the average commission per trade was due primarily to the elimination of the $12.99 commission tier and the per share commission applied to market trades larger than 2,000 shares, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by an improvement in the product and customer mix when compared to 2009. Fees and Service Charges Fees and service charges decreased 26% to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination of all account activity fees, which became effective in the second quarter of 2010, and lower order flow revenue. Principal Transactions Principal transactions increased 17% to $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in principal transactions was driven by an increase in the volume of orders from our third party customers which was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue earned per share traded when compared to 2009. Gains on Loans and Securities, Net Gains on loans and securities, net were $166.2 million and $169.1 million for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Gains (losses) on loans, net $ 6.3 $ (12.5 ) $ 18.8 * Gains on available for sale securities, net 160.7 173.2 (12.5 ) (7 )% Gains on trading securities, net 0.2 7.8 (7.6 ) (98 )% Hedge ineffectiveness (1.0 ) 0.6 (1.6 ) * Gains on securities, net 159.9 181.6 (21.7 ) (12 )% Gains on loans and securities, net $ 166.2 $ 169.1 $ (2.9 ) (2 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Net Impairment We recognized $37.7 million and $89.1 million of net impairment during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, on certain securities in our non agency CMO portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. The gross OTTI and the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income (loss), are shown in the table below (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) $ (41.5 ) $ (232.1 ) Less: noncredit portion of OTTI recognized into other comprehensive income (loss) (before tax) 3.8 143.0 Net impairment $ (37.7 ) $ (89.1 ) 43 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 3% to $46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due to a decline in the income from the cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance, partially offset by the gain on the sale of approximately $1 billion in savings accounts to Discover Financial Services in the first quarter of 2010. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses decreased 48% to $779.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared 2009. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was driven by lower levels of delinquent loans in our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios. Operating Expense The components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount % Compensation and benefits $ 325.0 $ 366.2 $ (41.2 ) (11 )% Clearing and servicing 147.5 170.7 (23.2 ) (14 )% Advertising and market development 132.2 114.4 17.8 16 % FDIC insurance premiums 77.7 94.3 (16.6 ) (18 )% Professional services 81.2 78.7 2.5 3 % Occupancy and equipment 70.9 78.4 (7.5 ) (10 )% Communications 73.3 84.4 (11.1 ) (13 )% Depreciation and amortization 87.9 83.3 4.6 6 % Amortization of other intangibles 28.5 29.7 (1.2 ) (4 )% Facility restructuring and other exit activities 14.4 20.7 (6.3 ) * Other operating expenses 104.0 122.5 (18.5 ) (15 )% Total operating expense $ 1,142.6 $ 1,243.3 $ (100.7 ) (8 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits decreased 11% to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted from lower incentive compensation expense and lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base compared to 2009. Clearing and Servicing Clearing and servicing expense decreased 14% to $147.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease resulted primarily from lower trading volumes and lower loan balances compared to 2009. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development expense increased 16% to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This fluctuation was due largely to a planned increase in advertising expense to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended December 31, 2010. FDIC Insurance Premiums FDIC insurance premiums decreased 18% to $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was due primarily to an industry wide special assessment that resulted in an additional 44 Table of Contents $21.6 million of expense in the second quarter of 2009. There were no similar assessments made during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased 15% to $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in bad debt expense, real estate owned and legal reserves compared to 2009. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $159.0 million and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Variance Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Amount Variance Corporate interest income $ 6.2 $ 0.9 $ 5.3 620 % Corporate interest expense (167.1 ) (282.7 ) 115.6 (41 )% Gains (losses) on sales of investments, net 2.7 (1.7 ) 4.4 * Losses on early extinguishment of debt (1,018.9 ) 1,018.9 * Equity in loss of investments and venture funds (0.8 ) (8.6 ) 7.8 (91 )% Total other income (expense) $ (159.0 ) $ (1,311.0 ) $ 1,152.0 (88 )% * Percentage not meaningful. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from our interest bearing corporate debt. Corporate interest expense decreased 41% to $167.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. This was due to the reduction in interest bearing debt in connection with our Debt Exchange in 2009. The losses on early extinguishment of debt of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 were related primarily to the Debt Exchange. The loss on the Debt Exchange resulted from de recognition of the debt that was exchanged and the corresponding recognition of the newly issued non interest bearing convertible debentures at fair value. Corporate interest income increased to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009 due to a benefit of $6.0 million in connection with a legal settlement. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a benefit of $537.7 million in 2009. Our effective tax rate was 806.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to (29.3)% in 2009. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was higher than in 2009 for two reasons: 1) our pre tax loss included items not deductible for tax purposes, predominantly about one third of the interest expense on the 2017 Notes; and 2) our reported pre tax loss is relatively close to breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result, our income subject to taxation was higher, resulting in an unusually high effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. Valuation Allowance During the year ended December 31, 2010, we did not maintain a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets as we believed that it was more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognized that we were in a cumulative book loss position as of the three year period ended December 31, 2010, which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believed we were able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position. 45 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW We report operating results in two segments: 1) trading and investing; and 2) balance sheet management.
