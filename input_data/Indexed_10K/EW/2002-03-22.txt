Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis present the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2001. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2001. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview Edwards Lifesciences is a global provider of products and technologies that are designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences focuses on providing products and technologies to address four main cardiovascular disease states: heart valve disease; coronary artery disease; peripheral vascular disease; and congestive heart failure. 19 The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat cardiovascular disease are categorized into four main areas: Cardiac Surgery; Critical Care; Vascular; and Perfusion Edwards Lifesciences cardiac surgery portfolio is comprised of products relating to heart valve therapy and cannulae products used during open heart surgery. Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leader in, and has been a pioneer in the development and commercialization of, tissue valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the critical care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients heart function, and also provides central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery. Edwards Lifesciences vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, angioscopy equipment, artificial implantable grafts, and an endovascular system used to treat life threatening abdominal aortic aneurysms less invasively. In the perfusion category, Edwards Lifesciences develops, manufactures and markets, in regions outside the United States and Western Europe, a diverse line of disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, including oxygenators, blood containers, filters and related devices. Effective June 30, 2001, the Company sold its perfusion services business in the United States to an affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care AG (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). The Company continues to maintain its perfusion services business in Europe. The health care marketplace continues to be competitive. There has been consolidation in Edwards Lifesciences customer base and among its competitors, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. Edwards Lifesciences has experienced increases in its labor and material costs, which are primarily influenced by general inflationary trends. Management expects these trends to continue. Joint Venture in Japan Subsequent to the distribution of the Companys common stock to stockholders of Baxter on March 31, 2000 (referred to as the "Distribution"), the cardiovascular business in Japan is being operated pursuant to a joint venture under which a Japanese subsidiary of Baxter retains ownership of the Japanese business assets, but a subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences holds a 90% profit interest. Edwards Lifesciences has an option to purchase the Japanese business assets that may be exercised no earlier than August 1, 2002 and no later than March 31, 2005. The Japanese operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2000, consistent with the historical treatment of the Companys operations while a part of Baxter. Subsequent to March 31, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences (a) recognizes its shipments into the joint venture as sales at distributor price at the time the joint venture sells to the end customer, and (b) utilizes the equity method of accounting to record its interest in the operations of the joint venture. 20 Results of Operations Net Sales Trends The following table is a summary of domestic and international net sales (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 United States $ 421 $ 482 $ 504 (13% ) (4% ) International 271 322 401 (16% ) (20% ) Total net sales $ 692 $ 804 $ 905 (14% ) (11% ) The net sales decrease in the United States during 2001 was due primarily to the sale of the Companys perfusion services business in the United States effective June 30, 2001 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), partially offset by an increase in sales of cardiac surgery products. The net sales decrease in the United States during 2000 was due primarily to the Companys partial sale of its perfusion product line effective August 31, 2000 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), and a one time $5 million sale of a patent during 1999, partially offset by an increase during 2000 in cardiac surgery sales. The decreases in international net sales during 2001 and 2000 resulted primarily from a change in accounting for sales in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan"). Assuming the change in accounting in Japan was effective as of January 1, 1999, international net sales for the years 2001 and 2000 would have decreased 8% and 4%, respectively. Additionally, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily the movement of the United States dollar against the Euro and the Japanese Yen), international net sales for the years 2001 and 2000 would have decreased 1% and increased 2%, respectively. These adjusted fluctuations were due primarily to the Companys partial sale of its perfusion product line effective August 31, 2000, offset by an increase in sales of cardiac surgery products. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and Edwards Lifesciences hedging activities. For more information, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk." Net Sales by Product Line The following table is a summary of net sales by product line (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Cardiac Surgery $ 329 $ 311 $ 306 6% 2% Critical Care 210 217 242 (3% ) (10% ) Vascular 49 55 61 (11% ) (10% ) Perfusion 102 207 244 (51% ) (15% ) Other 2 14 52 (86% ) (73% ) Total net sales $ 692 $ 804 $ 905 (14% ) (11% ) 21 Assuming the change in accounting for sales in Japan was effective as of January 1, 1999, net sales by product line would have been as follows (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Cardiac Surgery $ 329 $ 309 $ 299 6% 3% Critical Care 210 207 209 1% (1% ) Vascular 49 54 58 (9% ) (7% ) Perfusion 102 202 228 (50% ) (11% ) Other 2 3 15 (33% ) (80% ) Total net sales $ 692 $ 775 $ 809 (11% ) (4% ) Assuming the change in accounting for sales in Japan was effective as of January 1, 1999, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and assuming the sales of the mechanical cardiac assist product line, the perfusion product line and the perfusion services business had occurred as of January 1, 1999 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), net sales by product line would have changed as follows ("Adjusted Net Sales") (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Cardiac Surgery $ 329 $ 300 $ 279 10% 8% Critical Care 213 203 201 5% 1% Vascular 50 53 55 (6% ) (4% ) Perfusion 46 53 54 (14% ) (2% ) Other 1 3 14 (67% ) (79% ) Total net sales $ 639 $ 612 $ 603 4% 1% Cardiac Surgery The Adjusted Net Sales growth in 2001 and 2000 in cardiac surgery products resulted primarily from strong sales growth of pericardial tissue valves and repair products. This increase was partially offset by declines in porcine tissue valve sales as a result of competition and as customers upgraded to pericardial tissue valves. Management expects that its cardiac surgery products will continue to serve as a key driver of Edwards Lifesciences sales growth. Critical Care The Adjusted Net Sales growth in 2001 and 2000 in critical care products was due primarily to strong sales of advanced technology catheter products and the newer access and hemofiltration product categories, partially offset by the decline in base hemodynamic catheters. Critical care products have been, and are expected to continue to be, significant contributors to Edwards Lifesciences total sales. Vascular The decline in Adjusted Net Sales for vascular products resulted primarily from the continued shift to less invasive therapies and non surgical options, and the wind down of a distribution contract in France during 2001. Management continues to see opportunities in peripheral vascular disease treatment and intends to build on the Companys strong base franchise by developing and marketing minimally invasive therapies such as its Lifepath AAA endovascular graft system. In September 2001, the Company received approval to re enter the market in Europe with its Lifepath AAA endovascular 22 graft system and in October 2001 received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to restart clinical studies for the same product in the United States. Perfusion The Adjusted Net Sales decreases for perfusion were due primarily to a reduction in 2001 of products sales to Jostra AG (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net") and a continually increasing number of "beating heart" coronary artery bypass surgeries in Western Europe, which reduced the need for perfusion services. Other Other sales include miscellaneous pharmaceutical and distributed products. The decline in Adjusted Net Sales in 2000 was due primarily to the termination of certain distributed products at the end of 1999 and the $5 million sale of a patent during 1999. Gross Margin Years Ended December 31, Percentage Point Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Gross Margin 53.2% 47.4% 48.5% 5.8 pts. (1.1) pts. Assuming the change in accounting in Japan was effective as of January 1, 1999, and assuming the sales of the mechanical cardiac assist product line, the perfusion product line and the perfusion services business had each occurred on January 1, 1999 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), the gross profit percentage ("Adjusted Percentage") would have been 57% in 2001, 54% in 2000 and 54% in 1999. The Adjusted Percentage increase in the gross profit percentage for 2001 was due primarily to increased sales of higher margin cardiac surgery products. The Adjusted Percentage for 2000 was also favorably impacted by increased sales of higher margin cardiac surgery products, offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Years Ended December 31, Percentage Point Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 29.3% 26.9% 25.7% 2.4 pts. 1.2 pts. Assuming the change in accounting in Japan was effective as of January 1, 1999, and assuming the sales of the mechanical cardiac assist product line, the perfusion product line and the perfusion services business had each occurred on January 1, 1999 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales ("Adjusted Percentage") would have been 31% in 2001, 29% in 2000 and 24% in 1999. The Adjusted Percentage increases in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2001 and 2000 were due primarily to additional personnel costs and expenses associated with the Companys operation as an independent company commencing April 1, 2000. Additionally, in 2000, the Company established a $9.5 million reserve for litigation, property taxes and uncollectable receivables. 23  Research and Development Expenses Years Ended December 31, Percent Point Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 7.9% 6.8% 6.1% 1.1 pts. 0.7 pts Assuming the change in accounting in Japan was effective as of January 1, 1999, and assuming the sales of the mechanical cardiac assist product line, the perfusion product line and the perfusion services business had each occurred on January 1, 1999 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales ("Adjusted Percentage") would have been 8.7% in 2001, 7.6% in 2000 and 6.6% in 1999. The Adjusted Percentage increases in research and development expenses for 2001 and 2000 reflect Edwards Lifesciences commitment to ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of its current leading products and to expand the applications of its products as appropriate. In furtherance of this commitment, the Company expects to increase in 2002 its research and development expenses by 20% from 2001. Goodwill Amortization Goodwill amortization was $19 million, $29 million and $34 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The reduction in goodwill amortization for the years 2001 and 2000 resulted primarily from (a) the sale of the perfusion services business in the United States and the disposition of the related goodwill effective June 30, 2001, and (b) the write down of goodwill effective June 30, 2000 related to the sale of the Companys line of perfusion products in the United States and Western Europe (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). Upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (see "New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Issued"), effective January 1, 2002, the accounting for goodwill will change from an amortization method to an impairment only approach, resulting in the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in 2002. Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net 2001 Initiatives Loss on Sale of Assets ($68 million) Effective June 30, 2001, the Company sold the stock of Edwards Lifesciences Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. ("ELCR") to an affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care AG ("Fresenius") for cash proceeds of $45 million (the "ELCR Sale"), resulting in a pre tax loss of $68 million. ELCR provided and managed perfusionists, monitoring systems, capital equipment and disposable material on a contract service basis to hospitals in the United States and Puerto Rico. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations gives effect to the ELCR Sale as if it had occurred on January 1, 2001 and excludes the $68 million loss on the sale. The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations does not purport to be indicative of either the results of future operations or the results of operations that would have 24 occurred had the ELCR Sale been consummated on January 1, 2001. The following are in millions, except per share amounts: Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales $ 631 Net income 46 Net income per share: Basic 0.78 Diluted 0.75 Other Non Recurring Charges ($15 million) Based upon the non strategic nature and declining profitability of certain products in the Companys portfolio (including certain distributed products), the Company decided during 2001 to discontinue its sales effort of these products. The long lived assets and the investments related to these products were evaluated to determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date. As a result, Edwards Lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of the products or investments over the estimated lives of the related assets were sufficient to recover their costs. Where such cash flows were insufficient, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of assets or investments and recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values. As a result of this evaluation, Edwards Lifesciences recorded a non cash charge of $15 million primarily related to the impairment of intangibles ($9 million), the impairment of an investment, ($5 million) and the write down of non productive assets ($1 million). 2000 Initiatives Loss on Sale and Abandonment of Assets ($302 million) During 2000, the Company sold the majority of its United States and Western European assets and rights related to its perfusion products to Jostra AG (the "Jostra Sale"). In accordance with SFAS No.121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges," the Company recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $290 million in 2000 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value based upon the estimated net proceeds from the Jostra Sale. Assets subject to this impairment charge consisted primarily of goodwill ($245 million) and special use manufacturing and support assets. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated based upon a pro rata allocation of the goodwill using the relative fair values of the affected long lived assets and identifiable intangibles acquired at the inception date of the goodwill. On August 31, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences completed the Jostra Sale for $24 million (consisting of $10 million in cash and a $14 million note receivable, payable in six equal quarterly installments through March 1, 2002, plus interest at an annual effective rate of 8%). All payments under the note have been made. In conjunction with the Jostra Sale, during 2000 the Company recorded charges to establish a $10 million reserve for personnel costs and a $2 million reserve for exit activities. The personnel costs consisted primarily of severance, medical plan continuation and outplacement services for the approximately 225 employees impacted by the Jostra Sale. The impacted employees were located in Europe, the United States and Puerto Rico, and primarily worked in a manufacturing capacity. The exit activities consisted primarily of information systems costs, contract termination costs and shutdown expenses. 25 The following table summarizes the utilization of these reserves through December 31, 2001 (in millions): Initial Reserve Utilized in 2000 Balance at December 31, 2000 Utilized in 2001 Balance at December 31, 2001 Personnel costs $ 10 $ (2 ) $ 8 $ (8 ) $ Exit activities 2 (2 ) $ 12 $ (4 ) $ 8 $ (8 ) $ Gain on Sale of Assets ($35 million) On June 30, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences transferred the rights, intellectual property and United States assets related to the Novacor mechanical cardiac assist product line to World Heart Corporation ("WorldHeart"). In return, the Company received (a) preferred stock of a subsidiary of WorldHeart which, at Edwards Lifesciences option, can be exchanged for approximately 5 million shares of WorldHearts common stock commencing July 2002, bearing a cumulative dividend and maturing in June 2015, and (b) exclusive worldwide distribution rights to the Novacor left ventricular assist system and any ventricular assist technologies developed by WorldHeart. Edwards Lifesciences also will provide components and technical support to WorldHeart for ventricular assist products at agreed upon prices. The Company recorded a pre tax gain of $35 million during 2000 in connection with this transaction. As part of the transaction with WorldHeart, the Company invested $20 million in WorldHeart convertible preferred stock. The preferred stock bears a cumulative dividend, matures in June 2007, is callable at any time by WorldHeart and is convertible by Edwards Lifesciences into WorldHeart common stock commencing July 2006. Edwards Lifesciences reports its investments in WorldHeart as available for sale securities. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations gives effect to the sales to Jostra AG and WorldHeart by Edwards Lifesciences as if the sales had occurred on January 1, 2000 and exclude the $302 million loss on sale to Jostra AG and the $35 million gain on sale to WorldHeart. The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations does not purport to be indicative of either the results of future operations or the results of operations that would have occurred had the sales been consummated on January 1, 2000. The following amounts are in millions, except per share amounts: Year Ended December 31, 2000 Net sales $ 772 Net income 8 Net income per share: Basic 0.14 Diluted 0.13 Other Non Recurring Charges ($45 million) As a result of Edwards Lifesciences continuing efforts to focus the Companys product portfolio and effect the Companys business strategy following the spin off from Baxter, during 2000 the Company decided to discontinue certain products in its portfolio that did not meet the objectives of its business strategy. The long lived assets or the investments in these products were evaluated to determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date. As a result, Edwards Lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of the products over the estimated 26 lives of the related assets were sufficient to recover their costs. Where such cash flows were insufficient, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of assets or investments and recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values. As a result of this evaluation, Edwards Lifesciences recorded a non cash charge of $45 million during 2000 primarily related to the impairment of goodwill unrelated to perfusion products ($37 million), the impairment of other intangibles ($5 million) and the write down of non productive assets ($3 million). Non Recurring Spin Off Expenses In connection with the spin off of Edwards Lifesciences from Baxter, Edwards Lifesciences incurred certain one time costs totaling $18 million during 2000. These costs primarily related to the coordination and implementation of the transaction and the recruitment of personnel to perform new corporate administrative functions. Other Operating Income Other operating income was $16 million and $14 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other operating income represents the Companys profit interest in the cardiovascular business in Japan beginning on April 1, 2000. For more information, see "Joint Venture in Japan." Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net was $23 million and $20 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net for 2001 resulted primarily from a $6 million payment to unwind an interest rate swap agreement that had locked in a fixed interest rate on $75 million of floating rate debt. The decision to unwind this interest rate swap agreement resulted from the Companys pay down of underlying floating rate debt not anticipated to be necessary in funding future requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the impact of the Companys reduction of debt combined with lower interest rates on its floating rate debt. No interest expense was incurred during 1999 as the Companys indebtedness commenced on March 29, 2000 (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources"). Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $10 million, $4 million and $4 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 resulted primarily from a $6 million charge related to the impairment of land investments. See Note 11 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for a summary of the amounts included in other expense, net. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2001 and 2000 were impacted by the non deductibility of the majority of the charges recorded for the disposition of assets and other non recurring items (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). Excluding these non recurring charges, the effective income tax rate was 28% and 27% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 1999 was 27%. 27 Net Income (Loss) Net income (loss), reflecting pro forma adjustments and excluding non recurring charges, both as identified below, would have been as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (in millions) As reported $ (11 ) $ (272 ) $ 82 Pro forma adjustments, net of tax (a) (9 ) (41 ) Non recurring charges, net of tax (b) 74 332 As adjusted $ 63 $ 51 $ 41 (a)Reflects the estimated incremental costs associated with being an independent public company and estimated interest expense associated with the Companys debt that would have been incurred assuming the Companys spin off from Baxter had been completed as of January 1, 1999. (b)See "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net," "Non Recurring Spin Off Expenses," "SG&A Expenses," "Interest Expense, net" and "New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Adopted." Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, amounts available under credit facilities and other external sources of funds. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all. The Company has two unsecured revolving credit agreements (the "Credit Facilities") providing for up to an aggregate of $605 million in borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate (LIBOR) plus 0.78%, which includes a facility fee. One of the credit agreements provides for long term borrowings up to an aggregate of $430 million and expires on March 30, 2005. The other credit agreement provides for short term borrowings up to an aggregate of $175 million and expires on March 29, 2002. The Company anticipates that it will replace, and make effective as of March 28, 2002, the $175 million credit agreement with a credit agreement for $100 million through March 2003. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $310 million was outstanding under the $430 million credit agreement and no borrowings were outstanding under the $175 million credit agreement. Edwards Lifesciences pays a facility fee, regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.15% for the $430 million credit agreement and 0.125% for the $175 million credit agreement. The Credit Facilities contain various financial and other covenants of Edwards Lifesciences, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. All amounts outstanding under the $430 million credit agreement have been classified as long term obligations, as these borrowings will continue to be refinanced pursuant to this credit agreement. The Company has a securitization agreement with a financial institution and a qualified special purpose entity whereby it sells without recourse, on a revolving basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible trade accounts receivable. The significant benefits of the securitization are lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2001 the Company had sold $42 million of 28 trade accounts receivable and received funding of $37 million. These proceeds are generally used to reduce revolving lines of credit. The Company has been able to lower its overall effective cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads imbedded on the proceeds from the sale of its accounts receivable as opposed to borrowings under the current LIBOR based credit facility. Additionally, the Company believes that in diversifying its funding sources, the Companys funding availability in the capital markets is strengthened. The securitization agreement expires each December and is renewable for one year periods at the Companys option. The Company renewed the agreement for a one year term beginning December 21, 2001. Management believes that the expiration or termination of the securitization agreement will not have an adverse material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In November 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to 2 million shares of the Companys outstanding common stock over a three year period. Stock repurchased under the program will primarily be used to offset dilution resulting from shares issued under the Companys employee stock option programs. During 2001, the Company repurchased 26,800 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $686,000. The timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions, stock prices and other cash requirements. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001 were as follows: Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt $ 310 $ $ $ 310 $ Operating leases 15 4 7 4 Unconditional purchase obligations 9 3 3 2 1 Contractual development obligations (a) 59 9 8 4 38 Total contractual cash obligations $ 393 $ 16 $ 18 $ 320 $ 39 (a)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that Edwards Lifesciences is obligated to pay to unconsolidated affiliates upon their achievement of product development milestones. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year 2001 decreased $37 million from the year 2000 due primarily to a $6 million payment to unwind an interest rate swap (see "Interest Expense, net"), $4 million of incremental personnel and exit costs associated with the Companys sale of its perfusion product line to Jostra AG (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), increased corporate costs associated with the Companys operation as an independent company commencing April 1, 2000 and increased inventory levels. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year 2000 decreased $38 million from the year 1999 due primarily to reduced accounts receivable collections (included in cash flows for 1999 was approximately $25 million related to insurance proceeds associated with hurricane damage at one of the Companys manufacturing facilities) and lower earnings (resulting primarily from interest expense and corporate costs associated with the Companys operation as an independent company commencing April 1, 2000). Uses of cash for investing activities during the year 2001 included $11 million of investments in various unconsolidated affiliates, an investment in peripheral stent patent technology and other patent related investments. Cash flows provided by investing activities included $45 million received from the 29 sale of the Companys stock of ELCR and $10 million of installment payments received against a note receivable from Jostra AG (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). Uses of cash for investing activities during the year 2000 included the purchase of two convertible debentures in Sangamo Biosciences, Inc. (totaling $13 million), which were subsequently converted into common stock during the second quarter 2000, an $8 million investment in A Med Systems, Inc. and a $20 million investment in World Heart Corporation. During 2000, the Company received $12 million related to the sale of certain of the Companys perfusion product assets (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). Capital expenditures decreased $8 million to $38 million in 2001, from $46 million in 2000. Capital expenditures during 2001 related primarily to support for manufacturing facilities, information systems and equipment placed at customers. The reduction in 2001 resulted primarily from the completion during 2000 of the expansion and renovation of the Companys corporate headquarters and the sale of the perfusion product line and the perfusion services business. In 2002, the Company expects capital expenditures to be less than $40 million. Euro Conversion On January 1, 1999, the European Economic and Monetary Union created and introduced the Euro, the official single currency for the 11 participating member countries. A transition period was in effect from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2001, during which time transactions were executed in both the Euro and the member countries individual currencies. Effective January 1, 2002, Euro bank notes were introduced and as of July 1, 2002, the Euro will be the sole legal tender of the European Economic and Monetary Union countries. Edwards Lifesciences appointed a team of individuals to address all issues associated with the conversion to the Euro. At the time Edwards Lifesciences switched to using the Euro as the sole functional currency for the affected countries, certain modifications that were primarily related to information systems were required. The costs associated with preparing for the conversion and continued use of the Euro were expensed as incurred and were not material to Edwards Lifesciences financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The potential effects on Edwards Lifesciences operations include the competitive impact of cross border price transparency, which may make it more difficult for a business to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis now that the Euro has begun circulation. New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Adopted Effective January 1, 2001, Edwards Lifesciences adopted the provisions of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities, measured at fair value. Accounting for the gain or loss due to changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative qualifies as a hedge. If the derivative instrument does not qualify as a hedge, the gains or losses are reported in earnings when they occur. If the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge, the accounting varies based upon the type of risk being hedged. Adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a one time cumulative after tax increase in net loss of $1 million and a $5 million decrease in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Effective January 1, 2001, Edwards Lifesciences adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." This statement replaces SFAS No. 125 and revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral. SFAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. This statement is effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization 30 transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Issued In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142, which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. No transition adjustment was recorded upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2002. However, adoption of this standard resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization commencing January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143, which changes the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs, will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144, which changes the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk, opportunity and costs. Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rate and currency exchange exposures. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, option based products and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $324 million and $415 million, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, option based products and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the Companys exposure through its use of derivatives. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis. The Companys interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate, at specified intervals, calculated on an agreed upon notional amount. As part of its overall risk management program the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 47 basis point increase in interest rates (approximately 10 percent of the Companys weighted average interest rate) affecting the Companys financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments, would increase the Companys annual interest expense by approximately $0.7 million. 31 Currency Risk The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese Yen and the Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option based products consist primarily of purchased put options in conjunction with written (sold) call options to create collars. Option based products are agreements that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels. As part of its risk management process, the Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, with a 95 percent confidence level, using spot and three month implied volatilities as stochastic variables and correlations (as of the measurement date) to estimate this potential loss. The Companys calculated VAR at December 31, 2001, with a maturity of up to one year, is $2 million. This amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Companys calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future. Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counter party diversification, monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2001 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2001, all derivative financial instruments, based on notional amounts, were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "AA" or better by national rating 32 agencies. The Company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of December 31, 2001; the Company has not experienced any counter party default during the three years ended December 31, 2001. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the health care industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of managements allowance for doubtful accounts during all periods presented. Sales to Baxter, acting in the capacity of the Companys distributor subsequent to the Distribution, represented 11% and 12% of the Companys total net sales for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other Risks The Company has invested in several unconsolidated affiliates valued as of December 31, 2001 at $93 million, of which approximately $74 million is attributable to the Companys investment in World Heart Corporation (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). The valuation of these investments is dependent upon the affiliates abilities to achieve development milestones and cash flow projections. While a reduction in the fair values of the unconsolidated affiliates could have a material adverse impact to Edwards Lifesciences operating results, management believes a reduction in the fair values of the affiliates would not be material to Edwards Lifesciences financial position or cash flows.
