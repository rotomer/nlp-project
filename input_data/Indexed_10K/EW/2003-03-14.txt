Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis present the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2002. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2002. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain disclosures prepared in accordance Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") contained in this discussion are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. These non GAAP disclosures generally: exclude the impacts of foreign exchange; present Japan on a consolidated basis for all periods (see "Joint Venture in Japan"); and exclude the impacts of various divestitures and other non recurring charges (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). Management has determined that inclusion of these non GAAP disclosures provides a more meaningful comparison of the Companys operating results for the periods presented in this discussion and better reflects the Companys ongoing operations. Overview Edwards Lifesciences is a global provider of products and technologies that are designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences focuses on providing products and technologies to address four main cardiovascular disease states: heart valve disease; coronary artery disease; peripheral vascular disease; and congestive heart failure. The products and services provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat cardiovascular disease are categorized into five main areas: Cardiac Surgery; Critical Care; Vascular; Perfusion; and Other Distributed Products. Edwards Lifesciences cardiac surgery portfolio is comprised primarily of products relating to heart valve therapy, transmyocardial revascularization, and cannula products used during open heart surgery. Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leader in, and has been a pioneer in the development and commercialization of, tissue valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the critical care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients heart function, and also provides central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery. Edwards Lifesciences vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, angioscopy equipment, artificial implantable grafts, and an endovascular system used to treat life threatening abdominal aortic aneurysms less invasively. In the perfusion category, Edwards Lifesciences develops, manufactures and markets, in regions outside 20 the United States and Western Europe, a diverse line of disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, including oxygenators, blood containers, filters and related devices. Effective June 30, 2001, the Company sold its perfusion services business in the United States to an affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care AG (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). The Company continues to maintain a small perfusion services business in Europe. Lastly, other distributed products include sales of intra aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold though the Companys distribution network in Japan, and miscellaneous pharmaceutical products sold in the United States. The health care marketplace continues to be competitive. There has been consolidation in Edwards Lifesciences customer base and among its competitors, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. Edwards Lifesciences has experienced increases in its labor and material costs, which are primarily influenced by general inflationary trends. Management expects these trends to continue. Joint Venture in Japan The Japanese business is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2000, consistent with the historical treatment of the Companys operations while a part of Baxter. Subsequent to the distribution of the Companys common stock to stockholders of Baxter on March 31, 2000 (referred to as the "Distribution"), the cardiovascular business in Japan was being operated pursuant to a joint venture under which a Japanese subsidiary of Baxter retained ownership of the Japanese business assets, but a subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences held a 90% profit interest. Edwards Lifesciences was given an option to purchase the Japanese business assets that was exercisable no earlier than August 1, 2002 and no later than March 31, 2005. From April 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002, Edwards Lifesciences (a) recognized its shipments into the joint venture as sales at distributor price at the time the joint venture sold to the end customer, and (b) utilized the equity method of accounting to record its 90% profit interest in the operations of the joint venture in Other Operating Income. On October 1, 2002, the Company acquired from Baxter for $19.0 million, net, the cardiovascular business in Japan. The purchase price excluded approximately $30 million of securitized accounts receivable. In the three months ended September 30, 2002, the Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory expenses related to the acquisition. Commencing October 1, 2002 the Company began reporting the results of the Japan business on a fully consolidated basis. The acquisition did not materially impact the Companys net income as the terms of the joint venture agreement enabled Edwards Lifesciences to record substantially all of the net profit generated by the Japan business. Results of Operations Net Sales Trends The following table is a summary of domestic and international net sales (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 United States $ 383.3 $ 420.8 $ 481.8 (8.9 %) (12.7 %) International 320.7 271.3 322.0 18.2 % (15.7 %) Total net sales $ 704.0 $ 692.1 $ 803.8 1.7 % (13.9 %) The net sales decreases in the United States during 2002 and 2001 were due primarily to the sale of the Companys perfusion services business in the United States effective June 30, 2001, partially 21 offset by an increase in sales of cardiac surgery products. The 2001 decrease was also impacted by the sale of the Companys perfusion products line effective August 31, 2000 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net" for more information regarding the sales of the perfusion services and products lines). The increase in international net sales in 2002 and the decrease in 2001 resulted primarily from the change in accounting for sales in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan"). Assuming the Japan business was consolidated for all periods presented, international net sales for the years 2002 and 2001 would have increased 4.5% and decreased 7.2%, respectively. Additionally, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily the movement of the United States dollar against the Euro and the Japanese Yen), international net sales for the years 2002 and 2001 would have increased 5.5% and 1.3%, respectively. These adjusted fluctuations were due primarily to an increase in sales of cardiac surgery products, offset in 2001 by the partial sale of the Company perfusion products line effective August 31, 2000. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and Edwards Lifesciences hedging activities. For more information, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk." Net Sales by Product Line The following table is a summary of net sales by product line (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Cardiac Surgery $ 365.9 $ 329.0 $ 311.2 11.2 % 5.7 % Critical Care 230.3 209.9 217.3 9.7 % (3.4 %) Vascular 51.3 49.3 54.8 4.1 % (10.0 %) Perfusion 43.2 102.1 206.7 (57.7 %) (50.6 %) Other Distributed Products 13.3 1.8 13.8 638.9 % (87.0 %) Total net sales $ 704.0 $ 692.1 $ 803.8 1.7 % (13.9 %) Commencing October 1, 2002 the Company began reporting the results of its Japan business on a fully consolidated basis. Assuming the Japan business was consolidated for all periods presented, net sales by product line would have been as follows (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Cardiac Surgery $ 375.0 $ 338.6 $ 317.9 10.8 % 6.5 % Critical Care 251.1 245.2 247.7 2.4 % (1.0 %) Vascular 53.3 52.3 57.3 1.9 % (8.7 %) Perfusion 58.6 122.6 221.3 (52.2 %) (44.6 %) Other Distributed Products 43.2 42.5 47.2 1.6 % (10.0 %) Total net sales $ 781.2 $ 801.2 891.4 (2.5 %) (10.1 %) Assuming the Japan business was consolidated for all periods presented, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and assuming the sales of (a) the mechanical cardiac assist product line, (b) the perfusion product line and (c) the perfusion services business had occurred as of 22 January 1, 2000 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non recurring Charges, net"), net sales by product line ("Adjusted Net Sales") would have changed as follows (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Cardiac Surgery $ 376.4 $ 338.6 308.7 11.2 % 9.7 % Critical Care 258.6 250.6 240.5 3.2 % 4.2 % Vascular 53.6 52.5 55.6 2.1 % (5.6 %) Perfusion 63.4 66.2 70.1 (4.2 %) (5.6 %) Other Distributed Products 49.0 46.4 46.2 5.6 % 0.4 % Total net sales $ 801.0 $ 754.3 $ 721.1 6.2 % 4.6 % Cardiac Surgery The Adjusted Net Sales growth in 2002 and 2001 in cardiac surgery products resulted primarily from strong sales growth of pericardial tissue valves and heart valve repair products in the United States and Japan. Management expects that its heart valve therapy products will continue to serve as a key driver of Edwards Lifesciences sales growth. Critical Care The Adjusted Net Sales growth in 2002 and 2001 in critical care products was due primarily to strong sales of advanced technology catheter products and access and hemofiltration products, partially offset by the decline in base hemodynamic catheters. Critical care products have been, and are expected to continue to be, significant contributors to Edwards Lifesciences total sales. Vascular The Adjusted Net Sales growth for vascular products for 2002 was primarily the result of initial sales of the Lifepath AAA endovascular graft system, which offset declining sales of the Companys base vascular products due to the ongoing shift to less invasive therapies and non surgical options. The decline in Adjusted Net Sales for vascular products for 2001 resulted primarily from declines in base vascular products, and the wind down of a distribution contract in France during 2001. Management continues to see opportunities in less invasive peripheral vascular disease treatments and intends to build on the Companys strong base franchise by developing and marketing products such as (a) its Lifepath AAA endovascular graft system, which is currently being marketed in Europe and undergoing clinical studies in the United States, and (b) a broad peripheral stent offering, which is scheduled for launch in mid 2003. Perfusion The Adjusted Net Sales decrease for perfusion for 2002 and 2001 was due primarily to an ongoing reduction of sales to Jostra AG, the purchaser during 2000 of the Companys line of perfusion products in Western Europe and the United States. Additionally, in 2001 there was a decline in perfusion services in Western Europe due to a continually increasing number of "beating heart" coronary artery bypass surgeries. The Company anticipates that sales of distributed perfusion products in certain regions and its sales to Jostra will continue to decline. Other Distributed Products Other distributed products includes sales of intra aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold though the Companys distribution network in Japan, and 23 miscellaneous pharmaceutical products sold in the United States. The increase in Adjusted Net Sales in 2002 is spread across several product categories. Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, Percentage Point Increase 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 57.5 % 53.2 % 47.3 % 4.3 pts. 5.9 pts. Reflecting the Japanese business on a consolidated basis for all periods presented, and assuming the sales of the mechanical cardiac assist product line, the perfusion products line and the perfusion services business (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non recurring Charges, net") had occurred on January 1, 2000, gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("Adjusted Percentage") would have been 57.7% in 2002, 57.1% in 2001 and 55.2% in 2000. The increase in the Adjusted Percentage for 2002 and 2001 was due primarily to increased sales of higher margin cardiac surgery products, offset in 2002 by the impact of foreign exchange. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Years Ended December 31, Percentage Point Increase 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 32.4 % 29.4 % 26.8 % 3.0 pts. 2.6 pts. Reflecting the Japanese business on a consolidated basis for all periods presented, and assuming the sales of the mechanical cardiac assist product line, the perfusion products line and the perfusion services business (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non recurring Charges, net") had occurred on January 1, 2000, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales ("Adjusted Percentage") would have been 33.5% in 2002, 32.8% in 2001 and 31.0% in 2000. The increase in the Adjusted Percentage for 2002 was due primarily to increased spending on heart valve growth opportunities and the impact of foreign exchange. The Adjusted Percentage increase in 2001 was due primarily to additional personnel costs and expenses associated with the Companys operation as an independent company commencing April 1, 2000. Research and Development Expenses Years Ended December 31, Percentage Point Increase 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.3 % 7.9 % 6.8 % 1.4 pts. 1.1 pts. Reflecting the Japanese business on a consolidated basis for all periods presented, and assuming the sales of the mechanical cardiac assist product line, the perfusion products line and the perfusion services business (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non recurring Charges, net") had occurred on January 1, 2000, research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales ("Adjusted Percentage") would have been 8.7% in 2002, 7.8% in 2001 and 6.7% in 2000. The Adjusted Percentage increases in research and development expenses relate primarily to investments in the Companys peripheral vascular disease platform and other growth initiatives. These increases reflect Edwards Lifesciences commitment to ongoing research and development to deliver 24 advanced new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of its current products and to expand the applications of its products as appropriate. Goodwill Amortization The elimination of goodwill amortization for the year 2002 resulted from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (see "New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Issued"). Effective January 1, 2002, the accounting for goodwill changed from an amortization method to an impairment only approach. The reduction in goodwill amortization for the year 2001 resulted primarily from (a) the sale of the perfusion services business in the United States and the disposition of the related goodwill effective June 30, 2001, and (b) the write down of goodwill related to the sale of the Companys line of perfusion products in the United States and Western Europe effective June 30, 2000 (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). Disposition of Assets and Other Non recurring Charges, net 2002 In September 2002, the Company recorded a $67.4 million pretax charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of World Heart Corporation ("WorldHeart"). The investment was written down to $6.2 million, which represented the value of the Companys preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at October 15, 2002. The decision to record the charge was based primarily on delays in WorldHearts product development timelines, arising from its revised strategy. 2001 Loss on Sale of Assets ($68.2 million) Effective June 30, 2001, the Company sold the stock of Edwards Lifesciences Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. ("ELCR") to Fresenius Medical Care AG ("Fresenius") for cash proceeds of $45.0 million (the "ELCR Sale"), resulting in a pre tax loss of $68.2 million. ELCR provided and managed perfusionists, monitoring systems, capital equipment and disposable material on a contract service basis to hospitals in the United States and Puerto Rico. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations gives effect to the ELCR Sale as if it had occurred on January 1, 2001 and excludes the $68.2 million loss on the sale. The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations does not purport to be indicative of either the results of future operations or the results of operations that would have occurred had the ELCR Sale been consummated on January 1, 2001. The following amounts are in millions, except per share amounts: Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales $ 631.1 Net income 45.9 Net loss per share: Basic 0.78 Diluted 0.75 25 Other Non recurring Charges ($14.8 million) Based upon the non strategic nature and declining profitability of certain products in the Companys portfolio (including certain distributed products), the Company decided during the quarter ended June 30, 2001 to discontinue its sales effort of these products. The long lived assets and the investments related to these products were evaluated to determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date. As a result, Edwards Lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of the products or investments over the estimated lives of the related assets were sufficient to recover their costs. Where such cash flows were insufficient, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of assets or investments and recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values. As a result of this evaluation, Edwards Lifesciences recorded a non cash charge of $14.8 million primarily related to the impairment of intangibles ($8.3 million), the impairment of an investment ($5.5 million) and the write down of non productive assets ($1.0 million). 2000 Loss on Sale and Abandonment of Assets ($302.0 million) During 2000, the Company sold the majority of its United States and Western European assets and rights related to its perfusion products to Jostra AG (the "Jostra Sale"). In accordance with SFAS No.121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges," the Company recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $290.5 million in 2000 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value based upon the estimated net proceeds from the Jostra Sale. Assets subject to this impairment charge consisted primarily of goodwill ($245.0 million) and special use manufacturing and support assets. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated based upon a pro rata allocation of the goodwill using the relative fair values of the affected long lived assets and identifiable intangibles acquired at the inception date of the goodwill. On August 31, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences completed the Jostra Sale for $24.0 million (consisting of $10.0 million in cash and a $14.0 million note receivable, payable in six equal quarterly installments through March 1, 2002, plus interest at an annual effective rate of 8%). All payments under the note have been made. In conjunction with the Jostra Sale, during 2000 the Company recorded charges to establish a $9.7 million reserve for personnel costs and a $1.8 million reserve for exit activities. The personnel costs consisted primarily of severance, medical plan continuation and outplacement services for the approximately 225 employees impacted by the Jostra Sale. The impacted employees were located in Europe, the United States and Puerto Rico, and primarily worked in a manufacturing capacity. The exit activities consisted primarily of information systems costs, contract termination costs and shutdown expenses. The following table summarizes the utilization of these reserves through December 31, 2001 (in millions): Initial Reserve Utilized in 2000 Balance at December 31, 2000 Utilized in 2001 Balance at December 31, 2001 Personnel costs $ 9.7 $ (1.8 ) $ 7.9 $ (7.9 ) $ Exit activities 1.8 (1.4 ) 0.4 (0.4 ) $ 11.5 $ (3.2 ) $ 8.3 $ (8.3 ) $ 26 Gain on Sale of Assets ($35.0 million) On June 30, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences transferred the rights, intellectual property and United States assets related to the Novacor mechanical cardiac assist product line to WorldHeart. In return, the Company received (a) preferred stock of a subsidiary of WorldHeart which, at Edwards option, can be exchanged for approximately five million shares of WorldHearts common stock commencing July 2003, bears a cumulative dividend and matures in June 2015, and (b) exclusive worldwide distribution rights to the Novacor left ventricular assist system and any ventricular assist technologies developed by WorldHeart. Edwards Lifesciences also will provide components and technical support to WorldHeart for ventricular assist products at agreed upon prices. The Company recorded a pre tax gain of $35.0 million during 2000 in connection with this transaction. As part of the transaction with WorldHeart, the Company invested $20.0 million in WorldHeart convertible preferred stock. The preferred stock bears a cumulative dividend, matures in June 2007, is callable at any time by WorldHeart and is convertible by Edwards Lifesciences into WorldHeart common stock commencing July 2006. Edwards Lifesciences reports its investments in WorldHeart as available for sale securities. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations gives effect to the sales to Jostra AG and WorldHeart by Edwards Lifesciences as if the sales had occurred on January 1, 2000 and exclude the $302.0 million loss on sale to Jostra AG and the $35.0 million gain on sale to WorldHeart. The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations does not purport to be indicative of either the results of future operations or the results of operations that would have occurred had the sales been consummated on January 1, 2000. The following amounts are in millions, except per share amounts: Year Ended December 31, 2000 Net sales $ 771.9 Net income 8.2 Net income per share: Basic 0.14 Diluted 0.13 Other Non recurring Charges ($45.2 million) As a result of Edwards Lifesciences continuing efforts to focus the Companys product portfolio and effect the Companys business strategy following the spin off from Baxter, during 2000 the Company decided to discontinue certain products in its portfolio that did not meet the objectives of its business strategy. The long lived assets or the investments in these products were evaluated to determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date. As a result, Edwards Lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of the products over the estimated lives of the related assets were sufficient to recover their costs. Where such cash flows were insufficient, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of assets or investments and recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values. As a result of this evaluation, Edwards Lifesciences recorded a non cash charge of $45.2 million during 2000 primarily related to the impairment of goodwill unrelated to perfusion products ($37.0 million), impairment of other intangibles ($5.1 million) and the write down of non productive assets ($3.1 million). 27 Non recurring Spin off Expenses During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory expenses related to the acquisition of the cardiovascular business in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan"). In connection with the spin off of Edwards Lifesciences from Baxter, Edwards Lifesciences incurred certain one time costs totaling $18.4 million during 2000. These costs primarily related to the coordination and implementation of the transaction and the recruitment of personnel to perform new corporate administrative functions. Other Operating Income Other operating income was $11.0 million and $16.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other operating income represents the Companys 90% profit interest in the cardiovascular business in Japan effective from April 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. For more information, see "Joint Venture in Japan." Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net was $11.5 million and $22.9 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in interest expense, net for 2002 resulted primarily from (a) the Companys reduction of debt, (b) lower interest rates on its floating rate debt, and (c) a $6.2 million charge during the three months ended June 30, 2001 related to a payment to unwind an interest rate swap agreement that had locked in a fixed interest rate on $75.0 million of floating rate debt. The decision to unwind the interest rate swap agreement resulted from the Companys pay down of underlying floating rate debt not anticipated to be necessary in funding future requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The increase in interest expense, net for 2001 resulted primarily from the $6.2 million charge to unwind the interest rate swap agreement, described above, partially offset by the impact of the Companys reduction of debt and lower interest rates on its floating rate debt. Other (Income) Expense, net The following is a summary of other (income) expense, net (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Legal settlement, net $ (14.7 ) $ $ Foreign exchange (gain) loss (4.1 ) 5.0 2.3 Asset dispositions and write downs, net 2.3 6.5 0.5 Investment write offs 1.4 Other (0.3 ) (0.9 ) 1.0 $ (15.4 ) $ 10.6 $ 3.8 Effective April 24, 2002, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic, Inc. entered into an agreement related to certain patent infringement claims pursuant to which the Company received a one time cash payment of $20.0 million (recorded as a gain of $14.7 million, net of legal expenses). Foreign exchange gains and losses relate to global trade and intercompany receivable balances. 28  Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were impacted by several non recurring items as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Provision for income taxes on recurring operations $ 29.1 $ 24.5 $ 18.4 Tax benefit from sale of perfusion services subsidiary in 2001 (20.1 ) (11.9 ) Tax benefit from impairment charge on WorldHeart investment (13.3 ) Impact of legal settlement 5.6 Other (1.0 ) (11.1 ) (5.1 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes, as reported $ 0.3 $ 1.5 $ 13.3 As a result of recent tax law developments and the filing of the Companys 2001 tax return, the Company recorded a $20.1 million tax benefit during 2002 related to the loss on sale of its United States perfusion services business in June 2001. Excluding the impact of non recurring items, the effective income tax rate was 26.0%, 28.0% and 26.6% for 2002, 2001 and 2000. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for 2002 was due primarily to the elimination of all non deductible goodwill amortization upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. For more information see "New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Adopted." The increase in the effective income tax rate for 2001 was due primarily to sales growth from products manufactured and sold in the United States, one of the Companys highest tax jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, amounts available under credit facilities and other external sources of funds. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all. The Company has two unsecured revolving credit agreements (the "Credit Facilities") providing for up to an aggregate of $530.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate (LIBOR) plus 0.78%, which includes a facility fee. One of the credit agreements provides for long term borrowings up to an aggregate of $430.0 million and expires on March 30, 2005. The other credit agreement provides for short term borrowings up to an aggregate of $100.0 million through March 27, 2003. The Company anticipates that it will replace the $100.0 million credit agreement with a similar credit agreement through March 2004. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $245.5 million was outstanding under the $430.0 million credit agreement. Edwards Lifesciences pays a facility fee, regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.15% for the $430 million credit agreement and, 0.125% for the $100 million credit agreement. The Credit Facilities contain various financial and other covenants of Edwards Lifesciences, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. All amounts outstanding under the $430 million credit agreement have been classified as long term obligations, as these borrowings will continue to be refinanced pursuant to this credit agreement. 29 As further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has also entered into two securitization agreements whereby it sells without recourse, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of trade accounts receivable. The significant benefits of the securitizations are lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity. As of December 31, 2002 the Company had sold a total of $82.7 million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of $67.1 million under both agreements. These proceeds are generally used to reduce revolving lines of credit. The Company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to borrowings under the current LIBOR based credit facility. Additionally, the Company believes that in diversifying its funding sources, the Companys funding availability in the capital markets is strengthened. The securitization agreements expire each December and are renewable for one year periods at the Companys option. Management believes that the expiration or termination of the securitization agreements will not have an adverse material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In November 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to two million shares of the Companys outstanding common stock. Stock repurchased under the program will primarily be used to offset obligations under the Companys employee stock option programs. Through December 31, 2002 the Company had repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $31.5 million. For the period January 1, 2003, through March 12, 2003, the Company repurchased approximately an additional 0.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $8.2 million. On February 18, 2003, the Company announced that it had acquired the endovascular mitral valve repair program of Jomed N.V., a European based provider of products for minimally invasive vascular intervention, for approximately $20.0 million in cash. The acquisition includes all technology and intellectual property associated with the program. The Company expects to take an in process research and development charge related to this transaction in the first quarter of 2003. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002 were as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 13 Years 45 Years After 5 Years Long term debt $ 245.5 $ $ 245.5 $ $ Operating leases 18.5 5.8 8.7 4.0 Unconditional purchase obligations 23.2 5.8 11.6 5.8 Contractual development obligations (a) 58.0 13.7 2.3 4.0 38.0 Total contractual cash obligations $ 345.2 $ 25.3 $ 268.1 $ 13.8 $ 38.0 (a)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that Edwards Lifesciences is obligated to pay to unconsolidated affiliates upon their achievement of product development milestones. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year 2002 increased $19.4 million from the year 2001 due primarily to higher earnings (before non cash items), which included a $20.0 million legal settlement (see "Other (income) expense, net"), and decreased inventory levels. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by higher net cash outflows from accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year 2001 decreased $36.5 million from the year 2000 due primarily to a $6.2 million payment to unwind an interest rate swap (see "Interest Expense, 30 net"), $5.1 million of incremental personnel and exit costs associated with the Companys sale of its perfusion product line to Jostra AG (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"), increased corporate costs associated with the Companys operation as an independent company commencing April 1, 2000 and increased inventory levels. Uses of cash for investing activities during the year 2002 included $19.0 million spent to acquire the Japan business (see "Joint Venture in Japan") and $12.7 million of investments in various unconsolidated affiliates, investments in patent technology related to the Companys peripheral stent program and other patent related investments. Uses of cash for investing activities during the year 2001 included $10.6 million of investments in various unconsolidated affiliates, an investment in peripheral stent patent technology and other patent related investments. Cash flows provided by investing activities included $45.0 million received from the sale of the Companys stock of ELCR and $9.7 million of installment payments received against a note receivable from Jostra AG (see "Disposition of Assets and Other Non Recurring Charges, net"). Capital expenditures increased $3.2 million to $40.7 million in 2002 from $37.5 million in 2001. Capital expenditures during 2002 related primarily to support for manufacturing facilities, information systems and monitoring equipment placed at customers. The increase in 2002 resulted primarily from capital investments in information systems in the Companys Japanese business acquired on October 1, 2002. In 2003, the Company expects capital expenditures to be less than $45 million. Capital expenditures decreased $8.5 million to $37.5 million in 2001, from $46.0 million in 2000. The reduction in 2001 resulted primarily from the completion during 2000 of the expansion and renovation of the Companys corporate headquarters and the sale of the perfusion product line and the perfusion services business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Companys accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Companys transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions. Management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies. Management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, any impairments of assets, anticipated transactions to be hedged, reserves and contingencies. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies, which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. 31 Revenue Recognition Sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, and collection is reasonably assured. Management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured. For certain products, the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations. For these products, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Company reduces revenue with reserves for estimated price concessions and sales returns. Allowances, which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized, in accordance with SFAS No. 48, "Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists," are based upon historical price concessions and sales returns. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.5 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $9.6 million and $9.4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Impairment of Long Lived Assets On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," whereby goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review. As the Companys operations are comprised of one reporting unit, the Company reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the Companys fair value to the net book value of its assets. If the book value of the Companys assets exceeds the Companys fair value, the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For the purpose of identifying and measuring impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. 32 Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost method and have been designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. The fair values of certain investments are based on quoted market prices. For other investments, various methods are used to estimate fair value, including external valuations and discounted cash flows. When the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss: the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Income Taxes The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure. New laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates. To the extent the Companys estimates differ from actual payments or assessments, income tax expense is adjusted. During 2002, the Company resolved certain matters from 2001 resulting in a $20.1 million reduction of its provision for income taxes. Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $19.9 million at December 31, 2002 for the majority of its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards. The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards that are expected to be realized. An increase to income would result if the Company determines it could utilize more net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards than originally expected. At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from the Companys estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Employee Stock Options The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," in accounting for stock based compensation; therefore, no compensation expense has been recognized for its fixed stock option plans as options generally are granted at fair market value based upon the closing price on the date immediately preceding the grant date. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements for SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." Accordingly, if compensation expense for the Companys stock options had been recognized, based upon the fair value of awards granted, the Companys net income and earnings per 33 share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts (in millions, except per share amounts): 2002 2001 2000 As Reported Pro Forma As Reported Pro Forma As Reported Pro Forma Net Income $ 55.7 $ 42.2 $ (11.4 ) $ (20.0 ) $ (271.7 ) $ (279.0 ) Basic earnings per share 0.94 0.72 (0.19 ) (0.34 ) Diluted earnings per share 0.91 0.69 (0.19 ) (0.34 ) The per share weighted average fair value for options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $11.64, $7.00 and $6.39, respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2002 2001 2000 Average risk free interest rate 4.35% 5.8% 5.8% Expected dividend yield None None None Expected volatility 44% 45% 45% Expected live (years) 5 5 5 New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Adopted In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142, which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. No transition adjustment was recorded upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2002. However, adoption of this standard resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization commencing January 1, 2002. See Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for more information. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144, which changes the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51." This interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities. Certain provisions of this interpretation were effective immediately. While the Company has a qualified special purpose entity, this interpretation does not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements as qualified special purpose entities are specifically excluded from the interpretations requirements. New Accounting and Disclosure Standards Issued In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143, which changes the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs, will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 changes the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity, including certain costs incurred in a restructuring. The provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The Company does not 34 expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk, opportunity and costs. Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, option based products and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $588.2 million and $324.8 million, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, option based products, and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, are not a measure of the Companys exposure through its use of derivatives. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis. The Companys interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate, at specified intervals, calculated on an agreed upon notional amount. As part of its overall risk management program the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 46 basis point increase in interest rates (approximately 10 percent of the Companys weighted average interest rate), affecting the Companys financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments, would increase the Companys annual interest expense, net by approximately $0.3 million. Currency Risk The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese Yen and the Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net United States dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option based products consist primarily of purchased put options in conjunction with written (sold) call options to create collars. Option based products are agreements 35 that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels. As part of its risk management process, the Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, with a 95 percent confidence level, using spot and three month implied volatilities as stochastic variables and correlations (as of the measurement date) to estimate this potential loss. The Companys calculated VAR at December 31, 2002, with a maturity of up to one year, is $4.3 million. This amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Companys calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future. Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counter party diversification, monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2002 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2002, all derivative financial instruments, based on notional amounts, were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "AA" or better by national rating agencies. The Company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of December 31, 2002; the Company has not experienced any counterparty default during the three years ended December 31, 2002. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the health care industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses which, when realized, have been within the range of managements allowance for doubtful accounts during all periods presented. Sales to Baxter, acting in the capacity of the Companys distributor subsequent to the Distribution, represented approximately 8%, 11% and 12% of the Companys total net sales for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Substantially all of these agreements had been terminated as of December 31, 2002. Investment Risk Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies. These 36 investments are classified in "Investments in unconsolidated affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2002, the Company recorded a $67.4 million pretax charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of WorldHeart. The investment was written down to $6.2 million, which represented the value of the Companys preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at October 15, 2002. The decision to record the charge was based primarily on delays in WorldHearts product development timelines, arising from its revised strategy. Should WorldHeart fail to meet certain future development and financing milestones, further impairment charges may be necessary. In addition to the investment in WorldHeart ($6.1 million at December 31, 2002), Edwards Lifesciences had approximately $17.4 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies. At December 31, 2002, the Company had recorded unrealized losses on these investments of $6.8 million in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income," net of tax. Management considers these declines temporary in nature based upon the individual companies operating results, financial condition and achievement of product development milestones. Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary.
