Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2003. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2003. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview Edwards Lifesciences is a global provider of products and technologies that are designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences focuses on providing products and technologies 22 to address four main cardiovascular disease states: heart valve disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. The products and services provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat cardiovascular disease are categorized into five main areas: Cardiac Surgery, Critical Care, Vascular, Perfusion and Other Distributed Products. Edwards Lifesciences cardiac surgery portfolio is comprised primarily of products relating to heart valve therapy, cannula products used during open heart surgery and transmyocardial revascularization ("TMR"). Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leader in, and has been a pioneer in, the development and commercialization of tissue valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the critical care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients heart function, and also provides central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery. Edwards Lifesciences vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, angioscopy equipment, stents and artificial implanteable grafts. In the perfusion category, Edwards Lifesciences develops, manufactures and markets, in regions outside the United States and Western Europe, a diverse line of disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, including oxygenators, blood containers, filters and related devices. Lastly, other distributed products include sales of intra aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold through the Companys distribution network in Japan, and miscellaneous pharmaceutical products sold in the United States. In order to provide greater visibility to a key part of its business, beginning in January 2004, the Company will recategorize its products into Heart Valve Therapy, Cardiac Surgery Systems, Critical Care, Vascular and Other Distributed Products. Heart Valve Therapy will include all heart valve repair and replacement products, and Cardiac Surgery Systems will include cannula products used during open heart surgery, TMR products, and all products currently in the perfusion category. The other categories will remain the same. The health care marketplace continues to be competitive. There has been consolidation in Edwards Lifesciences customer base and among its competitors, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. Edwards Lifesciences has experienced increases in its labor and material costs, which are primarily influenced by general inflationary trends. Management expects these trends to continue. Joint Venture in Japan Subsequent to the distribution of the Companys common stock to stockholders of Baxter International Inc. ("Baxter") on March 31, 2000 the cardiovascular business in Japan was being operated pursuant to a joint venture under which a Japanese subsidiary of Baxter retained ownership of the Japanese business assets, but a subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences held a 90% profit interest. From April 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002, Edwards Lifesciences (a) recognized its shipments into the joint venture as sales at distributor price at the time the joint venture sold to the end customer, and (b) utilized the equity method of accounting to record its 90% profit interest in the operations of the joint venture in Other Operating Income. On October 1, 2002, the Company acquired from Baxter for $19.0 million, net, the cardiovascular business in Japan. The purchase price excluded approximately $30.0 million of securitized accounts receivable. In the three months ended September 30, 2002, the Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory expenses related to the acquisition. Commencing October 1, 2002, the Company began reporting the results of the Japan business on a fully consolidated basis. The acquisition did not materially impact the Companys net income as the terms of the joint venture agreement enabled Edwards Lifesciences to record substantially all of the net profit generated by the Japan business. 23 Results of Operations Net Sales Trends The following is a summary of United States and international net sales (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 United States $ 384.3 $ 383.3 $ 420.8 0.3 % (8.9 %) International 476.2 320.7 271.3 48.5 % 18.2 % Total net sales $ 860.5 $ 704.0 $ 692.1 22.2 % 1.7 % The decrease in the United States net sales in 2002 was due primarily to the sale of the Companys U.S. perfusion services business in June 2001, which decreased United States net sales by 14.5 percentage points. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of cardiac surgery products. The increase in international net sales in 2003 was due primarily to the following: the change in accounting for sales in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan") increased international net sales by 29.0 percentage points; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased international net sales by 12.4 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar); and increased sales of cardiac surgery and vascular products (see below). The increase in international net sales for 2002 was due primarily to the following: the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased international net sales by 10.4 percentage points; and increased sales of cardiac surgery products (see below). The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and Edwards Lifesciences hedging activities. For more information see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk." Net Sales by Product Line The following is a summary of net sales by product line (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Percent Change 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 Cardiac Surgery $ 426.6 $ 365.9 $ 329.0 16.6 % 11.2 % Critical Care 278.8 230.3 209.9 21.1 % 9.7 % Vascular 55.9 51.3 49.3 9.0 % 4.1 % Perfusion 54.8 43.2 102.1 26.9 % (57.7 %) Other Distributed Products 44.4 13.3 1.8 233.8 % 638.9 % Total net sales $ 860.5 $ 704.0 $ 692.1 22.2 % 1.7 % 24  Cardiac Surgery The net sales growth of cardiac surgery products in 2003 resulted primarily from the following: currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 5.5 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar); the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 2.8 percentage points; pericardial tissue valves increased net sales by 4.8 percentage points; and heart valve repair products increased net sales by 1.7 percentage points. The net sales growth of cardiac surgery products in 2002 resulted primarily from the following: pericardial tissue valves increased net sales by 7.9 percentage points; heart valve repair products increased net sales by 1.9 percentage points; and the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 1.1 percentage points. Management expects that its heart valve therapy products will continue to serve as a key driver of Edwards Lifesciences sales growth. Beginning in January 2004, the heart valve therapy products will be in a separate product category called Heart Valve Therapy and the remaining cardiac surgery products will be included in Cardiac Surgery Systems. Critical Care The net sales growth of critical care products in 2003 resulted primarily from the following: the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 10.0 percentage points; currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 6.9 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar); and strong sales in global pressure monitoring products and overall strong performance in emerging global markets. The net sales growth of critical care products in 2002 resulted primarily from the following: the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 4.2 percentage points; increased sales of access, hemofiltration and advanced catheter products; and the net sales growth was partially offset by the decline in base hemodynamic catheters sales, which decreased net sales by 1.4 percentage points. Critical care products have been, and are expected to be, significant contributors to the Companys total sales. Vascular The net sales growth of vascular products for 2003 resulted primarily from the following: currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 7.0 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar); the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 4.0 percentage points; Lifepath AAA sales increased net sales by 2.4 percentage points, primarily in Europe; and net sales growth was partially offset by continued declines in base vascular products. 25 The net sales growth of vascular products for 2002 resulted primarily from the following: initial sales of Lifepath AAA increased net sales by 5.1 percentage points; the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 1.6 percentage points; and net sales growth was partially offset by continued declines in base vascular products. In December 2003, the Company announced its intent to explore strategic alternatives for the Lifepath AAA program. Lifepath AAA sales in 2003 were $4.7 million. Perfusion The net sales growth of perfusion for 2003 resulted primarily from the following: the change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 33.4 percentage points; currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 5.3 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar); the net sales growth was partially offset by the sale of the Companys German perfusion services subsidiary in July 2003, which decreased net sales by 4.7 percentage points; and the reduction of low margin distributed product sales in North America, which decreased net sales by 6.5 percentage points. The net sales decrease of perfusion for 2002 resulted primarily from the following: the sale of the Companys U.S. perfusion services business in June 2001 decreased net sales by 59.8 percentage points; currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased net sales by 2.6 percentage points (primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real against the United States dollar, offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar); the ongoing reduction of sales in Western Europe and the United States; and the net sales decrease was partially offset by the change in accounting for sales in Japan, which increased global net sales by 5.3 percentage points. Beginning in January 2004, the Perfusion category will no longer be separately reported and all perfusion products and services will be included in Cardiac Surgery Systems. Other Distributed Products Other distributed products include sales of intra aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold through the Companys distribution network in Japan, and miscellaneous pharmaceutical products sold in the United States. The net sales for 2003 and 2002 increased primarily due to the impact of the change in accounting for sales in Japan. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Percentage Point Increase 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 58.2 % 57.5 % 53.2 % 0.7 pts. 4.3 pts. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2003 resulted primarily from improved manufacturing performance (1.9 percentage points) and the benefit of the consolidation of the Japan 26 business effective October 1, 2002 (0.7 percentage points), partially offset by increased hedging expenses (2.1 percentage points). The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2002 resulted primarily from the sale of the U.S. perfusion services business in June 2001 (3.6 percentage points), the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002 (0.7 percentage points), and the benefit of product mix, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates (0.8 percentage points). Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Years Ended December 31, Change 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003 SG&A expenses $ 289.9 $ 227.9 $ 203.2 $ 62.0 $ 24.7 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 33.7 % 32.4 % 29.4 % 1.3 pts. 3.0 pts. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 resulted primarily from the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002 ($34.0 million), the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar ($12.8 million), and activities in support of increased sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 resulted primarily from the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002 ($14.0 million), increased spending on heart valve growth opportunities ($8.6 million) and the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar ($1.6 million). The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2003 resulted primarily from the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002 (1.1 percentage point increase) and foreign currency rate fluctuations (0.2 percentage point increase, primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar). The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2002 resulted primarily from the sale of the U.S. perfusion services business in June 2001 (1.8 percentage points), the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002 (0.7 percentage point increase), foreign currency rate fluctuations (0.3 percentage point increase, primarily the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar), and increased spending on heart valve growth opportunities. Research and Development Expenses Years Ended December 31, Change 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 Research and development expenses $ 72.8 $ 65.2 $ 55.0 $ 7.6 $ 10.2 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 8.5 % 9.3 % 7.9 % (0.8)pts. 1.4 pts. The increases in research and development expenses for 2003 and 2002 resulted primarily from investments in a broad range of interventional technologies, including market expanding endovascular heart valve repair and replacement therapies, investments in the Companys peripheral vascular disease platform and other growth initiatives. The decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2003 resulted primarily from the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002. The increase in 27 research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2002 resulted primarily from investments in the Companys peripheral vascular disease platform and other growth initiatives, partially offset by the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002. Loss on Sale of Stock Effective June 30, 2001, the Company sold the stock of Edwards Lifesciences Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. ("ELCR") to Fresenius Medical Care AG for cash proceeds of $45.0 million (the "ELCR Sale"), resulting in a pre tax loss of $68.2 million (including the write off of $83.0 million of goodwill). ELCR provided and managed perfusionists, monitoring systems, capital equipment and disposable material on a contract service basis to hospitals in the United States and Puerto Rico. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations gives effect to the ELCR Sale as if it had occurred on January 1, 2001, and excludes the $68.2 million loss on the sale. The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations does not purport to be indicative of either the results of future operations or the results of operations that would have occurred had the ELCR Sale been consummated on January 1, 2001. The following amounts are in millions, except per share amounts: Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales $ 631.1 Net income 45.9 Net loss per share: Basic 0.78 Diluted 0.75 Asset Impairments 2002 In September 2002, the Company recorded a $67.4 million charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of World Heart Corporation ("WorldHeart"). The investment was written down to $6.2 million, which represented the value of the Companys preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at October 15, 2002 (the closing date of Septembers books). The decision to record the charge was based primarily on WorldHearts September 2002 decision to refocus its product development efforts by adopting a new design concept for a next generation product that resulted in a significant delay (approximately two years) in its product development timeline (with a revised commercial launch date of 2007) and impaired WorldHearts competitive position. Accordingly, the Company concluded that sufficient risk existed that WorldHeart may be unable to fully liquidate the Companys investment in WorldHearts preferred stock. The Company believed that the best objective indicator of the then fair value of its investment in WorldHearts preferred stock was the market price of WorldHearts common stock based upon the Companys expectation that the value of its preferred stock investment would be realized through the common stock, as opposed to redemption of the preferred stock. 2001 Based upon the non strategic nature and declining profitability of certain products in the Companys portfolio (including certain distributed products), the Company decided during the quarter ended June 30, 2001 to discontinue its sales effort of these products. The long lived assets and the investments related to these products were evaluated to determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date. As a result, Edwards Lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of the products or investments over the estimated lives of the related assets were 28 sufficient to recover their costs. Where such cash flows were insufficient, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of assets or investments and recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values. As a result of this evaluation, Edwards Lifesciences recorded a $14.8 million charge primarily related to the impairment of intangibles ($8.3 million), the impairment of an investment ($5.5 million) and the write down of non productive assets ($1.0 million). Goodwill Amortization The elimination of goodwill amortization commencing in the year 2002 resulted from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (see "Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements"). Effective January 1, 2002, the accounting for goodwill changed from an amortization method to an impairment only approach. Special Charges 2003 Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses ($13.6 million) On February 18, 2003, the Company acquired the endovascular mitral valve repair program of Jomed N.V., a European based provider of products for minimally invasive vascular intervention, for $20.0 million in cash. The acquisition included all technology and intellectual property associated with the program. At the acquisition date, the program, which was less than 50% complete, was involved in testing proprietary prototypes prior to initiating required animal studies and human clinicals. Additional design improvements, bench testing, animal studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling the product in Europe (expected in 2005) and in the United States (expected in 2006). The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of animal and clinical studies and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. The fair market value of the assets acquired consisted primarily of patents that are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 17 years. Approximately $11.8 million of the purchase price has been charged to in process research and development. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 30%. The valuation assumed approximately $20.0 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, material net cash inflows were forecasted to commence in 2008. As of December 31, 2003, the program remains reasonably on track with the Companys original expectations. On December 5, 2003, the Company acquired the stock of Whitland Research Limited ("Whitland") for $3.2 million in cash, although achievement of future milestones through 2006 could increase the total price to $5.6 million. Whitland was focused on the development of critical care monitoring technologies. The $3.2 million purchase price was allocated to acquired in process research and development ($1.8 million) and patents ($1.4 million) based upon their estimated fair values. The patents will be amortized over their estimated useful life of 10 years. Severance Charge ($13.0 million) In July 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $13.0 million associated with a decision to streamline operations. The charge was primarily related to the severance costs associated with reducing the Companys worldwide workforce by 136 employees, primarily in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2003, $4.1 million of the charge remained unpaid. 29 Baxter Arbitration Settlement ($5.3 million) In January 2004, the Company concluded a dispute resolution proceeding with Baxter. Each company sought reimbursement from the other for a variety of claims arising from the Companys spin off from Baxter in April 2000. The resolution resulted in a $5.3 million charge primarily related to the valuation of receivables at the date of spin off, and a $5.4 million increase to Additional Contributed Capital related to the true up of the beginning balance of equity. Loss on Sale of Business ($3.3 million) Effective July 4, 2003, the Company sold its German perfusion services subsidiary to WKK GmbH, a German based provider of hospital services, for a nominal amount. Sales generated by the German perfusion services subsidiary were approximately $3.5 million, during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and $6.6 million for the year 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges," the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.3 million in 2003 to reduce the carrying value of the subsidiarys assets to fair value based upon the proceeds from the sale. Pension Curtailment ($1.9 million) On November 4, 2003, the Company suspended its defined benefit pension plan in Puerto Rico ("the Plan"). Effective December 31, 2003, employees do not earn additional defined benefits for future services. To mitigate the Puerto Rico employees reduced benefits from the Plans suspension, effective January 1, 2004, the Company increased its contributions to the Puerto Rico 1165(e) defined contribution plan. In accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," the Company recorded a curtailment loss of $1.9 million during the fourth quarter 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the Plans accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of its assets by $2.4 million. 2002 The Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory expenses related to the October 2002 acquisition of the cardiovascular business in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan"). Equity Earnings in Japan Operations Equity earnings in Japan operations was $11.0 million and $16.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Equity earnings in Japan operations represent the Companys 90% profit interest in the cardiovascular business in Japan effective from April 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. The decrease in 2002 results primarily from the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002. For more information, see "Joint Venture in Japan." Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net was $13.2 million, $11.5 million and $22.9 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net for 2003 resulted primarily from the higher interest rate associated with the Companys fixed rate debt. The decrease in interest expense, net for 2002 resulted primarily from (a) the Companys reduction of debt, (b) lower interest rates on its floating rate debt, and (c) a $6.2 million charge in 2001 related to a payment to unwind an interest rate swap agreement that had locked in a fixed interest rate on $75.0 million of floating rate debt. The decision to unwind the interest rate swap agreement resulted from the Companys pay down of underlying floating rate debt not anticipated to be necessary in funding future requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. 30  Other (Income) Expense, net The following is a summary of other (income) expense, net (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Foreign exchange (gain) loss $ (10.6 ) $ (4.1 ) $ 5.0 Legal settlement, net (14.7 ) Asset dispositions and write downs 3.6 2.3 6.5 Investment write offs 1.4 Accounts receivable securitization costs 0.8 1.5 1.4 Other 1.5 (1.8 ) (2.3 ) $ (4.7 ) $ (15.4 ) $ 10.6 Foreign exchange gains and losses relate to global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances. Effective April 24, 2002, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic, Inc. entered into an agreement related to certain patent infringement claims pursuant to which the Company received a one time cash payment of $20.0 million (recorded as a gain of $14.7 million, net of legal expenses). Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were impacted by several items as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Income tax expense (benefit) at U.S. federal statutory rate $ 32.5 $ 19.6 $ (2.9 ) Foreign income tax at different rates (11.9 ) (10.6 ) (6.8 ) Deemed dividend from Japan, net of foreign tax credit 6.2 Tax credits, federal and state (2.1 ) (1.9 ) (1.6 ) (Benefit) from Brazil reorganization (13.7 ) State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit and transactions listed separately 1.0 (0.1 ) (3.0 ) (Benefit) loss on sale of perfusion services business (20.1 ) 11.0 Valuation allowance for loss on investment 13.8 Nondeductible goodwill 6.0 Other 1.8 (0.4 ) (1.2 ) Income tax expense $ 13.8 $ 0.3 $ 1.5 Excluding the impact of special charges, the effective income tax rate was 26.0% for both 2003 and 2002, and 28.0% for 2001. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2002 was due primarily to the elimination of non deductible goodwill amortization upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. For more information see "Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements." The Company expects its effective income tax rate for recurring operations will increase to 27% for 2004 due in part to the expiration of the research credit. During 2003, the Company commenced a legal reorganization of its Brazil subsidiary to improve its balance sheet and to enhance its ability to conduct business in Brazil. Since being acquired a number of years ago, this subsidiary has incurred net operating losses primarily due to the devaluation of the local 31 currency and interest expense incurred on inter company debt. In addition, the reorganization allowed the Company to recognize the accumulated losses and inter company debt write off under United States tax law, resulting in federal and state tax benefits of $13.7 million. During 2003, the Company recapitalized its Japan subsidiary. As a result, a deemed dividend occurred for U.S. tax purposes resulting in an incremental tax provision of $6.2 million, net of foreign tax credits. The recapitalization was a one time event and all of the future earnings of the Companys Japan subsidiary are intended to be permanently reinvested. In exchange for the sale of the Novacor mechanical cardiac assist product line to WorldHeart in June 2000, the Company received WorldHeart preferred stock. In 2002, the investment in the WorldHeart preferred stock was deemed to be impaired and written down to its fair market value. Due to the uncertainty of using any potential tax benefit for the loss, a valuation allowance of $13.8 million has been established. As a result of tax law developments in 2002, the Company recorded a $20.1 million tax benefit during 2002 related to the loss on sale of its United States perfusion services business in June 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities, proceeds from a convertible debt offering, accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash from operations. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had two unsecured revolving credit agreements providing for up to an aggregate of $530.0 million in one to six month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate (LIBOR) plus 0.75%, which includes a facility fee. One of the credit agreements provides for long term borrowings up to an aggregate of $430.0 million and expires on March 30, 2005 (the "Five Year Credit Facility"). The other credit agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of $100.0 million through March 25, 2004 (the "364 Day Facility"). As the 364 Day Facility has not been used recently, the Company does not plan to renew this credit agreement when it expires. As of December 31, 2003, borrowings of $105.8 million were outstanding under the Five Year Credit Facility and no borrowings were outstanding under the 364 Day Facility. Edwards Lifesciences pays a facility fee, regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.15% for the Five Year Credit Facility and 0.125% for the 364 Day Facility. As of December 31, 2003, all amounts outstanding under the Five Year Credit Facility have been classified as long term obligations, as these borrowings will continue to be refinanced pursuant to that credit agreement. In March 2004, the Company will reclassify any balance outstanding on the Five Year Credit Facility to short term as the agreement will expire within one year. The credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2003. In May 2003, the Company issued $150.0 million of convertible senior debentures, issued at par, bearing an interest rate of 3.875% per annum due May 15, 2033 (the "Notes"). Interest is payable semi annually in May and November. Issuance costs of approximately $3.6 million are being amortized to interest expense over 5 years. The Notes are convertible into 18.29 shares of the Companys common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (conversion price of $54.66 per share), subject to 32 adjustment. The Notes may be converted, at the option of the holders, on or prior to the final maturity date under any of the following circumstances: during any fiscal quarter, if the closing sale price per share of the Companys common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price; if the Notes have been called for redemption; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest on May 15, 2008, 2013, and 2018. The Company will pay cash for all Notes so purchased on May 15, 2008. For any Notes purchased by the Company on May 15, 2013 or 2018, the Company may, at its option, choose to pay the purchase price in cash, in shares of the Companys common stock, or any combination thereof. The Company must pay all accrued and unpaid interest in cash. The Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at any time on or after May 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six month interest period commencing May 15, 2008, holders of the Notes will receive contingent interest at a rate of 0.25% if the trading price of the Notes equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amounts of the Notes. This contingent interest payment feature represents an embedded derivative. Based on the immaterial value associated with this feature, no value has been assigned to the derivative at issuance or at December 31, 2003. As further discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has two securitization programs whereby certain subsidiaries in the United States and Japan sell, without recourse, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of accounts receivable. The significant benefits of the securitizations are lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity. The Company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to borrowings under the current LIBOR based credit facility. Additionally, the Company believes that in diversifying its funding sources, the Companys funding availability in the capital markets is strengthened. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had sold a total of $91.2 million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of $76.9 million. These proceeds are generally used to reduce revolving lines of credit. The securitization program in the United States is renewable for one year periods at the Companys option and will expire on December 21, 2004. The securitization program in Japan will expire on December 3, 2005. In November 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to 2.0 million shares of the Companys outstanding common stock. This program was completed in 2003. In addition, on May 6, 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved a second stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase an additional 2.0 million shares of the Companys outstanding common stock through December 31, 2005. Stock repurchased under these programs will primarily be used to offset obligations under the Companys employee stock option programs. During 2003, the Company repurchased 1,766,300 shares at an aggregate cost of $49.4 million under the second stock repurchase program. Cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased $1.7 million from 2002 due primarily to: higher earnings in 2003 before non cash charges and credits; decreased net cash outflows from accounts and other receivables; decreased net cash outflows from accounts payable and accrued expenses; 33 partially offset by reduced cash inflows from increases in inventories. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 increased $19.4 million from 2001 due primarily to: higher earnings in 2002 before non cash charges and credits; increased net cash inflows from reductions in inventory; partially offset by increased net cash outflows from accounts and other receivables (primarily the 2002 securitization of Japan receivables); and increased net cash outflows from accounts payables and accrued expenses. Cash used in investing activities in 2003 decreased $5.0 million from 2002 due primarily to the following: acquisition of joint venture in Japan of $19.0 million in 2002; decreased spending in 2003 on capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries; receipt of payment on a note receivable in 2003; partially offset by the 2003 purchase of Jomeds intellectual property (see "Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses") and the 2003 purchase of the technology and intellectual property associated with Embol X Inc.s surgically placed, intra aortic embolic management system. The total consideration for Embol X Inc. was $13.6 million, comprised of $8.0 million cash, a deferred payment of $2.0 million cash payable upon the completion of the technology transfer (which was completed during August 2003), stock in an unconsolidated affiliated company valued at $3.0 million and $0.6 million of capitalized transaction costs. In accordance with the guidance provided in Emerging Issues Task Force 98 3, "Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive Assets or of a Business," the transaction was accounted for as a purchased business combination. The purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets at their estimated fair value as follows (in millions): Developed technology $ 6.5 Goodwill 4.4 Patents 1.7 Trademarks and trade names 0.5 Machinery and equipment 0.2 Inventory 0.3 $ 13.6 If prior to April 16, 2008, the Companys sales of medical devices from the transferred technology are at least $20.0 million in any consecutive 12 month period, the Company will pay an additional $5.0 million to Embol X Inc. This contingent obligation has not been recorded in the Companys balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. Forecasted sales of medical devices from the transferred technology are expected to be less than $2.0 million for 2004. Cash used in investing activities in 2002 increased $64.4 million from 2001 due primarily to the cash provided by the sale of the U.S. perfusion services business in 2001, partially offset by the cash used in the acquisition of the Companys joint venture in Japan in 2002. Cash used in financing activities in 2003 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $49.4 million and net payments on debt of $4.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 34 $36.6 million and proceeds from securitization programs of $6.2 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2002 consisted primarily of net payments on debt of $82.1 million and purchases of treasury stock of $30.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from securitization programs of $29.9 million and proceeds from stock plans of $13.7 million. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003 were as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt $ 255.8 $ $ 105.8 $ $ 150.0 Operating leases 36.6 11.1 14.6 8.8 2.1 Unconditional purchase obligations (b) 22.4 7.3 15.0 0.1 Contractual development obligations (a) 31.5 1.7 5.8 24.0 Total contractual cash obligations $ 346.3 $ 20.1 $ 141.2 $ 8.9 $ 176.1 (a)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that Edwards Lifesciences is obligated to pay to unconsolidated affiliates upon their achievement of product development milestones. (b)Unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of minimum purchase commitments of inventory. On January 27, 2004, the Company acquired Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc. ("PVT") for $125.0 million in cash, plus up to an additional $30.0 million upon the achievement of key milestones through 2007. The acquisition was financed through the Companys Five Year Credit Facility and operations. The Company expects to take an initial in process research and development charge related to this transaction in the first quarter of 2004, estimated between $60.0 million and $90.0 million. The remainder of the purchase price will be allocated to patents involving PVTs proprietary technology. PVT, located in Fort Lee, NJ, with a subsidiary in Israel, is a leader in the development of an innovative, catheter based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves. PVTs technology is a combination balloon expandable stent technology integrated with a percutaneously delivered tissue heart valve. Unlike conventional open heart valve replacement surgery, this less invasive procedure is designed to be performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory under local anesthesia. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Companys accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Companys transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions. Management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies. Management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, deferred 35 tax asset valuation allowances, any impairments of assets, anticipated transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers. Revenue related to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process. Total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value of the individual elements, with the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence (generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties). Management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force 01 9 as of January 1, 2002 and presents the cost of certain vendor considerations as reductions of revenue. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include estimates for charge backs, rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions does not properly reflect future activity, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted. The Companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data, as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.1 million and $5.5 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. Inventory reserves result from inventory, which is obsolete, is nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), or is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply). The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $8.5 million and $9.6 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 36  Patent Costs The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable. The related costs are amortized over the remaining useful lives of the patents using the straight line method. Such deferred costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. To the extent the Company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement, costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received. Impairment of Long Lived Assets On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," whereby goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review. As the Companys operations are comprised of one reporting unit, the Company reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the Companys fair value to the net book value of its assets. If the book value of the Companys assets exceeds the Companys fair value, the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. The fair values of certain investments are based on quoted market prices. For other investments, various methods are used to estimate fair value, including external valuations and discounted cash flows. When the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss: the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investees performance against product development milestones; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 37 Income Taxes The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure. New laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates. To the extent the Companys estimates differ from actual payments or assessments, income tax expense is adjusted. Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2003, the Company had deferred tax assets of $107.9 million, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of $17.2 million. The valuation allowance of $19.5 million as of December 31, 2003 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain investments and the net operating loss carryforwards of certain non United States subsidiaries. The Company evaluates annually the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Employee Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," in accounting for its fixed stock option and employee stock purchase plans. In accordance with this intrinsic value method, no compensation expense is recognized for these plans. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net income (loss), as reported $ 79.0 $ 55.7 $ (11.4 ) Deduct: Total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of tax (16.0 ) (15.3 ) (10.8 ) Pro forma net income (loss) $ 63.0 $ 40.4 $ (22.2 ) Earnings per basic share: Reported net income (loss) $ 1.34 $ 0.94 $ (0.19 ) Pro forma net income (loss) 1.07 0.68 (0.38 ) Earnings per diluted share: Reported net income (loss) 1.29 0.91 (0.19 ) Pro forma net income (loss) 1.03 0.66 (0.38 ) 38 The per share weighted average fair value for options granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $10.93, $11.64, and $7.00, respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 Average risk free interest rate 2.5 % 4.4 % 5.8 % Expected dividend yield None None None Expected volatility 42 % 44 % 45 % Expected life (years) 4 5 5 The pro forma expense for employee stock purchase subscriptions was calculated with the following weighted average assumptions for grants during the following periods: 2003 2002 2001 Average risk free interest rate 1.3 % 2.1 % 4.1 % Expected dividend yield None None None Expected volatility 42 % 45 % 44 % Expected life (years) 1 1 1 The expected volatility assumptions for the stock option and stock purchase plans used in the Black Scholes option pricing model is estimated on the date of each grant. Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2001, Edwards Lifesciences adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." This statement replaces SFAS No. 125 and revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral. SFAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. This statement was effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142, which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. No transition adjustment was recorded upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2002. However, adoption of this standard resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization commencing January 1, 2002. See Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for more information. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143, which changes the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144, which changes the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 changes the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity, including certain costs incurred in a 39 restructuring. The provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure." This standard amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this standard amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. This standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted this standard and has made the necessary changes to its financial statement disclosures. In January 2003, the FASB issued and in December 2003, revised, FASB Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51." This interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities, which have certain characteristics. The effective date of this interpretation varies based on certain criteria. The Company is required to apply all of this interpretation no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. The Company is evaluating one entity to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity and if the entity will need to be consolidated. This entity had $10.1 million of assets as of September 30, 2003 and had $0.4 million of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. In April 2003, the FASB issued, SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". This standard is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with exception for specified transactions. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Adoption of this standard did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk, opportunity and costs. Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, option based products and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $569.6 million and $588.2 million, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, option based products, and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, are not a measure of the Companys exposure through its use of derivatives. 40 Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis. The Companys interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate, at specified intervals, calculated on an agreed upon notional amount. As part of its overall risk management program the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 46 basis point increase in interest rates (approximately 10 percent of the Companys weighted average interest rate) affecting the Companys financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments, would not change the Companys annual interest expense, net because the Company has no floating rate debt, after giving effect to interest rate swaps. In January 2004, the Company borrowed $105.0 million on its floating rate Five Year Credit Facility to fund its general operating activities and the acquisition of PVT. Currency Risk The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese yen and the Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net United States dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option based products consist primarily of purchased put options in conjunction with written (sold) call options to create collars. Option based products are agreements that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels. As part of its risk management process, the Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, with a 95 percent confidence level, using spot and three month implied volatilities as stochastic variables and correlations (as of the measurement date) to estimate this potential loss. The Companys calculated VAR at December 31, 2003 and 2002, with a maturity of up to one year, is $3.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively. This amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Companys calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Companys 41 portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future. Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counter party diversification, monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2003 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2003, all derivative financial instruments, based on notional amounts, were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "AA" or better by national rating agencies. The Company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of December 31, 2003; the Company has not experienced any counterparty default during the three years ended December 31, 2003. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the health care industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses which, when realized, have been within the range of managements allowance for doubtful accounts during all periods presented. Sales to Baxter, acting in the capacity of the Companys distributor subsequent to the Distribution, represented approximately 8% and 11% of the Companys total net sales for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Substantially all of these agreements had been terminated as of December 31, 2002. In 2003, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net. Investment Risk Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies. These investments are classified in "Investments in unconsolidated affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2002, the Company recorded a $67.4 million pretax charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of WorldHeart. The investment was written down to $6.2 million, which represented the value of the Companys preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at October 15, 2002. The decision to record the charge was based primarily on delays in WorldHearts product development timelines, arising from its revised strategy. Should WorldHeart fail to meet certain future development and financing milestones, further impairment charges may be necessary. In addition to the investment in WorldHeart ($11.6 million at December 31, 2003), Edwards Lifesciences had approximately $23.8 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies. At December 31, 2003, the Company had recorded unrealized gains of $4.3 million and unrealized losses of $4.8 million on these investments in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income," net of tax. Management considers these declines temporary in nature based upon the individual companies operating results, financial condition and achievement of product development milestones. Should these 42 companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary.
