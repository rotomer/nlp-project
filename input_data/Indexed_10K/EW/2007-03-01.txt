Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2006. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2006. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview Edwards Lifesciences is a global provider of products and technologies that are designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences focuses on providing products and technologies to address specific cardiovascular opportunities: heart valve disease; critical care technologies; and peripheral vascular disease. 24 The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease are categorized into five main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; Vascular; and Other Distributed Products. Edwards Lifesciences Heart Valve Therapy portfolio is comprised of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products. A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the Critical Care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients heart function and in disposable pressure transducers, and also provides central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery. The Companys Cardiac Surgery Systems portfolio comprises a diverse line of products for use during cardiac surgery including cannula, transmyocardial revascularization ("TMR") technology and other disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Edwards Lifesciences Vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, artificial implantable grafts, and stents used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Lastly, Other Distributed Products include sales of intra aortic balloon pumps and other products sold primarily though the Companys distribution network in Japan. The healthcare marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors. Global demand for healthcare is increasing as the population ages. There is mounting pressure to contain healthcare costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. Management expects these trends to continue. Results of Operations Net Sales Trends The following is a summary of United States and international net sales (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2006 2005 United States $ 477.9 $ 455.9 $ 416.5 $ 22.0 $ 39.4 4.8 % 9.5 % Europe 264.6 241.3 221.2 23.3 20.1 9.7 % 9.1 % Japan 168.8 186.4 197.2 (17.6 ) (10.8 ) (9.4 )% (5.5 )% Intercontinental 125.7 114.3 96.6 11.4 17.7 10.0 % 18.3 % International 559.1 542.0 515.0 17.1 27.0 3.2 % 5.2 % Total net sales $ 1,037.0 $ 997.9 $ 931.5 $ 39.1 $ 66.4 3.9 % 7.1 % The $22.0 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2006 was due primarily to increased sales of Critical Care, Heart Valve Therapy and Vascular products. The net sales increase in Critical Care products of $10.7 million was primarily driven by sales of the new FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system and advanced hemodynamic products. The net sales increase in Heart Valve Therapy products of $8.2 million was primarily driven by the continuing penetration of the Companys premium Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna and Magna with ThermaFix valves. The net sales increase in Vascular products of $4.7 million was primarily driven by sales of LifeStent products. 25 The $17.1 million increase in international net sales in 2006 was due primarily to increases in Critical Care, Heart Valve Therapy and Vascular products. The net sales increase in Critical Care products of $15.9 million was primarily driven by sales of the new FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system throughout international locations and advanced hemodynamic products in Europe. The net sales increase in Heart Valve Therapy products of $14.9 million was primarily driven by increased valve sales in Japan and Europe. The net sales increase in Vascular products of $4.4 million was primarily driven by sales of LifeStent products in Europe. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales due primarily from the sale in 2005 of the Companys perfusion products in Japan, which decreased net sales by $13.8 million, and to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Brazilian real against the United States dollar), which decreased net sales by $5.2 million. The $39.4 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2005 was due primarily to increased sales in Heart Valve Therapy products driven by the continuing penetration of the Companys Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna and Magna with ThermaFix valves, resulting in market share gains. The $27.0 million increase in international net sales in 2005 was due primarily to (1) Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $17.6 million, driven by strong Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT valve sales in Europe, (2) Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $11.4 million, driven by sales of hemofiltration products in Europe and pressure monitoring products in Intercontinental, (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $6.9 million (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Brazilian real against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar) and (4) Vascular and Cardiac Surgery products in Europe and Japan, which increased net sales by $6.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $22.6 million due to the impact of discontinued products, primarily in Japan. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Companys hedging activities.

Net Sales by Product Line The following is a summary of net sales by product line (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2006 2005 Heart Valve Therapy $ 490.8 $ 469.3 $ 419.2 $ 21.5 $ 50.1 4.6 % 12.0 % Critical Care 349.8 324.1 302.3 25.7 21.8 7.9 % 7.2 % Cardiac Surgery Systems 91.0 104.6 107.3 (13.6 ) (2.7 ) (13.0 )% (2.5 )% Vascular 75.9 66.1 60.1 9.8 6.0 14.8 % 10.0 % Other Distributed Products 29.5 33.8 42.6 (4.3 ) (8.8 ) (12.7 )% (20.7 )% Total net sales $ 1,037.0 $ 997.9 $ 931.5 $ 39.1 $ 66.4 3.9 % 7.1 % 26  Heart Valve Therapy The $21.5 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2006 was due primarily to: pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $20.8 million, primarily as a result of the Companys premium Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna and Magna with ThermaFix valves; and heart valve repair products, which increased net sales by $9.0 million, primarily as a result of the continuing adoption of the Companys newest products including the Edwards MC3, IMR ETlogix and GeoForm rings. These increases in 2006 were partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $2.6 million (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar) and the continuing decline in net sales of porcine and mechanical valves. During 2006, the Companys sales growth in Heart Valve Therapy was negatively impacted by the introduction in the United States of a competitors valve late in 2005. This activity primarily impacted the Companys conversion of competitor mechanical valves to the Companys tissue valves. The $50.1 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2005 was due primarily to: pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $37.0 million, primarily as a result of market share gains globally of the Companys premium Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna valve, particularly in the United States; heart valve repair products, which increased net sales by $10.1 million, primarily driven by the continuing adoption of the Companys new disease specific technologies; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased heart valve therapy net sales by $1.8 million (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Brazilian real against the United States dollar, offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). The Company expects that its PERIMOUNT Magna and Magna with ThermaFix valves will continue to be a strong contributor to 2007 sales growth. In January 2007, the Company launched two new products in the United States. The new PERIMOUNT Theon aortic valve offers clinicians the durability and hemodynamics of the PERIMOUNT technology with the addition of the ThermaFix tissue treatment, and the new Myxo ETlogix annuloplasty ring is the first mitral repair product specifically designed to address mxyomatous disease. The Company anticipates that both of these products will contribute to growth in Heart Valve Therapy in 2007. In addition, the Company is planning to launch its next generation aortic valve, the Magna Ease valve, in Europe in 2007. The Companys new PERIMOUNT Magna mitral valve is gaining physician acceptance in Europe and the Company anticipates FDA approval in the United States by the end of 2007. In addition, the Company is planning on launching a new PERIMOUNT mitral valve in Japan in 2007. The Company has decided to exit the mechanical valve market by the end of 2007. Sales of mechanical valves were approximately $12.0 million in 2006. 27 Critical Care The $25.7 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2006 was due primarily to: recently launched FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $11.2 million; core critical care products, which increased net sales by $8.6 million, driven primarily by market share gains in advanced technology catheter products and pressure monitoring products; and hemofiltration products, which increased net sales by $6.9 million. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased net sales by $2.2 million in 2006 (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). The $21.8 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2005 was due primarily to: core critical care products, which increased net sales by $12.7 million, driven primarily by market share gains in advanced technology catheter products and pressure monitoring products; an expanded hemofiltration product line, which increased net sales by $5.8 million; and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $2.2 million (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Brazilian real against the United States dollar, offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). The Company launched its FloTrac system in Japan in early April 2006 and expects worldwide FloTrac system sales to be a significant contributor to Critical Care sales growth in 2007. Cardiac Surgery Systems The $13.6 million decrease in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems in 2006 was due primarily to the sale of the Companys perfusion product line in Japan in 2005, which decreased net sales by $13.8 million, and a decline in TMR sales. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of specialty cannula products, driven primarily by market share gains. The $2.7 million decrease in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems in 2005 was due primarily to the sale of the Companys perfusion product line in Japan in January 2005 and the sale of the Companys Italian perfusion services products in June 2004, which together decreased net sales by $9.6 million. The decreases were partially offset by: cannula products, which increased net sales by $2.8 million, driven primarily by market share gains and a shift to specialty products; and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $2.2 million (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Brazilian real against the United States dollar, offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). In December 2006, the Company announced the discontinuation of the Optiwave 980 Cardiac Laser Ablation System, which generated approximately $1 million of sales in 2006, and completed the sale of the Brazil based international perfusion business (see "Special (Gains) Charges, net"). 28 Vascular The $9.8 million increase in net sales of Vascular products in 2006 was due primarily to sales of LifeStent products. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company made enhancements to its new FlexStar delivery system and upgraded the United States field inventory to the new system. In addition, in the third quarter of 2006, the Company introduced a new line of longer length stents, FlexStar XL, in the United States. The $6.0 million increase in net sales of Vascular products in 2005 was due primarily to: LifeStent products, which increased net sales by $5.7 million; and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $0.8 million (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Brazilian real against the United States dollar, offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). The 2005 increases were partially offset by the discontinuation of the Lifepath AAA program in June 2004. Other Distributed Products The $4.3 million decrease in net sales of Other Distributed Products in 2006 was due primarily to exiting the Japan pacemaker business in the first quarter of 2005 and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $1.2 million (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). In May 2006, the Company divested a non strategic pharmaceutical product representing approximately $1 million in annual sales. The $8.8 million decrease in net sales of Other Distributed Products in 2005 was due primarily to the discontinuation of sales in Japan of certain lower margin distributed cardiology products in September 2004 and the exit from the Japan pacemaker business during the first quarter of 2005. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 64.0 % 62.5 % 60.3 % 1.5 pts. 2.2 pts. The 1.5 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2006 was driven by the Companys international operations. The increase in international gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by (1) a 0.8 percentage point increase from the discontinuation of lower margin products and (2) a 0.6 percentage point increase from the favorable impact of foreign currency, including the expiration of currency hedging contracts. These increases were partially offset by a 0.5 percentage point decrease from unfavorable product mix in the international Vascular and Critical Care product lines. The United States gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 0.5 percentage points due to favorable product mix, primarily in the Heart Valve Therapy product line. The 2.2 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 was due primarily to (1) a 1.3 percentage point increase from the favorable impact of foreign currency, 29 including the expiration of currency hedging contracts and (2) sales of higher margin heart valve products, primarily in the United States. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses (in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 SG&A expenses $ 376.0 $ 348.7 $ 319.9 $ 27.3 $ 28.8 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 36.3 % 34.9 % 34.3 % 1.4pts. 0.6 pts. The $27.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 was due primarily to stock based compensation expense of $12.9 million, as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), and higher sales and marketing expenses primarily related to the Companys Heart Valve Therapy product line and new products in the United States. The 1.4 percentage point increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2006 was due primarily to stock based compensation expense. The $28.8 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 resulted primarily from higher sales and marketing expenses of $19.0 million, primarily related to the Companys United States peripheral stent and heart valve therapy products, higher international expenses of $2.3 million due to foreign exchange rates, and higher legal and consulting expenses. The 0.6 percentage point increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2005 was due primarily to an increased investment in United States sales and marketing expenses related to peripheral stents. Research and Development Expenses (in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Research and development expenses $ 114.2 $ 99.0 $ 87.0 $ 15.2 $ 12.0 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 11.0 % 9.9 % 9.3 % 1.1pts. 0.6 pts. The increases in research and development expenses in 2006 and 2005 were due primarily to additional investments in the Companys transcatheter valve programs. In addition, in 2006, research and development expenses increased by $3.7 million as a result of adopting SFAS 123R. In the Companys transcatheter aortic valve replacement program, the Company has made clinical and technological progress. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company introduced its Edwards SAPIEN THV, a transcatheter bovine valve treated with the Companys ThermaFix tissue treatment, formerly called Cribier Edwards PHV. The Edwards SAPIEN THV valve can be delivered using either the RetroFlex delivery system through a transfemoral approach or the Ascendra delivery system through 30 a transapical approach. The Company has completed enrollment in its transfemoral feasibility trial in the United States. In addition, the Company has demonstrated the feasibility of its transapical procedures in its European and Canadian studies. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company began enrollment in a transapical feasibility trial in the United States. The Company expects to begin its pivotal trials in the United States in the first quarter of 2007 and expects receipt of a CE mark by the end of 2007. In the Companys transcatheter mitral valve repair program, the Company has two technologies: the Edwards MONARC mitral repair system, a coronary sinus technology, and the Edwards MOBIUS leaflet repair system. For the Edwards MONARC technology, the Company is continuing its 60 patient EVOLUTION I feasibility trial and anticipates its completion by the first quarter of 2007. If feasibility is established, the Company plans to initiate the EVOLUTION II follow on trial, which will measure clinical and quality of life endpoints. Data gathered from the EVOLUTION II trial would support a CE Mark and would help to support a pivotal trial in the United States as early as 2008. For the Edwards MOBIUS technology, the Companys feasibility work is continuing in Europe and Canada. The Company implemented several procedural and device enhancements in 2006 to address a broader range of patients and leaflets. Interim feasibility results led to the implementation of additional enhancements to improve repair durability. As a result, the Company expects its feasibility studies to continue into 2007, at which point the Company will assess the performance of the system and develop plans accordingly. Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses The information in "Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses," related to regulatory milestones, describes the Companys expectations with respect to the applicable programs at the time of the respective acquisitions and does not reflect subsequent activities or expectations. Refer to "Research and Development Expenses," above, for the current status of these programs and the Companys expectations. 2005 In September 2005, the Company recorded a $1.2 million pretax charge for in process research and development related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property. The acquired assets are expected to be utilized in the Companys existing mitral valve repair research and development efforts. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. 2004 On September 29, 2004, the Company acquired all technology and intellectual property associated with ev3, Inc.s ("ev3") percutaneous mitral valve repair program for total consideration of $15.0 million. The acquired assets were expected to be utilized in the Companys existing percutaneous mitral valve repair research and development efforts. At the time of the purchase, ev3 had been unsuccessful in developing a viable prototype and had discontinued the program. Completion of successful design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies were required prior to selling any product. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing 31 development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $12.3 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 30%. The valuation assumed approximately $39.0 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, the Company estimated completion of the mitral valve repair program utilizing the intellectual property acquired from ev3 in 2009, and commencement of net cash inflows in 2010. The remaining fair market value of the assets purchased consisted primarily of patents unrelated to ev3s core mitral valve repair technology, which are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 19 years. On January 27, 2004, the Company acquired Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc. ("PVT"), a development stage company, for $125.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus up to an additional $30.0 million upon the achievement of key milestones through 2007 (see "Special (Gains) Charges, net"). Included in PVTs technology is a catheter based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves, comprised of a proprietary percutaneously delivered balloon expandable stent technology integrated with a tissue heart valve. Unlike conventional open heart valve replacement surgery, this less invasive procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and could potentially be a breakthrough for patients seeking an alternative to open heart surgery. At the time of acquisition, the PVT aortic heart valve was being used in compassionate cases in Europe, and these clinical results had generated valuable feasibility data. It had been demonstrated that a heart valve could be successfully deployed and anchored using a catheter based system. Also at that time, the Company was expecting to obtain a CE mark in Europe by the end of 2005 and to file for a Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") in the United States. Upon approval of the HDE, the Company would be able to offer this device to as many as 4,000 patients per year. Broader commercialization in the United States was expected to begin with the submission of an IDE by the end of the second quarter of 2004 followed by the commencement of a pivotal trial in 2005 and possible pre market approval by the end of 2007. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time included those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $81.0 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development in 2004. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 25%. The valuation assumed approximately $20.9 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, net cash inflows were forecasted to commence in 2007. The remaining fair market value of the net assets acquired consisted primarily of patents of $72.4 million that are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 11 years, and a deferred tax liability related to the patents of $28.1 million. 32 Special (Gains) Charges, net Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Settlements and litigation (gains) losses, net $ (20.2 ) $ 2.9 $ Gain on sale of assets, net (13.7 ) (14.1 ) (7.4 ) PVT milestone 10.0 Realignment expenses, net 9.4 3.9 Discontinued products 6.8 1.4 10.6 Restructure 3F agreements 2.0 22.8 Litigation reserve 1.2 Investment impairments 16.3 9.0 Charitable fund contributions 15.0 5.0 Total special (gains) charges, net $ (4.5 ) $ 48.2 $ 17.2 Settlements and Litigation (Gains) Losses, net In January 2006, the Company recorded a patent dispute settlement gain of $20.2 million, which consisted of a net payment of $23.8 million received from Medtronic, Inc., offset by patent enforcement costs. In September 2005, the Company recorded a gain of $2.5 million related to the resolution of intellectual property litigation. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a $5.4 million charge related to two royalty dispute settlements. Gain on Sale of Assets, net In December 2006, the Company sold its assets associated with the Companys angiogenesis research and development project to Sangamo BioSciences Inc. ("Sangamo") in exchange for 1.0 million shares of Sangamo common stock. The Company recorded a $6.1 million gain, which represents the fair value of the common stock on the closing date, less the book value of the assets sold. In May 2006, the Company sold a non strategic pharmaceutical product to Bioniche Teoranta for $9.0 million. The sale of the related assets resulted in a $4.5 million gain, consisting of cash proceeds of $9.0 million, offset by $4.5 million related primarily to the net book value of intangible assets and inventory that were sold. In the second quarter of 2006, the Company agreed to sell most of its assets related to its remaining international cardiopulmonary perfusion product line. The Company determined that the carrying values of the underlying assets exceeded their fair values. Consequently, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), in the second quarter of 2006, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.6 million, which represented the excess of the carrying values of the assets over their fair values, and included direct incremental 33 costs to transact the sale of $1.5 million. The sale was completed in December 2006 and no additional gain or loss was recorded. In November 2005, the Company sold its vascular graft business to Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $14.0 million in cash. Under the agreement, the Company will continue to market and sell its existing Lifespan products. The sale of the business resulted in a $13.1 million net gain, consisting of cash proceeds of $14.0 million offset by the $0.9 million net book value of inventory and fixed assets that were sold. In January 2005, the Company announced that it was realigning its business in Japan as part of the Companys continued efforts to focus on its core cardiovascular businesses. The Company (1) restructured its operations, (2) exited its pacemaker distribution business and (3) sold its perfusion product line in Japan to Terumo Corporation for cash consideration of $14.9 million, of which $9.2 million was received in January 2005 and $5.7 million was received in March 2006 as an earn out payment. In 2005, the Company recorded a $1.0 million net gain, consisting of a gain on the sale of the Companys Japan perfusion product line of $7.7 million, offset by a $5.7 million charge related to the realignment of its operations, primarily related to severance costs due to headcount reductions, and a $1.0 million charge related to settlement, curtailment and special termination benefits impacting its defined benefit pension plan. In 2006, the Company recorded a gain of $5.7 million related to the receipt of the earn out payment. As of December 31, 2006, payments related to the realignment were complete. In November 2004, the Company recorded a gain of $7.4 million for the sale of property development rights in Irvine, California, that had no book value at the time of the sale. PVT Milestone In December 2006, the Company recorded a $10.0 million charge for the contractual transcatheter clinical milestone obligation to PVTs former shareholders. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company achieved and paid the $10.0 million to PVTs former shareholders. As all contractual milestone obligation dates have expired, the Company does not expect to make any additional payments to PVTs former shareholders. Realignment Expenses, net In December 2006, the Company recorded a $7.3 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global reduction in workforce of approximately 70 employees, primarily in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2006, the Company paid $0.4 million of severance with the remaining amount expected to be paid out substantially by the end of 2007. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded realignment expenses of $2.1 million related primarily to severance expenses associated with the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in Japan (impacting 92 employees). The Company anticipates payments to be made through the third quarter of 2007. The realignment expenses are net of a $0.4 million reversal of previously accrued severance costs related to the sale of the Japan perfusion product line to Terumo as discussed in the "Gain on Sale of Assets, net" section. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 million had been paid related to these actions. 34 In December 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $3.9 million related to severance resulting from a resource realignment. The charge was related primarily to the severance costs associated with reducing the Companys workforce by 52 employees, primarily in Puerto Rico, Europe and the United States. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had paid $3.7 million related to severance with the remaining amount expected to be paid in 2007. Discontinued Products In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company discontinued the Optiwave 980 Cardiac Laser Ablation System. The Company recorded a $6.8 million charge resulting primarily from the disposal of fixed assets and the write off intangible assets. In addition, the Company recorded a $2.0 million charge to cost of goods sold related to the disposal of inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $1.4 million resulting from the payment of an early termination fee to discontinue certain firm non cancelable product purchase commitments related to a discontinued product line in Europe. In the first quarter of 2004, due to a re prioritization of the Companys investment initiatives, the Company discontinued its sales effort of its Lifepath AAA endovascular graft program. The Company recorded a special charge of $8.4 million primarily related to inventory and contractual clinical obligations. In addition, the Company decided to discontinue certain lower margin cardiology products in Japan later that year and recorded a $2.2 million charge in 2004 primarily related to other non productive assets. Restructure 3F Agreements In June 2005, the Company recorded a special charge of $22.8 million related to the restructuring of development and supply agreements between 3F Therapeutics, Inc. and PVT that were established prior to the Companys acquisition of PVT in early 2004. Under the terms of the new agreements, the Company obtained the rights to self manufacture all components of its transcatheter heart valves and certain pre approved technology licenses. In 2006, the Company paid and recorded an additional $2.0 million for the final payment to 3F Therapeutics for completing certain contractual obligations. Investment Impairments In September 2005, the Company recorded an $8.9 million charge related to the other than temporary impairment of its investment in Sangamo. The investment was written down to $3.7 million, which represented the quoted market price of Sangamos common stock at September 30, 2005. The Company considered numerous facts, including those described below, to conclude that any impairment of the Sangamo investment was temporary in nature as of the end of each of the quarters in 2003 and 2004, and the first two quarters of 2005: Sangamos key internally established development milestones were progressing and or remained on track at each quarter end throughout 2003 and 2004, and the first two quarters of 2005. There were no changes in technology that could impair Sangamos earnings potential of the investment and the technological progress supported a positive outlook. The Company believed 35 that the number and scope of Sangamos programs and the range of its third party collaborations and the continued success in the Companys Sangamo related programs would significantly drive the value of Sangamo. Moreover, the clinical momentum was building at the end of 2004 with the anticipation of three to four Phase I human trials, the likely completion of one or more Phase I trials with positive data and the planned announcements at major medical meetings. Management of the Company believed that declines in Sangamos stock price were a result of certain external events and general investor sentiment of the biotechnology sector, and not Sangamo specific activities. In addition, the Company recognized that, historically, reports of significant positive clinical outcomes had frequently resulted in a significant increase in the stock price of a biotechnology company over a relatively short time period. Management believed this would be the case for Sangamo. Throughout all periods in which the Company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary, Sangamo maintained cash and liquid investment reserves sufficient to continue to fund the ongoing development efforts for the technology for periods well in excess of one year. Throughout all periods in which the Company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary, the Company had the financial ability and intent to retain this investment indefinitely. Sangamos technology was considered important to the development of certain of the Companys next generation products, and required a long term horizon for ongoing development of new technology. Sangamo is a multi technology (human therapeutics, drug discovery and plant agriculture) biotechnology company and has the ability to attract many different investors. In addition, the diversity of technology applications served to dilute the risk related to any one application failure. The Company expected the market price of Sangamos stock to increase not only as a result of announcements of positive clinical trial results, but also other operational events. During the second half of 2005, Sangamo announced five significant key developments regarding collaborative agreements, additional funding and breakthrough technology. The Company expected that this concentration of positive developments could have generated a considerable increase in the stock price, better recognizing the underlying value of Sangamo. Based upon (1) the significant developments in the third quarter of 2005 which, individually and in the aggregate, failed to have a material impact on the quoted market price of Sangamos stock, (2) the continuing duration and severity of the impairment, and (3) Sangamos declining cash position, the Company concluded in September 2005 that the impairment on its investment in Sangamo was other than temporary and, therefore, recognized an $8.9 million charge in earnings. In 2005, the Company recorded additional charges totaling $7.4 million related to other than temporary impairment of technology investments in five other unconsolidated affiliates. Of the total additional charge, $1.9 million related to declines in the stock prices of two available for sale investments. The remaining charges were due to increased potential risk of certain private investees uncertain future liquidity. 36 In 2004, the Company recorded charges totaling $9.0 million related to the other than temporary impairment of technology investments in four unconsolidated affiliates. One of the impairments resulted from the decline in the stock price of an affiliate. Two of the affiliates had announced they were discontinuing their development efforts and the book value of those investments was reduced to the residual distribution Edwards Lifesciences expected to receive from those companies. The remaining affiliate performed a reset financing that reduced the net value per share for all existing investors. This investment is recorded at the reduced value. Charitable Fund In December 2004, the Company made an initial contribution of $5.0 million to establish the Edwards Lifesciences Fund, a donor advised fund intended to provide philanthropic support to cardiovascular disease charitable causes. In September 2005, the Company completed its funding goal and made an additional $15.0 million contribution. Both of these contributions were irrevocable contributions to a third party and were recorded as charges at time of payment. Interest Expense The $1.8 million decrease in interest expense for 2006 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates, which resulted from the expiration of the Companys fixed interest rate swap contracts in the third quarter of 2005, combined with a greater portion of debt in low interest rate countries. The $2.9 million decrease in interest expense for 2005 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates, including the effect of interest rate swaps. Interest Income The $5.2 million increase in interest income for 2006 resulted from higher interest rates and a higher cash and cash equivalent balance. The $1.6 million increase in interest income for 2005 resulted primarily from a higher cash and cash equivalent balance. Other Expense (Income), net The following is a summary of other expense (income), net (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Foreign exchange gains $ (0.3 ) $ (2.1 ) $ (0.2 ) Accounts receivable securitization costs 2.6 1.7 1.0 Other 0.4 0.2 (1.2 ) $ 2.7 $ (0.2 ) $ (0.4 ) Foreign exchange gains relate to the foreign currency fluctuation on the Companys global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances. The increases in securitization costs in 2006 and 2005 were due to increases in average interest rates and higher average securitized balances. 37  Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2006, 2005, and 2004 were impacted as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Income tax expense at U.S. federal statutory rate $ 60.3 $ 40.9 $ 10.5 Foreign income tax at different rates (19.8 ) (16.4 ) (21.5 ) Deemed dividends, net of foreign tax credit 4.2 3.6 2.9 Tax credits, federal and state (2.0 ) (2.0 ) (1.7 ) State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 4.7 0.2 0.8 Valuation allowance for loss on investments (7.0 ) (6.2 ) 6.6 Nondeductible in process research and development expenses and milestone payment 3.5 27.8 Taxes on repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 15.0 Nondeductible stock based compensation 2.2 Reserve for uncertain tax positions for prior years (5.6 ) (0.2 ) 1.5 Other 1.3 2.5 1.5 Income tax provision $ 41.8 $ 37.4 $ 28.4 The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law in October 2004 and allowed companies to repatriate cash during 2004 and 2005 into the United States at a special, temporary effective tax rate of 5.25 percent. On September 13, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a plan for reinvestment and repatriation of specific foreign earnings under the Act. The Company repatriated $263.1 million in cash in 2005. The Company accrued $15.0 million for federal, state and foreign taxes attributable to the distribution from its foreign affiliates in 2005. Beginning in 2002 and through 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are subject to the Company realizing sufficient capital gains with which to offset these capital losses. Due to the uncertainty of the Company realizing future capital gains, the Company has consistently recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated. As December 31, 2006, deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately $4.4 million had accumulated related to investments. During 2005, valuation allowances were made in each quarter against investment impairments recognized. The valuation allowance amounts were $0.2 million in the first quarter, $2.0 million in the second quarter, $3.8 million in the third quarter and $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, for a total for the year of $7.1 million. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company realized a capital gain related to the sale of its vascular graft business and anticipated a capital gain in January 2006 related to the settlement of certain patent litigation against Medtronic (see "Legal Proceedings"). As a result, valuation allowances were reversed, reducing income tax provision during the fourth quarter of 2005 by $13.3 million. Similarly, in 2006, the Company recognized capital gains in the second quarter from the sale of a non strategic business and in the fourth quarter, a gain from the sale of the angiogenesis business and a 38 capital loss on the sale of shares in World Heart Corporation. The capital gains have allowed or will allow the Company to utilize the same amounts of the accumulated losses related to impaired investments. As a result, valuation allowances of $3.7 million and $3.3 million were reversed in the second and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. Of the $81.0 million charge for acquired in process research and development related to the PVT acquisition in 2004, as discussed in "Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses," $1.7 million is related to tax deductible payments to exercise certain licensing options pursuant to the stock purchase agreement. The remaining $79.3 million charge is non deductible for income tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $10.0 million charge for achieving the contractual transcatheter clinical milestone obligation with PVT. The $10.0 million payment is not deductible for income tax purposes. On January 1, 2006 the Company reported results in accordance with SFAS 123R and recognized expense in 2006 related to stock based compensation. Some of those costs are not deductible in the United States or in foreign countries. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, the Company settled several of its ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at anytime. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes is the expected outcome, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The tax reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest, if any, have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations of uncertain tax positions. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities, accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash from operations. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all. On September 29, 2006, the Company extended its Five Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement"), to September 29, 2011. The Credit Agreement provides up to an aggregate of $500.0 million in one to six month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.45%, which includes a facility fee and is subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the Companys leverage ratio, as defined by the Credit Agreement. The Company pays a facility fee regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.8%. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement have been classified as long term obligations, as these borrowings will continue to be refinanced 39 pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Additional issuance costs of $0.5 million are being amortized to interest expense over 5 years. As of December 31, 2006, borrowings of $85.9 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2006. In addition to the Credit Agreement, as of December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding $150.0 million of convertible senior debentures, issued at par, bearing an interest rate of 3.875% per annum due May 15, 2033 (the "Notes"). Interest is payable semi annually in May and November. Issuance costs of approximately $4.4 million are being amortized to interest expense over 5 years. The Notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into 18.29 shares of the Companys common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (at a conversion price of $54.66 per share), subject to adjustment. The Company has two securitization programs whereby certain subsidiaries in the United States and Japan sell, without recourse, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of accounts receivable. The significant benefits of the securitizations are lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity. The Company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to borrowings under the current LIBOR based credit facility. Additionally, the Company believes that in diversifying its funding sources, the Companys funding availability in the capital markets is strengthened. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had sold a total of $85.3 million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of $75.5 million. In September 2006, the United States securitization program was extended to September 18, 2007. The securitization program in Japan expires on December 3, 2008. In May 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to 4.0 million shares of the Companys common stock through December 31, 2008. Stock repurchased under the new program will be used primarily to offset obligations under the Companys employee stock option programs. In 2006, the Company repurchased 3.3 million shares under the new and the previously approved stock repurchase programs at an aggregate cost of $145.9 million and has remaining authority under the new program to purchase 2.7 million shares as of December 31, 2006. On January 23, 2006, the Company settled certain patent litigation against Medtronic. As a result, in January 2006, the Company recorded a gain of $20.2 million, which consisted of the $37.5 million cash offset by the settlement paid to Endogad, capitalized patent enforcement costs of $2.9 million and current legal fees. See Item 3 for additional information. In 2006, the Company notified its employees of its intent to terminate the defined benefit pension plan in Puerto Rico and expects to distribute benefits in early 2008. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company paid PVTs former shareholders $10.0 million for the achievement of a milestone as discussed at "Special (Gains) Charges, net." As all contractual milestone obligation dates have expired, the Company does not expect to make any additional milestone payments to PVTs former shareholders. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $230.8 million for 2006 increased $94.0 million from 2005 primarily due to (1) higher earnings, adjusted for non operating and non cash items, (2) cash received in 2006 from the patent litigation settlement with Medtronic of $23.8 million, (3) a cash payment of $23.0 million made in 2005 related to the restructuring of development and supply 40 agreements and (4) a charitable contribution payment of $15.0 million made in 2005. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted versus 2005 by net cash used to fund working capital requirements, which consisted primarily of net cash outflows for accrued liabilities and taxes payable, partially offset by net cash inflows from accounts receivables due to lower days sales outstanding. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $136.8 million for 2005 decreased $43.8 million from 2004 primarily due to a cash payment of $23.0 million related to the restructuring of development and supply agreements, and a charitable contribution payment of $15.0 million, offset by higher earnings, adjusted for non operating and non cash items. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted versus 2004 by net cash used to fund working capital requirements, which consisted of decreased net cash inflows from receivables due to higher days sales outstanding in the United States, reduced cash flows from increases in inventories to build new product lines and support increased sales levels, partially offset by lower net cash outflows for accrued liabilities and taxes payable. Net cash used by investing activities of $35.7 million in 2006 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $57.4 million, partially offset by proceeds of (1) $9.0 million from the sale of a non strategic pharmaceutical product, (2) $7.5 million from the sale of assets related to the Companys remaining international cardiopulmonary perfusion product line and (3) $5.7 million related to an earn out payment from the 2005 sale of the Companys perfusion product line in Japan. Net cash used by investing activities of $27.2 million in 2005 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $48.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of the Companys vascular graft business of $14.0 million and the Japan perfusion products business of $9.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $193.6 million in 2006 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $145.9 million and net payments on long term debt of $85.9 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $33.5 million. Net cash provided by financing activities of $29.0 million in 2005 consisted primarily of net proceeds from issuance of long term debt of $59.1 million and the proceeds from stock plans of $26.2 million, partially offset by purchases of treasury stock of $53.5 million. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt $ 235.9 $ $ 150.0 $ 85.9 $ Interest on long term debt 8.2 5.8 2.4 Operating leases 34.1 10.9 14.0 7.0 2.2 Contractual development and capital commitment obligations(a)(b) 18.5 12.8 4.0 1.7 Total contractual cash obligations $ 296.7 $ 29.5 $ 170.4 $ 94.6 $ 2.2 (a)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that Edwards Lifesciences is obligated to pay to unconsolidated affiliates upon their achievement of product development milestones. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company paid PVTs former shareholders 41 $10.0 million for the achievement of a milestone as discussed at "Special (Gains) Charges, net" As all contractual milestone obligation dates have expired, the Company does not expect to make any additional milestone payments to PVTs former shareholders. (b)Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that Edwards Lifesciences is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees. These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Companys accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Companys transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions. Management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies. Management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, income taxes, any impairments of assets, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers. Revenue related to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process. Total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value of the individual elements, with 42 the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence (generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties). When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include estimates for charge backs, rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted. The Companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data, as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $6.5 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. Inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), or damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply). The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $13.2 million and $12.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Patent Costs The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable. Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. To the extent the Company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement, costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes the two step goodwill impairment test as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated 43 based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, the Company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value. Additionally, in accordance with SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term, strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development. Certain of these investments are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 3% to 5% of the investees outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded at the amount of the Companys investment and adjusted each period for the Companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid. As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value. When the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss: the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investees performance against product development milestones; and 44 the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Income Taxes The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure. New laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates. To the extent the Companys estimates differ from actual payments or assessments, income tax expense is adjusted. Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2006, the Company had deferred tax assets of $103.3 million, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of $47.1 million. The valuation allowance of $19.9 million as of December 31, 2006, reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain investments and the net operating loss carry forwards of certain United States and non United States subsidiaries. The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Stock based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values. Stock based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period). The valuation provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified. Estimated compensation expense for grants that were outstanding, as of the effective date, will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, determined in the pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units, the Company issues common stock. The Company elected the modified prospective method of transition, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 45 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"), which amends SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pension," SFAS No. 88, "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," and other related literature. SFAS 158 results from the initial phase of a comprehensive project to improve an employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in comprehensive income. In addition, SFAS 158 requires employers to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet. SFAS 158 does not change the accounting for a multi employer plan. SFAS 158 provides different effective dates for the recognition and related disclosure provisions, and for the required change to a fiscal year end measurement date. In December 2006, the Company applied the requirements to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans and made the required disclosures. As of December 31, 2006, the adoption of SFAS 158 increased the Companys long term liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes by $4.9 million and $4.3 million, respectively. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end balance sheet shall be effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. The Company does not expect the change in fiscal year end measurement date to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements"("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides guidance on the considerations of the effect of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. In December 2006, the Company adopted SAB 108. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," ("SFAS 154") a replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and FASB Statement No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements." SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition by recording a cumulative effect adjustment within net income in the period of change. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 154. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R. This Statement supersedes APB 25 and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R eliminates the alternative to use APB 25s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued. Under APB 25, issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost. SFAS 123R requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). Although SFAS 123R was to be effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that began after June 15, 46 2005, on April 15, 2005, the SEC extended the date for compliance. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107"), which provides the Staffs view regarding interactions between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. SAB 107 covers key topics related to the implementation of SFAS 123R which include the valuation models, expected volatility, expected option term, income tax effects of SFAS 123R, classification of stock based compensation cost, capitalization of compensation cost, and disclosure requirements. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R versus continuing to account for stock based compensation under APB 25, the Companys income before provision for income taxes and net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 were reduced by $19.3 million and $13.8 million, respectively. In addition, basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 21, 2006 were reduced by $0.24 and $0.22, respectively. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS 123R requires that they be recorded as financing cash flows rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. For the year ended December 31, 2006, $5.2 million of excess tax benefits have been classified as a financing cash inflow. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." This Statement amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted this standard. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that adopting SFAS 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing guidance for the recognition, de recognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits be disclosed. The application of FIN 48 may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets. The Company will be required to adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. If there are changes in the net assets of the Company as a result of the application of FIN 48, the cumulative effects, if any, will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption of FIN 48 and has not yet determined the effect on its earnings and financial position. 47 In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets" ("SFAS 156"), which amends SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" ("SFAS 140"). SFAS 156 requires recognition of a servicing asset or liability at fair value each time an obligation is undertaken to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract. SFAS 156 also provides guidance on subsequent measurement methods for each class of servicing assets and liabilities and specifies financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements. SFAS 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 156 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments" ("SFAS 155"), which amends SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), and SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." ("SFAS 140"). SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk, opportunity and costs. Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, option based products and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $295.2 million and $198.0 million, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, option based products, and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the Companys exposure through its use of derivatives. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis. There were no interest rate swaps in effect as of December 31, 2006. As part of its overall risk management program, the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 54 basis point increase in interest rates (approximately 10 percent of the Companys weighted average interest rate) affecting the Companys financial instruments, including debt obligations 48 and related derivatives and investments, would have an immaterial effect on the Companys annual interest expense. Currency Risk The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese yen and the Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net United States dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option based products consist of purchased put options and, at times, written (sold) call options to create collars. Option based products are agreements that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels. As part of its risk management process, the Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, with a 95 percent confidence level and a 14 day holding period, to estimate this potential loss. The Companys calculated VAR at December 31, 2006 and 2005, with a maturity of up to one year, is $2.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. This amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Companys calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future. 49  Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default, and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counter party diversification, monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2006 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2006, all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "AA" or better by national rating agencies. The Company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of December 31, 2006. The Company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in April 2000. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses. In 2006, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net. Investment Risk Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies. These investments are classified in "Investments in unconsolidated affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately $20.2 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $1.4 million on these investments in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)," net of tax. Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary. 50
