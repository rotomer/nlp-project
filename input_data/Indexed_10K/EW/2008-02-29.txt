Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2007. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2007. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview Edwards Lifesciences is a global provider of products and technologies that are designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences focuses on providing products and technologies to 24 address specific cardiovascular conditions including heart valve disease; critical care technologies; and peripheral vascular disease. The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease are categorized into five main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; Vascular; and Other Distributed Products. Edwards Lifesciences Heart Valve Therapy portfolio is comprised of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products. A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the Critical Care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring equipment used to measure a patients cardiovascular function and in disposable pressure transducers, and also provides central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery. The Companys Cardiac Surgery Systems portfolio comprises a diverse line of products for use during cardiac surgery including cannula, EMBOL X technologies, transmyocardial revascularization ("TMR") products, and other disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures (in March 2007 the Company sold the distribution rights to its TMR products). In December 2007, the Company acquired the CardioVations line of products used in minimally invasive heart valve surgery. Edwards Lifesciences Vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, artificial implantable grafts, and stents ("LifeStent" products) used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease (the Company sold the LifeStent product line in January 2008). Lastly, Other Distributed Products consist primarily of intra aortic balloon pumps sold through the Companys distribution network in Japan (the Company terminated the distribution agreement effective December 31, 2007). The healthcare marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors. The Company competes with many companies, ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than Edwards Lifesciences with access to significant financial resources. Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the Company competes. Global demand for healthcare is increasing as the population ages. There is mounting pressure to contain healthcare costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. The cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic and currently undergoing significant change due to cost of care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs. Management expects these trends to continue. 25 Results of Operations Net Sales Trends The following is a summary of United States and international net sales (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 United States $ 486.6 $ 477.9 $ 455.9 $ 8.7 $ 22.0 1.8 % 4.8 % Europe 309.1 264.6 241.3 44.5 23.3 16.8 % 9.7 % Japan 171.4 168.8 186.4 2.6 (17.6 ) 1.5 % (9.4 )% Intercontinental 124.0 125.7 114.3 (1.7 ) 11.4 (1.4 )% 10.0 % International 604.5 559.1 542.0 45.4 17.1 8.1 % 3.2 % Total net sales $ 1,091.1 $ 1,037.0 $ 997.9 $ 54.1 $ 39.1 5.2 % 3.9 % The $8.7 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2007 was due primarily to: Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $15.5 million, driven primarily by sales of the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, advanced hemodynamic monitoring equipment, and pressure monitoring products; Vascular products, which increased net sales by $7.0 million, driven primarily by an increase in LifeStent product sales; partially offset by: decreased sales of TMR products of $10.8 million (the Company sold its distribution rights in March 2007); The $45.4 million increase in international net sales in 2007 was due primarily to: Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $19.6 million, driven primarily by sales of the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, pressure monitoring products, and hemofiltration products; Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $17.7 million, driven primarily by increases in sales of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna valve, Magna with ThermaFix valve, and Magna Ease valve; Vascular products, which increased net sales by $5.1 million, driven primarily by an increase in LifeStent product sales; Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $30.2 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar; partially offset by: a decrease of $32.1 million related to (1) the discontinuation of the Brazil based perfusion product line in December 2006, (2) the Companys exit from the mechanical valve market during 2007, and 26 (3) a reduction of distributed sales in Japan of intra aortic balloon pumps (the Company terminated the distribution agreement effective December 31, 2007). The $22.0 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2006 was due primarily to increased sales of Critical Care, Heart Valve Therapy and Vascular products. The net sales increase in Critical Care products of $10.7 million was primarily driven by sales of the new FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system and advanced hemodynamic products. The net sales increase in Heart Valve Therapy products of $8.2 million was primarily driven by the premium Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna and Magna with ThermaFix valves. The net sales increase in Vascular products of $4.7 million was primarily driven by sales of LifeStent products. The $17.1 million increase in international net sales in 2006 was due primarily to increases in Critical Care, Heart Valve Therapy and Vascular products. The net sales increase in Critical Care products of $15.9 million was primarily driven by sales of the new FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system throughout international locations and advanced hemodynamic products in Europe. The net sales increase in Heart Valve Therapy products of $14.9 million was primarily driven by increased valve sales in Japan and Europe. The net sales increase in Vascular products of $4.4 million was primarily driven by sales of LifeStent products in Europe. These increases were partially offset by the sale in 2005 of the Companys perfusion products in Japan, which decreased net sales by $13.8 million, and to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Brazilian real against the United States dollar), which decreased net sales by $5.2 million. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Companys hedging activities.

Net Sales by Product Line The following is a summary of net sales by product line (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 Heart Valve Therapy $ 515.0 $ 490.8 $ 469.3 $ 24.2 $ 21.5 4.9 % 4.6 % Critical Care 397.8 349.8 324.1 48.0 25.7 13.7 % 7.9 % Cardiac Surgery Systems 60.9 91.0 104.6 (30.1 ) (13.6 ) (33.1 )% (13.0 )% Vascular 90.0 75.9 66.1 14.1 9.8 18.6 % 14.8 % Other Distributed Products 27.4 29.5 33.8 (2.1 ) (4.3 ) (7.1 )% (12.7 )% Total net sales $ 1,091.1 $ 1,037.0 $ 997.9 $ 54.1 $ 39.1 5.2 % 3.9 % Heart Valve Therapy The $24.2 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2007 was due primarily to: pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $11.6 million, primarily as a result of the premium Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna aortic valve and Magna with ThermaFix valves; 27 heart valve repair products, which increased net sales by $3.6 million, driven primarily by the continuing adoption of the Companys disease specific products including the Edwards MC3; a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $14.9 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar; partially offset by: a decrease in net sales of $8.1 million due to the Companys exit from the mechanical valve market commencing in the first quarter of 2007 and the continuing decline of mitral valve sales. The $21.5 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2006 was due primarily to: pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $20.8 million, primarily as a result of the premium Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna and Magna with ThermaFix valves; and heart valve repair products, which increased net sales by $9.0 million, primarily as a result of the continuing adoption of the Companys newest products including the Edwards MC3, IMR ETlogix and GeoForm rings. These increases in 2006 were partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $2.6 million (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar) and the continuing decline in net sales of porcine and mechanical valves. The Company expects that its PERIMOUNT Magna and Magna with ThermaFix valves will continue to be strong contributors to 2008 sales. In January 2007, the Company launched two new products in the United States. The new PERIMOUNT Theon aortic valve offers clinicians the durability and hemodynamics of the Companys PERIMOUNT technology with the addition of the ThermaFix tissue treatment, and the new Myxo ETlogix annuloplasty ring is the first mitral repair product specifically designed to address myxomatous disease. In May 2007, the Company launched its next generation aortic valve, the Magna Ease, in Europe and is expecting to introduce this product into the United States in 2009. The Companys new PERIMOUNT Magna mitral valve is gaining physician acceptance in Europe, and the Company looks forward to gaining FDA approval as rapidly as possible in the United States (the Company is currently addressing additional questions from the FDA on the pre clinical bench testing and anticipates that it will obtain FDA approval by mid 2008). In Japan, the Company received regulatory approval for a new PERIMOUNT mitral valve and began sales during the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, the Company anticipates regulatory approval and reimbursement for its Magna aortic valve in Japan in the first quarter of 2008. The Company plans to launch the Carpentier Edwards Physio II ring in the third quarter of 2008, which is the next generation repair product for the degenerative segment of mitral repair. Physio II represents the first innovation in this area in over a decade. Critical Care The $48.0 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2007 was due primarily to: FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $16.8 million; core Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $14.3 million, driven primarily by market share gains in pressure monitoring products, advanced hemodynamic monitoring equipment, and PreSep, the Companys central venous oximetry catheter for early detection of sepsis; 28 hemofiltration products, which increased net sales by $4.0 million; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $10.4 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The $25.7 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2006 was due primarily to: FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $11.2 million; core Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $8.6 million, driven primarily by market share gains in advanced technology catheter products and pressure monitoring products; and hemofiltration products, which increased net sales by $6.9 million. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased net sales by $2.2 million in 2006 (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). The Company expects worldwide FloTrac system sales to be a significant contributor to Critical Care sales growth in 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company introduced enhanced FloTrac monitoring screens to the United States market, which allow clinicians to more easily trend patient status. In 2008, the Company plans to introduce additional product enhancements that will enable FloTrac to address a wider range of patients. Cardiac Surgery Systems The $30.1 million decrease in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2007 was due primarily to the impact of the sale of the Companys Brazil based perfusion product line in December 2006, which resulted in a net sales decrease of $21.5 million. In addition, the Companys exit from the TMR product line in March 2007 contributed to a decrease in net sales of $10.8 million. These decreases were partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $1.5 million. The $13.6 million decrease in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems in 2006 was due primarily to the sale of the Companys perfusion product line in Japan in 2005, which decreased net sales by $13.8 million, and a decline in TMR sales. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of specialty cannula products, driven primarily by market share gains. In December 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets of CardioVations. The CardioVations product line includes the PORT ACCESS products, such as the proprietary EndoCPB and EndoDirect systems for minimally invasive heart valve surgery, which comprise soft tissue retractors, venous and arterial cannulae, vent and coronary sinus catheters, and reusable instruments for performing port access cardiac valve procedures. CardioVations clinical specialists provide training and tools to the cardiac surgeons who are performing these minimally invasive procedures. Vascular The $14.1 million increase in net sales of Vascular products in 2007 was due primarily to increased sales of LifeStent products. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact on net sales of $3.0 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar. The $9.8 million increase in net sales of Vascular products in 2006 was due primarily to sales of LifeStent products. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company made enhancements to its new FlexStar 29 delivery system and upgraded the United States field inventory to the new system. In addition, in the third quarter of 2006, the Company introduced a new line of longer length stents, FlexStar XL, in the United States. In January 2008, the Company completed the sale of the LifeStent product line. This divestiture is part of the Companys ongoing strategy to focus resources on its core heart valve and critical care businesses. The Company has agreed to provide transition services, including manufacturing, to the buyer until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer, and will continue to pursue pre market approval for a superficial femoral artery indication. Other Distributed Products The $2.1 million decrease in net sales of Other Distributed Products in 2007 was due primarily to the divestiture in 2006 of a non strategic pharmaceutical product and a reduction of distributed sales in Japan of intra aortic balloon pumps. In order to focus on its proprietary products, the Company terminated its distribution of a third partys line of intra aortic balloon pumps in Japan in December 2007. The $4.3 million decrease in net sales of Other Distributed Products in 2006 was due primarily to exiting the Japan pacemaker business in the first quarter of 2005 and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $1.2 million (primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar). In May 2006, the Company divested a non strategic pharmaceutical product which represented approximately $2 million in annual sales. Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 65.3 % 64.0 % 62.5 % 1.3 pts. 1.5 pts. The 1.3 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2007 was driven by: a 1.5 percentage point increase in international gross profit as a percentage of net sales, which was due to a more profitable product mix, primarily related to higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products and FloTrac systems, combined with the discontinuation of lower margin perfusion products; and a 0.5 percentage point increase in United States gross profit as a percentage of net sales, which was due to a more profitable product mix, resulting primarily from higher sales of FloTrac systems, and the Companys exit from the lower margin TMR product line. These increases were partially offset by increased investments in quality systems, certain manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency resulting from the expiration of currency hedging contracts. The 1.5 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2006 was driven by the Companys international operations. The increase in international gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by (1) a 0.8 percentage point increase from the discontinuation of lower margin products and (2) a 0.6 percentage point increase from the favorable impact of foreign currency, including the expiration of currency hedging contracts. These increases were partially offset by a 0.5 percentage point decrease from unfavorable product mix in the international Vascular and Critical Care product lines. The United States 30 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 0.5 percentage points due to favorable product mix, primarily in the Heart Valve Therapy product line. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 SG&A expenses $ 418.0 $ 376.0 $ 348.7 $ 42.0 $ 27.3 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 38.3 % 36.3 % 34.9 % 2.0 pts. 1.4 pts. The $42.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and the 2.0 percentage point increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2007 was due primarily to (1) investments for the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve launch in Europe, (2) higher sales related spending in the Heart Valve Therapy, Critical Care and Vascular product lines, primarily in the United States, and (3) the impact of foreign currency (primarily the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar) in the amount of $12.4 million. The $27.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 was due primarily to stock based compensation expense of $12.9 million, as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), and higher sales and marketing expenses primarily related to the Companys Heart Valve Therapy product line and new products in the United States. The 1.4 percentage point increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2006 was due primarily to stock based compensation expense. Research and Development Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 Research and development expenses $ 122.3 $ 114.2 $ 99.0 $ 8.1 $ 15.2 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 11.2 % 11.0 % 9.9 % 0.2 pts. 1.1 pts. The increase in research and development expenses in 2007 was due primarily to additional investments in the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve and Critical Care development programs. The increase in research and development expenses in 2006 was due primarily to additional investments in the Companys transcatheter valve programs. In addition, research and development expenses increased by $3.7 million as a result of adopting SFAS 123R. In the Companys transcatheter aortic valve replacement program (formerly Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc.s ("PVT") percutaneous aortic valve program), the Company received conditional Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") approval from the FDA in March 2007 to initiate its PARTNER trial, a pivotal clinical trial of the Companys Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve technology. The PARTNER trial, which has two study arms, began enrollment during the second quarter of 2007 and will evaluate the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve valve in patients who are considered at high risk for conventional open heart valve surgery. In the first study arm ("Cohort A"), patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either high risk surgery or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. Cohort A will have 31 690 patients and is a non inferiority analysis. In the second study arm ("Cohort B"), patients who are deemed non operable will be randomized 1:1 to medical management or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. Cohort B will have 350 patients and is a superiority analysis. The Company anticipates it will complete enrollment in Cohort B by the end of 2008 and complete enrollment in Cohort A by the end of the third quarter 2009. All of the SAPIEN valves in the PARTNER trial have been delivered transfemorally using the RetroFlex delivery system. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company received approval to begin selling the SAPIEN valve in Europe with the RetroFlex I and RetroFlex II transfemoral delivery systems. Initially, the Company plans to sell the SAPIEN valve in Europe with the RetroFlex I, and will phase in the RetroFlex II during the first half of 2008. The RetroFlex II, first used in Canada in the first quarter of 2007, further enhances the ease of use benefits of RetroFlex I by adding a customized atraumatic tip to enable clinicians to more easily navigate across the native stenotic aortic valve. The Company has received regulatory approval to add RetroFlex II to the United States PARTNER trial. Both the Ascendra transapical and transfemoral delivery systems are available for sale in Europe. The Company completed enrollment in its United States feasibility study of the Ascendra transapical delivery system in April 2007. In January 2008, the Company obtained FDA approval to add Ascendra to the PARTNER trial. Having Ascendra in the trial will give cardiac surgeons an opportunity to partner in this technology and it will allow the Company to address more patients. In the Companys transcatheter mitral valve repair program, the Company had two systems: the Edwards MONARC mitral repair system (formerly ev3, Inc.s ("ev3") percutaneous mitral valve repair program), a coronary sinus technology, and the Edwards MOBIUS leaflet repair system. In connection with the Edwards MONARC system, the Company completed enrollment of its 60 patient EVOLUTION I feasibility study during the first quarter of 2007 and initiated the EVOLUTION II follow on trial in Europe and Canada during the second quarter of 2007. The Company is continuing to collect and analyze additional clinical data, and has postponed enrollment of EVOLUTION II until 2008, when that analysis is expected to be completed. For the Edwards MOBIUS system, the Companys feasibility work was completed in Europe and Canada in the first quarter of 2007. After completing the clinical feasibility studies, the Company determined that it would take considerable additional resources and time to affect durable and long lasting repair results with the Edwards MOBIUS device. Therefore, the Company discontinued work on the MOBIUS technology and redirected resources into other advanced technology development programs. Although the termination of this program will reduce the Companys future revenue potential, the termination does not materially impact the Companys financial condition since future funding of the Companys operations was not dependent upon the success of this program. Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses The information in "Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses," related to regulatory milestones, describes the Companys expectations with respect to the applicable programs at the time of the respective acquisitions and does not reflect subsequent activities or expectations. Refer to "Research and Development Expenses," above, for the current status of these programs, the Companys expectations, and the financial impact from changes in the Companys expectations. 32 2005 In September 2005, the Company recorded a $1.2 million pre tax charge for in process research and development related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property. The acquired assets are expected to be utilized in the Companys existing mitral valve repair research and development efforts. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. 2004 On September 29, 2004, the Company acquired all technology and intellectual property associated with ev3s percutaneous mitral valve repair program for total consideration of $15.0 million. The acquired assets were expected to be utilized in the Companys existing percutaneous mitral valve repair research and development efforts. At the time of the purchase, ev3 had been unsuccessful in developing a viable prototype and had discontinued the program. Completion of successful design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies were required prior to selling any product. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $12.3 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 30%. The valuation assumed approximately $39.0 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, the Company estimated completion in 2009 of the mitral valve repair program utilizing the intellectual property acquired from ev3, and commencement in 2010 of net cash inflows. The remaining fair market value of the assets purchased consisted primarily of patents unrelated to ev3s core mitral valve repair technology, which are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 19 years. On January 27, 2004, the Company acquired PVT, a development stage company, for $125.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus up to an additional $30.0 million upon the achievement of key milestones through 2007 (see "Special Charges (Gains), net"). Included in PVTs technology was a catheter based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves, comprised of a proprietary, percutaneously delivered balloon expandable stent technology integrated with a tissue heart valve. Unlike conventional open heart valve replacement surgery, this less invasive procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and could potentially be a breakthrough for patients seeking an alternative to open heart surgery. At the time of acquisition, the PVT aortic heart valve was being used in compassionate cases in Europe, and these clinical results had generated valuable feasibility data. It had been demonstrated that a heart valve could be successfully deployed and anchored using a catheter based system. Also at that time, PVT was expecting to obtain a CE mark in Europe by the end of 2005 and to file for a Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") in the United States. Upon approval of the HDE, PVT would be able to offer this device to as many as 4,000 patients per year. Broader commercialization in the United States was expected to begin with the submission of an IDE by the end of the second quarter of 2004 followed by the commencement of a pivotal trial in 2005 and possible pre market approval by the end of 2007. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time included those 33 related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $81.0 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development in 2004. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 25%. The valuation assumed approximately $20.9 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, net cash inflows were forecasted to commence in 2007. The remaining fair market value of the net assets acquired consisted primarily of patents of $72.4 million that are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 11 years, and a deferred tax liability related to the patents of $28.1 million. Special Charges (Gains), net Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Realignment expenses, net $ 13.9 $ 9.4 $ 3.9 Pension settlement and adjustment 11.2 Settlements and litigation (gains) losses, net (20.2 ) 2.9 Gain on sale of assets, net (1.8 ) (13.7 ) (14.1 ) PVT milestone 10.0 Discontinued products 6.8 1.4 Restructure 3F agreements 2.0 22.8 Litigation reserve 1.2 Investment impairments 16.3 Charitable fund contribution 15.0 Total special charges (gains), net $ 23.3 $ (4.5 ) $ 48.2 Realignment Expenses, net In December 2007, the Company recorded realignment expenses of $13.9 million primarily related to (1) severance expenses associated with the sale of the Companys LifeStent product line and a global reduction in workforce, primarily in the United States, Europe and Japan (impacting approximately 180 employees), and (2) the termination of the Companys intra aortic balloon pump distribution agreement in Japan. As of December 31, 2007, remaining payments of approximately $13.0 million are expected to be paid in 2008. 34  In December 2006, the Company recorded a $7.3 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global reduction in workforce of approximately 70 employees, primarily in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2007, all payments related to the realignment were substantially complete. In January 2006, the Company recorded realignment expenses of $2.1 million primarily related to severance expenses associated with the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in Japan (impacting 92 employees). The realignment expenses are net of a $0.4 million reversal of previously accrued severance costs related to the sale of the Japan perfusion product line to Terumo as discussed in the "Gain on Sale of Assets, net" section. As of December 31, 2007, all payments related to the realignment were substantially complete. In December 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $3.9 million related to severance resulting from a resource realignment. The charge was related primarily to the severance costs associated with reducing the Companys workforce by 52 employees, primarily in Puerto Rico, Europe and the United States. As of December 31, 2007, all payments related to the realignment were complete. Pension Settlement and Adjustment In December 2007, the Puerto Rico pension plan was settled and benefits were distributed to the participants through a combination of lump sum payments and the purchase of annuities. The Company recorded a charge of $7.1 million in December 2007 related to the settlement. In December 2007, the Company applied the provisions of SFAS 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"), to a defined benefit pension plan in Switzerland, which had previously been accounted for as a defined contribution plan. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $4.1 million in December 2007. The Company concluded that the impact on the prior years and current year for the increase in the pension obligation was not material to the consolidated financial statements. Settlements and Litigation (Gains) Losses, net In January 2006, the Company recorded a patent dispute settlement gain of $20.2 million, which consisted of a net payment of $23.8 million received from Medtronic, Inc., offset by patent enforcement costs. In September 2005, the Company recorded a gain of $2.5 million related to the resolution of intellectual property litigation. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a $5.4 million charge related to two royalty dispute settlements. Gain on Sale of Assets, net In December 2007, the Company recorded a gain of $1.8 million for the sale of real estate development rights in Irvine, California, that had no book value at the time of sale. In December 2006, the Company sold its assets associated with the Companys angiogenesis research and development project to Sangamo BioSciences, Inc. ("Sangamo") in exchange for 1.0 million shares of Sangamo common stock. The Company recorded a $6.1 million gain, which represents the fair value of the common stock on the closing date, less the book value of the assets sold. 35 In May 2006, the Company sold a non strategic pharmaceutical product to Bioniche Teoranta for $9.0 million. The sale of the related assets resulted in a $4.5 million gain, consisting of cash proceeds of $9.0 million, offset by $4.5 million related primarily to the net book value of intangible assets and inventory that were sold. During the second quarter of 2006, the Company agreed to sell most of its assets related to its remaining international cardiopulmonary perfusion product line. The Company determined that the carrying values of the underlying assets exceeded their fair values. Consequently, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), in June 2006, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.6 million, which represented the excess of the carrying values of the assets over their fair values, and included direct incremental costs to transact the sale of $1.5 million. The sale was completed in December 2006 and no additional gain or loss was recorded. In November 2005, the Company sold its vascular graft business to Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $14.0 million in cash. Under the agreement, the Company will continue to market and sell its existing Lifespan products. The sale of the business resulted in a $13.1 million net gain, consisting of cash proceeds of $14.0 million offset by the $0.9 million net book value of inventory and fixed assets that were sold. In January 2005, the Company announced that it was realigning its business in Japan as part of the Companys continued efforts to focus on its core cardiovascular businesses. The Company (1) restructured its operations, (2) exited its pacemaker distribution business and (3) sold its perfusion product line in Japan to Terumo Corporation for cash consideration of $14.9 million, of which $9.2 million was received in January 2005 and $5.7 million was received in March 2006 as an earn out payment. In 2005, the Company recorded a $1.0 million net gain, consisting of a gain on the sale of the Companys Japan perfusion product line of $7.7 million, offset by (1) a $5.7 million charge related to the realignment of its operations, primarily related to severance costs due to headcount reductions, and (2) a $1.0 million charge related to settlement, curtailment and special termination benefits impacting its defined benefit pension plan. In 2006, the Company recorded a gain of $5.7 million related to the receipt of the earn out payment. PVT Milestone In December 2006, the Company recorded a $10.0 million charge for the contractual transcatheter clinical milestone obligation to PVTs former shareholders. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company achieved and paid the $10.0 million to PVTs former shareholders. As all contractual milestone obligation dates have expired, the Company does not expect to make any additional payments to PVTs former shareholders. Discontinued Products During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company discontinued the Optiwave 980 Cardiac Laser Ablation System. The Company recorded a $6.8 million charge resulting primarily from the disposal of fixed assets and the write off intangible assets. In addition, the Company recorded a $2.0 million charge to cost of goods sold related to the disposal of inventory. In December 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $1.4 million resulting from the payment of an early termination fee to discontinue certain firm non cancelable product purchase commitments related to a discontinued product line in Europe. 36 Restructure 3F Agreements In June 2005, the Company recorded a special charge of $22.8 million related to the restructuring of development and supply agreements between 3F Therapeutics, Inc. and PVT that were established prior to the Companys acquisition of PVT in early 2004. Under the terms of the new agreements, the Company obtained the rights to self manufacture all components of its transcatheter heart valves and certain pre approved technology licenses. In 2006, the Company paid and recorded an additional $2.0 million for the final payment to 3F Therapeutics for completing certain contractual obligations. Investment Impairments In September 2005, the Company recorded an $8.9 million charge related to the other than temporary impairment of its investment in Sangamo. The investment was written down to $3.7 million, which represented the quoted market price of Sangamos common stock at September 30, 2005. The Company considered numerous facts, including those described below, to conclude that any impairment of the Sangamo investment was temporary in nature as of the end of each of the quarters in 2003 and 2004, and the first two quarters of 2005: Sangamos key internally established development milestones were progressing and or remained on track at each quarter end throughout 2003 and 2004, and the first two quarters of 2005. There were no changes in technology that could impair Sangamos earnings potential of the investment and the technological progress supported a positive outlook. The Company believed that the number and scope of Sangamos programs and the range of its third party collaborations and the continued success in the Companys Sangamo related programs would significantly drive the value of Sangamo. Moreover, the clinical momentum was building at the end of 2004 with the anticipation of three to four Phase I human trials, the likely completion of one or more Phase I trials with positive data and the planned announcements at major medical meetings. Management of the Company believed that declines in Sangamos stock price were a result of certain external events and general investor sentiment of the biotechnology sector, and not Sangamo specific activities. In addition, the Company recognized that, historically, reports of significant positive clinical outcomes had frequently resulted in a significant increase in the stock price of a biotechnology company over a relatively short time period. Management believed this would be the case for Sangamo. Throughout all periods in which the Company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary, Sangamo maintained cash and liquid investment reserves sufficient to continue to fund the ongoing development efforts for the technology for periods well in excess of one year. Throughout all periods in which the Company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary, the Company had the financial ability and intent to retain this investment indefinitely. Sangamos technology was considered important to the development of certain of the Companys next generation products, and required a long term horizon for ongoing development of new technology. Sangamo is a multi technology (human therapeutics, drug discovery and plant agriculture) biotechnology company and has the ability to attract many different investors. In addition, the diversity of technology applications served to dilute the risk related to any one application failure. 37 The Company expected the market price of Sangamos stock to increase not only as a result of announcements of positive clinical trial results, but also other operational events. During the second half of 2005, Sangamo announced five significant key developments regarding collaborative agreements, additional funding and breakthrough technology. The Company expected that this concentration of positive developments could have generated a considerable increase in the stock price, better recognizing the underlying value of Sangamo. Based upon (1) the significant developments in the third quarter of 2005 which, individually and in the aggregate, failed to have a material impact on the quoted market price of Sangamos stock, (2) the continuing duration and severity of the impairment, and (3) Sangamos declining cash position, the Company concluded in September 2005 that the impairment on its investment in Sangamo was other than temporary and, therefore, recognized an $8.9 million charge in earnings. In 2005, the Company recorded additional charges totaling $7.4 million related to other than temporary impairment of technology investments in five other unconsolidated affiliates. Of the total additional charge, $1.9 million related to declines in the stock prices of two available for sale investments. The remaining charges were due to increased potential risk of certain private investees uncertain future liquidity. Charitable Fund Contribution In September 2005, the Company made a contribution of $15.0 million to the Edwards Lifesciences Fund, a donor advised fund intended to provide philanthropic support to cardiovascular disease charitable causes. The contribution was an irrevocable contribution to a third party and was recorded as a charge at time of payment. Interest Expense The $1.4 million decrease in interest expense for 2007 resulted primarily from a lower average debt balance as compared to the prior year. The $1.8 million decrease in interest expense for 2006 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates, which resulted from the expiration of the Companys fixed interest rate swap contracts in the third quarter of 2005, combined with a greater portion of debt in low interest rate countries. Interest Income The $0.1 million decrease in interest income for 2007 resulted from slightly lower average interest rates. The $5.2 million increase in interest income for 2006 resulted from higher interest rates and a higher cash and cash equivalent balance. 38 Other (Income) Expense, net The following is a summary of other (income) expense, net (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Gain on sale of product line $ (2.3 ) $ $ Foreign exchange gain, net (2.0 ) (0.3 ) (2.1 ) Gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates (1.3 ) Accounts receivable securitization costs 3.0 2.6 1.7 Investment valuation reserve 0.7 Other 0.4 0.2 $ (1.9 ) $ 2.7 $ (0.2 ) In March 2007, the Company sold the United States distribution rights and inventory associated with the TMR laser product line to Novadaq Technologies, Inc. for up front consideration of $5.4 million, which consisted of $2.4 million in cash and a $3.0 million senior secured promissory note, which was collected in full during the third quarter of 2007. This resulted in a gain of $0.3 million. In connection with the transaction, the Company was entitled to earn out payments based on Novadaqs TMR sales during 2007. During 2007, the Company earned $2.0 million, recorded in "Other (Income) Expense, net." Foreign exchange gains relate to the foreign currency fluctuation on the Companys global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances. The increase in foreign exchange gains in 2007 was due primarily to the strengthening of various Asia currencies. The gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2007 primarily represents the Companys net share of gains and losses in technology investments accounted for under the equity method. The increases in securitization costs in 2007 and 2006 were due to increases in average interest rates and higher average securitized balances. The investment valuation reserve of $0.7 million represents the estimated impairment in the value of the Companys short term investments. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below for further information. 39 Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were impacted as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Income tax expense at U.S. federal statutory rate $ 52.4 $ 60.3 $ 40.9 Foreign income tax at different rates (21.4 ) (19.8 ) (16.4 ) Deemed dividends, net of foreign tax credit 3.2 4.2 3.6 Tax credits, federal and state (2.8 ) (2.0 ) (2.0 ) State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 3.1 4.7 0.2 Valuation allowance for loss on investments (0.6 ) (7.0 ) (6.2 ) Nondeductible PVT milestone payment 3.5 Taxes on repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 15.0 Nondeductible stock based compensation 1.9 2.2 Reserve for uncertain tax positions for prior years 1.2 (5.6 ) (0.2 ) Other (0.2 ) 1.3 2.5 Income tax provision $ 36.8 $ 41.8 $ 37.4 Valuation Allowance for Loss on Investments The Company recorded other than temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are subject to the Company realizing sufficient capital gains with which to offset these capital losses. Due to the uncertainty of the Company realizing future capital gains, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated. As of December 31, 2007, deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately $2.1 million had accumulated related to investments. During 2007, the Company recognized in the fourth quarter capital gains on the sale of real estate development rights and a capital loss on the sale of investments. As a result, the Company has reversed valuation allowances of $0.6 million due to adequate capital gains to offset capital losses. During 2006, the Company recognized capital gains in the second quarter from the sale of a non strategic business and in the fourth quarter, a gain from the sale of the angiogenesis business and a capital loss on the sale of shares in World Heart Corporation. The capital gains have allowed or will allow the Company to utilize the same amounts of the accumulated losses related to impaired investments. As a result, valuation allowances of $3.7 million and $3.3 million were reversed in the second and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. During 2005, valuation allowances were made in each quarter against investment impairments recognized. The valuation allowance amounts were $0.2 million in the first quarter, $2.0 million in the second quarter, $3.8 million in the third quarter and $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, for a total for the year of $7.1 million. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company realized a capital gain related to the sale of its vascular graft business and anticipated a capital gain in January 2006 related to the settlement 40 of the Medtronic litigation (see "Legal Proceedings"). As a result, valuation allowances were reversed, reducing the income tax provision during the fourth quarter of 2005 by $13.3 million. Nondeductible PVT Milestone Payment During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $10.0 million charge for achieving a contractual transcatheter clinical milestone obligation with PVT. The $10.0 million payment is not deductible for income tax purposes. Taxes on Repatriation Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law in October 2004 and allowed companies to repatriate cash during 2004 and 2005 into the United States at a special, temporary effective tax rate of 5.25%. On September 13, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a plan for reinvestment and repatriation of specific foreign earnings under the Act. The Company repatriated $263.1 million in cash in 2005. The Company accrued $15.0 million for federal, state and foreign taxes attributable to the distribution from its foreign affiliates in 2005. Nondeductible Stock based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R and recognized expense in 2006 and 2007 related to stock based compensation. Some of those costs are not deductible in the United States or in foreign countries. Reserve for Uncertain Tax Positions for Prior Years During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company settled several of its ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, the Companys tax provision benefited from $5.6 million of favorable audit settlements for prior years. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at anytime. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes is the expected outcome, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The tax reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. The Company believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest, if any, have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations of uncertain tax positions. During the third quarter of 2007, the Internal Revenue Service initiated an audit of the 2005 and 2006 tax years. This audit is expected to close in late 2008. No significant unexpected adjustments have been proposed to date. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities, accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash from operations. The Company 41 believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, maturing debt obligations and other financial commitments. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all. The Company has a Five Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement"), which matures on September 29, 2011. The Credit Agreement provides up to an aggregate of $500.0 million in one to six month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.40%, which includes a facility fee subject to adjustment for leverage ratio changes, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company pays a facility fee regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.075%. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement have been classified as long term obligations, as these borrowings will continue to be refinanced pursuant to the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2007, borrowings of $61.7 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2007. In addition to the Credit Agreement, as of December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding $150.0 million of convertible senior debentures, issued at par, bearing an interest rate of 3.875% per annum due May 15, 2033 (the "Notes"). Interest is payable semi annually in May and November. Issuance costs of approximately $4.4 million are being amortized to interest expense over 5 years. The Notes are convertible into 18.29 shares of the Companys common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (conversion price of $54.66 per share), subject to adjustment. Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, on May 15, 2008, 2013, and 2018. The Company must pay cash for all Notes so purchased on May 15, 2008. For any Notes purchased by the Company on May 15, 2013 or 2018, the Company may, at its option, choose to pay the purchase price in cash, in shares of the Companys common stock, or any combination thereof. The Notes have been classified as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 given their potential redemption for cash by the holders on May 15, 2008. The Company has two securitization programs whereby certain subsidiaries in the United States and Japan sell, without recourse, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of accounts receivable. The significant benefits of the securitizations are lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity. The Company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to borrowings under the current LIBOR based credit facility. Additionally, the Company believes that in diversifying its funding sources, the Companys funding availability in the capital markets is strengthened. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had sold a total of $96.7 million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of $87.6 million. The securitization program in the United States will expire on September 16, 2008 and the securitization program in Japan will expire on December 3, 2008. In December 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets of the CardioVations Division of Ethicon, Inc., including products and technology used in minimally invasive heart valve surgery. The total purchase price was $28.1 million, which consisted of $26.9 million in cash, $0.2 million in assumed liabilities, and $1.0 million in transaction costs. 42 In December 2007, the Company received notification that the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund in which the Company had invested $50.1 million as of December 31, 2007, was being closed to new subscriptions or redemptions, resulting in the Companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash. The fair value of the Companys investment in this fund as of December 31, 2007 was estimated to be $49.4 million based on the net asset value of the fund, and has been classified as "Short Term Investments" on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2007, the Company recognized a loss of $0.7 million, included in "Other (Income) Expense, net," related to the estimated realizable value of this fund. The Company expects to receive cash redemptions for its remaining investment during 2008. In January 2008, the Company completed the sale of certain assets related to the Edwards LifeStent peripheral vascular product line. This divestiture is part of the Companys ongoing strategy to focus resources on its core heart valve and critical care businesses. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received an initial cash payment of $74.0 million at closing, and will receive up to an additional $65.0 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones, including the receipt of United States regulatory approval of the Companys LifeStent products for a superficial femoral artery indication and the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing. The Company has agreed to provide transition services until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer. In May 2006, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to 4.0 million shares of the Companys common stock through December 31, 2008. In September 2007, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to an additional $250.0 million of the Companys common stock. Stock repurchased under these programs will be used primarily to offset obligations under the Companys employee stock option programs. During 2007, the Company repurchased 2.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $130.9 million and has remaining authority under the September 2007 program to purchase $250.0 million of the Companys common stock. On January 23, 2006, the Company settled certain patent litigation against Medtronic. As a result, in January 2006, the Company recorded a gain of $20.2 million, which consisted of the $37.5 million cash offset by the settlement paid to Endogad, capitalized patent enforcement costs of $2.9 million and current legal fees. See "Item 3" for additional information. In 2006, the Company notified its employees of its intent to terminate its defined benefit pension plan in Puerto Rico (the "Plan") and in December 2007 the Plan was settled and benefits were distributed to the participants through a combination of lump sum payments and the purchase of annuities. The final distribution was $30.9 million, which included an $8.2 million payment to the Plan to ensure that the value of the Plans assets was sufficient to cover all benefit liabilities. The Company recorded a pre tax settlement charge of $7.1 million in December 2007 related to the settlement. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $210.2 million for 2007 decreased $20.6 million from 2006 primarily due to $23.8 million received in 2006 for the patent litigation settlement with Medtronic and higher tax payments in 2007, partially offset by net cash inflows resulting from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2007. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $230.8 million for 2006 increased $94.0 million from 2005 primarily due to (1) higher earnings, adjusted for non operating and non cash items, (2) $23.8 million 43 received in 2006 from the patent litigation settlement with Medtronic, (3) a cash payment of $23.0 million made in 2005 related to the restructuring of development and supply agreements and (4) a charitable contribution payment of $15.0 million made in 2005. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted versus 2005 by net cash used to fund working capital requirements, which consisted primarily of net cash outflows for accrued liabilities and taxes payable, partially offset by net cash inflows from accounts receivables due to lower days sales outstanding. Net cash used by investing activities of $144.5 million in 2007 consisted primarily of (1) capital expenditures of $57.0 million, (2) a $55.0 million reclassification from cash to short term investments associated with the closing of the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, as explained above, (3) a $27.2 million payment associated with the acquisition of certain assets of CardioVations and (4) a $9.8 million milestone payment associated with the PVT acquisition in 2004. Net cash used by investing activities of $35.7 million in 2006 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $57.4 million, partially offset by proceeds of (1) $9.0 million from the sale of a non strategic pharmaceutical product, (2) $7.5 million from the sale of assets related to the Companys remaining international cardiopulmonary perfusion product line and (3) $5.7 million related to an earn out payment from the 2005 sale of the Companys perfusion product line in Japan. Net cash used in financing activities of $108.1 million in 2007 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $130.9 million and net payments on long term debt of $27.9 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $38.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $193.6 million in 2006 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $145.9 million and net payments on long term debt of $85.9 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $33.5 million. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2007 were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt $ 211.7 $ 150.0 $ $ 61.7 $ Interest on long term debt 5.0 3.1 1.4 0.5 Operating leases 46.5 13.7 18.3 9.2 5.3 Pension obligation(a) 3.3 3.3 Contractual development and capital commitment obligations(b)(c) 10.7 4.0 4.2 2.0 0.5 Total contractual cash obligations(d) $ 277.2 $ 174.1 $ 23.9 $ 73.4 $ 5.8 (a)The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to the Companys various pension plans. Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. The total accrued benefit liability for the Companys pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2007 was $16.5 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual 44 obligations table. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (b)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones. (c)Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees. These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made. (d)As of December 31, 2007, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $39.1 million. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Companys accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Companys transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions. Management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies. Management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, income taxes, any impairments of assets, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products 45 where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return, and no unusual provisions or conditions. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted. The Companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on third party data, as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations. The Companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Companys United States distributors and represents the difference between the Companys sales price to the distributor (at the Companys distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer. This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor. The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest distributors. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. The Company continually monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated. The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPO") and customers based upon target sales levels. These volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO. The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on our customers contracted rebate programs and our historical experience of rebates paid. The Company continually monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated. Product returns are minimal because returns are not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. An allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $7.5 million and $6.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 46 Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. Inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), or damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply). The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $14.9 million and $13.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Patent Costs The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable. Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. To the extent the Company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement, costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes the two step goodwill impairment test as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, the Company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value. Additionally, in accordance with SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. 47 Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term, strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development. Certain of these investments are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)." Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investees outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded at the amount of the Companys investment and adjusted each period for the Companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid. As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value. When the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss: the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investees performance against product development milestones; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Income Taxes Income taxes are determined under guidelines prescribed by SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based on technical merit if challenged 48 by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Stock based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values. Stock based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period). The valuation provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified. Estimated compensation expense for grants that were outstanding, as of the effective date, are being recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, determined in the pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units, the Company issues common stock. The Company elected the modified prospective method of transition, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing guidance for the recognition, de recognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits be disclosed. The application of FIN 48 may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. Differences between the amounts reported as a result of adoption have been accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the January 1, 2007 "Retained Earnings" balance. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a $1.7 million decrease in tax reserves and increase in the January 1, 2007 "Retained Earnings" balance. As of the adoption date of January 1, 2007, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $24.6 million which is included in "Other Long Term Liabilities." This liability can be reduced by $3.4 million of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. The net amount of $21.2 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. 49 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions): Unrecognized tax benefits, January 1, 2007 $ 24.6 Increase prior period tax positions 12.1 Decrease prior period tax positions (7.9 ) Current year tax positions 8.6 Settlements (0.9 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (0.1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, December 31, 2007 $ 36.4 As of December 31, 2007, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $36.4 million. This liability can be reduced by $8.0 million of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. The net amount of $28.4 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company had accrued $1.1 million (net of $0.2 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions and as of December 31, 2007, the Company had accrued $3.1 million (net of $1.1 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The unrecognized tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions. During the third quarter of 2007, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") initiated an audit of the 2005 and 2006 tax years. This audit is expected to close in late 2008. No significant unexpected adjustments have been proposed to date. As a result of the IRS and other audits, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months due to either settlement of audits or expiration of statutes of limitations. Quantification of those potential changes cannot be estimated at this time. At December 31, 2007, the Company has concluded all United States federal income tax matters for years through 2004. All material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2002. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value 50 measurements. Certain provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 which amends SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," SFAS No. 88, "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," and other related literature. SFAS 158 results from the initial phase of a comprehensive project to improve an employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in comprehensive income. In addition, SFAS 158 requires employers to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet. SFAS 158 does not change the accounting for a multi employer plan. SFAS 158 provides different effective dates for the recognition and related disclosure provisions, and for the required change to a fiscal year end measurement date. In December 2006, the Company applied the requirements to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans and made the required disclosures. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end balance sheet shall be effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 allows reporting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments at fair value and incorporates an amendment to SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which is applicable to all entities with trading securities or securities that are considered to be available for sale. The provisions within SFAS 159 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with early adoption permitted as long as the provisions of SFAS 157 are also early adopted. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") in EITF Issue No. 07 3, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities" ("EITF 07 3"). EITF 07 3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized until the related service is performed or the goods are delivered. EITF 07 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 07 3 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business 51 combination. Among other requirements, SFAS 141R expands the definition of a business combination, requires acquisitions to be accounted for at fair value, and requires transaction costs and restructuring charges to be expensed. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R will only impact the Company if it is involved in a business combination. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF in EITF Issue No. 07 1, "Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements" ("EITF 07 1"). EITF 07 1 defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties. EITF 07 1 also establishes the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint operating activities and payments between participants, as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures related to these arrangements. EITF 07 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Retrospective application to all prior periods presented is required for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 07 1 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk, opportunity and costs. Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, option based products and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $336.2 million and $295.2 million, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, option based products, and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the Companys exposure through its use of derivatives. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis. There were no interest rate swaps in effect as of December 31, 2007. 52 As part of its overall risk management program, the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 39 basis point increase in interest rates (approximately 10% of the Companys weighted average interest rate) affecting the Companys financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments, would have an immaterial effect on the Companys annual interest expense. Currency Risk The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese yen and the Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net United States dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option based products consist of purchased put options and, at times, written (sold) call options to create collars. Option based products are agreements that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels. As part of its risk management process, the Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, with a 95 percent confidence level and a 14 day holding period, to estimate this potential loss. The Companys calculated VAR at December 31, 2007 and 2006 with a maturity of up to one year, was $5.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. This amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Companys calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future. 53 Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default, and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counter party diversification, monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2007 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2007, all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "AA" or better by national rating agencies. The Company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of December 31, 2007. The Company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in April 2000. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses. In 2007, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net. Investment Risk Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies. These investments are classified in "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2007, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately $34.3 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $7.5 million on these investments in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)," net of tax. Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary. The Company has recorded in "Short term Investments" cash held in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund, which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in December 2007, resulting in the Companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash. The fair value of the Companys investment in this fund as of December 31, 2007 was estimated to be $49.4 million based on the net asset value of the fund. As of December 31, 2007, the Company recognized a loss of $0.7 million, included in "Other (Income) Expense, net," related to the estimated realizable value of this fund. The Company expects to receive cash redemptions for its remaining investment during 2008. 54
