Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2008. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2008. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is a global leader in products and technologies designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. The Company is focused specifically on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients. The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease are categorized into four main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; and Vascular. Previously, Edwards Lifesciences provided Other Distributed Products, which included sales of intra aortic balloon pumps and other products sold primarily through the Companys distribution network in Japan. Edwards terminated its distribution agreement for these products at the end of December 2007. Edwards Lifesciences Heart Valve Therapy portfolio is comprised of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products. A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the Critical Care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring equipment used to measure a patients cardiovascular function and in disposable pressure transducers, and also provides central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery. The Companys Cardiac Surgery Systems portfolio comprises a diverse line of products for use during 21 Table of Contents cardiac surgery including cannula, EMBOL X technologies, and other disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Cardiac Surgery Systems also included transmyocardial revascularization ("TMR") products until March 2007 when the Company sold the distribution rights to its TMR products. In December 2007, the Company acquired the CardioVations line of products used in MIS. Edwards Lifesciences Vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, artificial implantable grafts, and stents ("LifeStent" products) for which approval is being sought for use in treatment of peripheral vascular disease. The Company sold the LifeStent product line in January 2008, but will continue to manufacture these products for the buyer until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer. The healthcare marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors. The Company competes with many companies, ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than Edwards Lifesciences with access to significant financial resources. Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the Company competes. Global demand for healthcare is increasing as the population ages. There is mounting pressure to contain healthcare costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. The cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic, and technology, cost of care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change. Results of Operations Net Sales Trends The following is a summary of United States and international net sales (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2008 2007 United States $ 543.6 $ 486.6 $ 477.9 $ 57.0 $ 8.7 11.7 % 1.8 % Europe 380.3 309.1 264.6 71.2 44.5 23.0 % 16.8 % Japan 176.5 171.4 168.8 5.1 2.6 3.0 % 1.5 % Rest of World 137.3 124.0 125.7 13.3 (1.7 ) 10.7 % (1.4 )% International 694.1 604.5 559.1 89.6 45.4 14.8 % 8.1 % Total net sales $ 1,237.7 $ 1,091.1 $ 1,037.0 $ 146.6 $ 54.1 13.4 % 5.2 % The $57.0 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2008 was due primarily to: CardioVations MIS products, which increased net sales by $23.7 million. The Company purchased the CardioVations MIS product line in December 2007; LifeStent products (all of which are recorded in the United States in 2008), which increased net sales by $13.7 million. LifeStent sales include end customer sales recorded prior to the divestiture of LifeStent in mid January 2008, and sales after the divestiture resulting from the on going manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement, which will continue until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $13.8 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, hemofiltration products, and pressure monitoring products; and Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $7.3 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna with ThermaFix valve and the Magna mitral valve, partially offset by a reduction in net sales due to the voluntary retrieval of the Companys Myxo and IMR ETlogix repair products pending FDA clearance of its 510(k) submissions. 22 Table of Contents The $89.6 million increase in international net sales in 2008 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $85.1 million, driven primarily by the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve, and the launch of the Magna aortic valve in Japan; and Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $40.2 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, pressure monitoring products, and hemofiltration products; partially offset by: a decrease of $41.3 million related to the discontinuation of distributed sales in Japan of intra aortic balloon pumps and the divestiture of the LifeStent product line. The benefit of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations included above increased net sales by $37.3 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The $8.7 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2007 was due primarily to: Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $15.5 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, advanced hemodynamic monitoring equipment, and pressure monitoring products; and Vascular products, which increased net sales by $7.0 million, driven primarily by LifeStent products; partially offset by: decreased sales of TMR products of $10.8 million (the Company sold its distribution rights in March 2007). The $45.4 million increase in international net sales in 2007 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $33.8 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna valve, Magna with ThermaFix valve, and Magna Ease valve; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $32.6 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, pressure monitoring products, and hemofiltration products; and Vascular products, which increased net sales by $9.6 million, driven primarily by LifeStent products; partially offset by: a decrease of $32.1 million related to (1) the discontinuation of the Brazil based perfusion product line in December 2006, (2) the Companys exit from the mechanical valve market during 2007, and (3) a reduction of distributed sales in Japan of intra aortic balloon pumps (the Company terminated the distribution agreement effective December 31, 2007). The benefit of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations included above increased net sales by $30.2 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Companys hedging activities.

The $24.2 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2007 was due primarily to: pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $23.9 million, primarily as a result of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna aortic valve and Magna with ThermaFix valves; and heart valve repair products, which increased net sales by $6.4 million, driven primarily by the continuing adoption of the Companys disease specific products, including the Edwards MC3; partially offset by: a decrease in net sales of $8.1 million due to the Companys exit from the mechanical valve market commencing in the first quarter of 2007 and the continuing decline of mitral valve sales. The Company expects that its SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve will continue to be a strong contributor to 2009 sales, and anticipates introducing new products across the aortic, mitral, and valve repair categories. The Company launched the Magna Ease valve in Europe in May 2007, and is expecting to introduce this product into the United States in the third quarter of 2009, pending regulatory approval. The Company expects to launch an enhancement to its Magna Mitral valve, called the Magna Mitral Ease, in the second half of 2009 in the United States and Europe. The Magna Mitral Ease is uniquely designed to improve its ease of implantation, which is beneficial for both traditional and minimally invasive surgical procedures. The Companys PERIMOUNT Magna mitral valve is gaining physician acceptance in Europe, and the Company launched this product into the United States during September 2008. In Japan, the Company received regulatory and reimbursement approval for its Magna aortic valve and introduced this product in Japan during June 2008. The Company expects this product to continue to accelerate its growth rate in Japan. The Company had its first implants of the Carpentier Edwards Physio II ring during the third quarter of 2008 and expects to launch the product in the United States and Europe during the first quarter of 2009. Physio II is the next generation repair product for the degenerative segment of mitral repair. 24 Table of Contents Critical Care The $54.0 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2008 was due primarily to: core Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $26.3 million, driven primarily by market share gains in pressure monitoring products and PreSep, the Companys central venous oximetry catheter for early detection of sepsis; FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $19.8 million; and hemofiltration products, which increased net sales by $7.9 million. The $48.0 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2007 was due primarily to: core Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $22.8 million, driven primarily by market share gains in pressure monitoring products, advanced hemodynamic monitoring equipment, and PreSep, the Companys central venous oximetry catheter for early detection of sepsis; FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $17.5 million; and hemofiltration products, which increased net sales by $7.7 million. The Company expects worldwide FloTrac system sales to continue to be a significant contributor to Critical Care sales growth in 2009, and that it will continue to expand the market for minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring. During the second quarter of 2008, the Company introduced an enhancement to the FloTrac system that provides additional information in the operating room. At the end of 2008, the Company purchased intellectual property that is expected to be incorporated into a substantial upgrade for FloTrac, which is planned for launch in the third quarter of 2009. In addition, the Company anticipates launching a new hardware platform in the third quarter of 2009 that will result in a simpler, more intuitive informational display. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with DexCom, Inc. ("DexCom") to develop products for continuously monitoring blood glucose levels in patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions. In 2009, the Company expects to complete clinical studies to support regulatory approval and anticipates introducing a first generation product in Europe by year end. Cardiac Surgery Systems The $28.3 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2008 was due primarily to the acquisition of the CardioVations MIS product line in December 2007, which increased net sales by $30.1 million. This increase was partially offset by the discontinuation of the Brazil based perfusion product line, which resulted in a net sales decrease of $4.4 million. The $30.1 million decrease in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2007 was due primarily to the impact of the sale of the Companys Brazil based perfusion product line in December 2006, which resulted in a net sales decrease of $21.5 million. In addition, the Companys exit from the TMR product line in March 2007 contributed to a decrease in net sales of $10.8 million. Vascular The $0.7 million decrease in net sales of Vascular products in 2008 was due primarily to LifeStent products. In January 2008, the Company completed the sale of the LifeStent product line. The Company agreed to provide transition services, including manufacturing, to the buyer until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer, and to pursue pre market approval for a superficial femoral artery indication. LifeStent sales include end customer sales recorded prior to the divestiture of LifeStent in mid January and sales after the divestiture resulting from the on going manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement. 25 Table of Contents The $14.1 million increase in net sales of Vascular products in 2007 was due primarily to LifeStent products. Other Distributed Products The $27.4 million and $2.1 million decreases in net sales of Other Distributed Products in 2008 and 2007, respectively, were due primarily to the termination at the end of 2007 of distributed sales in Japan of intra aortic balloon pumps. Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 66.1% 65.3% 64.0% 0.8 pts. 1.3 pts. The 0.8 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2008 was driven by: a 2.1 percentage point increase in international gross profit as a percentage of net sales, due to a more profitable product mix, primarily related to higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products and FloTrac systems, combined with the discontinuation of lower margin perfusion products and intra aortic balloon pumps; partially offset by: a 0.5 percentage point decrease in United States gross profit as a percentage of net sales, due primarily to sales of LifeStent products under the on going manufacturing requirements of the LifeStent sale agreement, partially offset by a more profitable product mix, primarily higher sales of FloTrac systems; and the impact from the expiration of foreign currency hedging contracts. The 1.3 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2007 was driven by: a 1.5 percentage point increase in international gross profit as a percentage of net sales, which was due to a more profitable product mix, primarily related to higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products and FloTrac systems, combined with the discontinuation of lower margin perfusion products; and a 0.5 percentage point increase in United States gross profit as a percentage of net sales, which was due to a more profitable product mix, resulting primarily from higher sales of FloTrac systems and the Companys exit from the lower margin TMR product line. These increases were partially offset by increased investments in quality systems, certain manufacturing costs, and the unfavorable impact from the expiration of foreign currency hedging contracts. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 SG&A expenses $ 480.6 $ 418.0 $ 376.0 $ 62.6 $ 42.0 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 38.8 % 38.3 % 36.3 % 0.5 pts. 2.0 pts. The $62.6 million increase in SG&A expenses and the 0.5 percentage point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2008 were due primarily to (1) higher sales related spending, including investments for the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve launch in Europe, (2) the impact of foreign currency (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar) in 26 Table of Contents the amount of $16.7 million, and (3) higher compensation expense related to the Companys strong sales performance. The $42.0 million increase in SG&A expenses and the 2.0 percentage point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2007 were due primarily to (1) investments for the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve launch in Europe, (2) higher sales related spending in the Heart Valve Therapy, Critical Care, and Vascular product lines, primarily in the United States, and (3) the impact of foreign currency (primarily the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar) in the amount of $12.4 million. Research and Development Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Research and development expenses $ 139.2 $ 122.3 $ 114.2 $ 16.9 $ 8.1 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 11.2 % 11.2 % 11.0 % 0.2 pts. The increase in research and development expenses in 2008 was due primarily to additional investments in transcatheter and surgical heart valve programs. The increase in research and development expenses in 2007 was due primarily to additional investments in transcatheter heart valve and Critical Care development programs. The following are the developments related to the Companys transcatheter aortic valve replacement program (formerly Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc.s ("PVT") percutaneous aortic valve program): the Company received conditional Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") approval from the FDA in March 2007 to initiate its PARTNER trial, a pivotal clinical trial of the Companys Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve technology. The PARTNER trial, which has two study arms, began enrollment during the second quarter of 2007 and will evaluate the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in patients who are considered at high risk for conventional open heart valve surgery. In the first study arm ("Cohort A"), patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either high risk surgery or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. Cohort A will have 690 patients and is a non inferiority analysis. In the second study arm ("Cohort B"), patients who are deemed non operable will be randomized 1:1 to medical management or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. Cohort B will have 350 patients and is a superiority analysis. The Company anticipates it will complete enrollment in Cohort A in August 2009 and in Cohort B by the end of the first quarter of 2009; the Company completed enrollment in its United States feasibility study of the Ascendra transapical delivery system in April 2007. The Company obtained FDA approval to add Ascendra to the PARTNER trial in January 2008, and during the second quarter of 2008 the first patients received the SAPIEN valve using Ascendra. The Company believes that having Ascendra in the trial will give cardiac surgeons an opportunity to partner in this technology and it will allow the Company to address a larger patient population. The Ascendra transapical delivery system is available for sale in Europe; the Company received regulatory approval to add the RetroFlex II delivery system to the PARTNER trial and began selling RetroFlex II in Europe during the second quarter of 2008. The RetroFlex II enhances the ease of use benefits of RetroFlex I by adding a customized atraumatic tip to enable clinicians to more easily navigate across the native stenotic aortic valve. The Company recently received CE Mark approval for European commercial sales of its new RetroFlex III delivery system, which further simplifies the delivery of its SAPIEN valve; 27 Table of Contents the Company began its United States feasibility trial of the SAPIEN valve in the pulmonic position in April 2008. The goal of this clinical study is to enable physicians to offer a minimally invasive alternative to patients with a failing pulmonic valve, using the Companys transcatheter valve platform and RetroFlex delivery system. The Company expects to complete enrollment in April 2009 and then transition to a larger humanitarian device exemption trial; and first in man cases using the Companys next generation transcatheter heart valve, the Edwards SAPIEN XT, were performed during the first quarter of 2008. In December 2008, the first three implants were performed in the CE Mark trial. The Company believes that this next generation valves features will help reduce its delivery profile without compromising strength, making it available to an even wider group of patients. The Company expects to complete enrollment in its CE Mark trial in the second quarter of 2009, and expects to gain an IDE approval to begin a clinical trial in the United States before the end of 2009. The following are the developments related to the Companys transcatheter mitral valve program (formerly ev3, Inc.s ("ev3") percutaneous mitral valve repair program): in October 2008, the Company announced the continuation of the EVOLUTION II clinical trial of the Edwards MONARC system which is deployed into the coronary sinus. This trial will study patients with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure in Europe and Canada. The Company is currently screening patients for this trial, and expects the first implants to be performed in early 2009. Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses The information in "Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses," related to regulatory milestones, describes the Companys expectations with respect to the applicable programs at the time of the respective acquisitions and does not reflect subsequent activities or expectations. Refer to "Research and Development Expenses" above for the current status of these programs, the Companys expectations, and the financial impact from changes in the Companys expectations. On September 29, 2004, the Company acquired all technology and intellectual property associated with ev3s percutaneous mitral valve repair program for total consideration of $15.0 million. The acquired assets were expected to be utilized in the Companys existing percutaneous mitral valve repair research and development efforts. At the time of the purchase, ev3 had been unsuccessful in developing a viable prototype and had discontinued the program. Completion of successful design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies, and human clinical studies were required prior to selling any product. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $12.3 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 30%. The valuation assumed approximately $39.0 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, the Company estimated completion in 2009 of the mitral valve repair program utilizing the intellectual property acquired from ev3, and commencement in 2010 of net cash inflows. The remaining fair market value of the assets purchased consisted primarily of patents unrelated to ev3s core mitral valve repair technology, which are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 19 years. On January 27, 2004, the Company acquired PVT, a development stage company, for $125.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus up to an additional $30.0 million upon the achievement of key milestones through 2007 (see "Special Charges (Gains), net"). Included in PVTs technology was a catheter based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves, comprised of a proprietary, percutaneously delivered balloon expandable stent technology integrated with a tissue heart valve. Unlike conventional open heart valve 28 Table of Contents replacement surgery, this less invasive procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and could potentially be a breakthrough for patients seeking an alternative to open heart surgery. At the time of acquisition, the PVT aortic heart valve was being used in compassionate cases in Europe, and these clinical results had generated valuable feasibility data. It had been demonstrated that a heart valve could be successfully deployed and anchored using a catheter based system. Also at that time, PVT was expecting to obtain a CE mark in Europe by the end of 2005 and to file for a Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") in the United States. Upon approval of the HDE, PVT would be able to offer this device to as many as 4,000 patients per year. Broader commercialization in the United States was expected to begin with the submission of an IDE by the end of the second quarter of 2004 followed by the commencement of a pivotal trial in 2005 and possible pre market approval by the end of 2007. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time included those related to the design, development, and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $81.0 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development in 2004. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 25%. The valuation assumed approximately $20.9 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, net cash inflows were forecasted to commence in 2007. The remaining fair market value of the net assets acquired consisted primarily of patents of $72.4 million that are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 11 years, and a deferred tax liability related to the patents of $28.1 million. Special Charges (Gains), net Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Acquisition of in process technology and intellectual property $ 19.5 $ $ DexCom collaboration agreement 13.4 Adjustment to capitalized patent enforcement costs 8.2 Settlements and litigation losses (gains), net 0.6 (20.2 ) Realignment expenses, net (1.7 ) 13.9 9.4 Gain on sale of assets, net (14.9 ) (1.8 ) (13.7 ) Pension settlement and adjustment 11.2 PVT milestone 10.0 Discontinued products 6.8 Other 3.2 Total special charges (gains), net $ 25.1 $ 23.3 $ (4.5 ) Acquisition of In Process Technology and Intellectual Property In October 2008, the Company recorded a $5.0 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property. The acquired technology is being developed for use in restoring heart geometry and function and offers a reshaping solution for patients who suffer from debilitating functional mitral regurgitation. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. In November 2008, the Company recorded a $13.2 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property, primarily related to a product which is currently under development, and certain tangible assets, including proto types and equipment used in the development of the product. The 29 Table of Contents acquired technology is being developed for use in hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company must pay an additional &euro;3.0 million (US$4.1 million) milestone payment should the Company achieve net sales of the product in Europe of &euro;6.4 million (US$8.8 million) in any four consecutive quarters in the first five years following market launch in Europe. In December 2008, the Company recorded a $1.3 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property related to a device for the reduction or elimination of mitral regurgitation and the control of left ventricular dilation. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. DexCom Collaboration Agreement In November 2008, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with DexCom to develop products for continuously monitoring blood glucose levels in patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions. The agreement provides Edwards Lifesciences with an exclusive license to all of DexComs applicable intellectual property. The Company recorded a charge of $13.4 million related to the upfront licensing and collaboration fee. Edwards Lifesciences will also pay up to $24 million over the next three years in product development costs and regulatory approval milestones. In addition, DexCom will receive either a profit sharing payment of ten percent or a royalty of up to six percent of commercial sales. Edwards Lifesciences will be responsible for global sales and marketing, which is expected to begin in 2010, and DexCom will be responsible for initial manufacturing. Adjustment to Capitalized Patent Enforcement Costs In December 2008, the Company recorded an $8.2 million charge due primarily to the reversal of capitalized patent enforcement costs for a litigation claim related to patents in a product area where the Company does not currently compete and where the related patent enforcement costs should therefore be expensed as incurred. The Company recorded the correction of this error in the fourth quarter of 2008. Approximately $5.7 million of the charge related to 2007 and 2006, and $2.5 million related to the first, second, and third quarters of 2008. The Company concluded that the adjustments were not material to any of the prior years financial statements, and the impact of the correcting adjustment is not material to the full year 2008 financial statements. Settlements and Litigation Losses (Gains), net In December 2008, the Company recorded a $1.5 million insurance settlement gain related to a fire that occurred in the third quarter of 2007 which damaged certain inventory held at a third party warehouse in Brazil. In March 2008, the Company recorded a $2.1 million charge for the settlement of litigation related to its divested United States perfusion services business. Under the terms of the divestiture, this was the Companys last outstanding case. In January 2006, the Company recorded a patent dispute settlement gain of $20.2 million, which consisted of a net payment of $23.8 million received from Medtronic, Inc., offset by patent enforcement costs. Realignment Expenses, net In March 2008, the Company recorded a $1.3 million charge for executive severance associated with the Companys business realignment. As of December 31, 2008, remaining payments of $0.7 million for the executive severance charge are expected to be paid through the end of 2009. 30  Table of Contents In December 2007, the Company recorded realignment expenses of $13.9 million primarily related to (1) severance expenses associated with the sale of the Companys LifeStent product line and a global reduction in workforce, primarily in the United States, Europe, and Japan (impacting approximately 180 employees), and (2) the termination of the Companys intra aortic balloon pump distribution agreement in Japan. In 2008, the Company reversed $3.0 million of the December 2007 accrued severance related to the sale of the LifeStent product line and global reduction in workforce. As of December 31, 2008, remaining payments of approximately $2.6 million are expected to be paid in 2009. In December 2006, the Company recorded a $7.3 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global reduction in workforce of approximately 70 employees, primarily in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2008, all payments related to the realignment were complete. In January 2006, the Company recorded realignment expenses of $2.1 million primarily related to severance expenses associated with the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in Japan (impacting 92 employees). The realignment expenses are net of a $0.4 million reversal of previously accrued severance costs related to the sale of the Japan perfusion product line to Terumo Corporation as discussed in the "Gain on Sale of Assets, net" section. As of December 31, 2008, all payments related to the realignment were complete. Gain on Sale of Assets, net In January 2008, the Company completed the sale of certain assets related to the LifeStent product line. This divestiture was part of the Companys ongoing strategy to focus resources on its core Heart Valve and Critical Care product lines. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received an initial cash payment of $74.0 million at closing, and is entitled to receive up to an additional $65.0 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones, including the receipt of United States regulatory approval of the LifeStent products for a superficial femoral artery indication and the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing. The Company agreed to provide transition services until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer. Because of the Companys continued involvement in the operations of LifeStent after its sale, the Company did not report the loss on disposition or the results of LifeStents operations as discontinued operations. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded in January 2008 a pre tax loss of $8.1 million consisting of the cash proceeds of $74.0 million, offset by a $34.6 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line, $36.9 million related to the net book value of inventory, fixed assets, and intangible assets that were sold, $6.9 million of deferred revenue related to the transition services the Company has agreed to provide, and $3.7 million of transaction and other costs related to the sale. In December 2008, the Company recorded a gain of $23.0 million for the receipt of a LifeStent milestone payment in connection with the transfer of its pre market approval ("PMA") to the buyer. In February 2009, the Company received an additional $27.0 million milestone payment upon receipt of the United States regulatory approval, and the remaining $15.0 million milestone payment will be recorded upon the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing to the buyer. In December 2007, the Company recorded a gain of $1.8 million for the sale of real estate development rights in Irvine, California, that had no book value at the time of sale. In December 2006, the Company sold its assets associated with the Companys angiogenesis research and development project to Sangamo BioSciences, Inc. ("Sangamo") in exchange for 1.0 million shares of Sangamo common stock. The Company recorded a $6.1 million gain, which represents the fair value of the common stock on the closing date, less the book value of the assets sold. In May 2006, the Company sold a non strategic pharmaceutical product to Bioniche Teoranta for $9.0 million. The sale of the related assets resulted in a $4.5 million gain, consisting of cash proceeds of $9.0 million, offset by $4.5 million related primarily to the net book value of intangible assets and inventory that were sold. 31 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2006, the Company agreed to sell most of its assets related to its remaining international cardiopulmonary perfusion product line. The Company determined that the carrying values of the underlying assets exceeded their fair values. Consequently, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), in June 2006, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.6 million, which represented the excess of the carrying values of the assets over their fair values, and included direct incremental costs to transact the sale of $1.5 million. The sale was completed in December 2006 and no additional gain or loss was recorded. The Company sold its perfusion product line in Japan to Terumo Corporation, and in 2006 recorded a $5.7 million gain related to the receipt of an earn out payment. Pension Settlement and Adjustment In December 2007, the Puerto Rico pension plan was settled and benefits were distributed to the participants through a combination of lump sum payments and the purchase of annuities. The Company recorded a charge of $7.1 million in December 2007 related to the settlement. In December 2007, the Company applied the provisions of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS 87") and SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"), to a defined benefit pension plan in Switzerland, which had previously been accounted for as a defined contribution plan. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $4.1 million in December 2007 to correct this error. The Company concluded that the impact for the increase in the pension obligation was not material to the 2007 or prior years consolidated financial statements. PVT Milestone In December 2006, the Company recorded a $10.0 million charge for the contractual transcatheter clinical milestone obligation to PVTs former shareholders and subsequently paid $9.8 million in 2007. As all contractual milestone obligation dates have expired, the Company does not expect to make any additional payments to PVTs former shareholders. Discontinued Products During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company discontinued the Optiwave 980 Cardiac Laser Ablation System. The Company recorded a $6.8 million charge resulting primarily from the disposal of fixed assets and the write off of intangible assets. In addition, the Company recorded a $2.0 million charge to cost of goods sold related to the disposal of inventory. Interest Expense Interest expense was $7.2 million, $9.1 million, and $10.5 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The $1.9 million decrease in interest expense for 2008 resulted primarily from lower interest rates as compared to the prior year. The $1.4 million decrease in interest expense for 2007 resulted primarily from a lower average debt balance as compared to the prior year. Interest Income Interest income was $6.1 million, $7.7 million, and $7.8 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The $1.6 million decrease in interest income for 2008 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates. The $0.1 million decrease in interest income for 2007 resulted from slightly lower average interest rates. 32 Table of Contents Other Expense (Income), net The following is a summary of other expense (income), net (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Foreign exchange losses (gains), net $ 7.2 $ (2.0 ) $ (0.3 ) Investment impairment and realized losses 3.0 0.7 Accounts receivable securitization costs 1.6 3.0 2.6 Gain on sale of property development rights (0.5 ) Gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates (2.0 ) (1.3 ) Gain on sale of product line (2.3 ) Other (1.6 ) 0.4 $ 7.7 $ (1.9 ) $ 2.7 The foreign exchange losses (gains) relate to the foreign currency fluctuations on the Companys global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances. Foreign exchange resulted in a net loss in 2008 compared to a net gain in 2007 due primarily to fluctuations in the Euro and the Japanese yen. The investment impairment and realized losses represents the realized losses and estimated impairment in the value of the Companys investment in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for further information. The decrease in securitization costs in 2008 was due primarily to the Companys termination of its securitization program in the United States in August 2008. The increase in securitization costs in 2007 was due to increases in average interest rates and higher average securitized balances. The gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily represents realized gains on the Companys available for sale investments and the Companys share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method. In March 2007, the Company sold the United States distribution rights and inventory associated with the TMR laser product line to Novadaq Technologies, Inc. ("Novadaq") for up front consideration of $5.4 million, which consisted of $2.4 million in cash and a $3.0 million senior secured promissory note, which was collected in full during the third quarter of 2007. This resulted in a gain of $0.3 million. In connection with the transaction, the Company was entitled to earn out payments based on Novadaqs TMR sales during 2007. During 2007, the Company earned $2.0 million, recorded in "Other Expense (Income), net." 33 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were impacted as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense at U.S. federal statutory rate $ 57.5 $ 52.4 $ 60.3 Foreign income tax at different rates (26.4 ) (21.4 ) (19.8 ) Nondeductible goodwill 12.2 Reserve for uncertain tax positions for prior years (6.2 ) 1.2 (5.6 ) Tax credits, federal and state (3.5 ) (2.8 ) (2.0 ) State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 2.0 3.1 4.7 Nondeductible stock based compensation 0.9 1.9 2.2 Deemed dividends, net of foreign tax credit 0.6 3.2 4.2 Valuation allowance for loss on investments (0.6 ) (7.0 ) Nondeductible PVT milestone payment 3.5 Other (1.6 ) (0.2 ) 1.3 Income tax provision $ 35.5 $ 36.8 $ 41.8 Nondeductible Goodwill During 2008, the Company completed the sale of certain assets related to the LifeStent product line. A $34.6 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line was recorded. This amount is not deductible for tax purposes. Reserve for Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $35.9 million and $36.4 million, respectively. These liabilities could be reduced by $2.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments. The net amounts of $33.6 million and $28.4 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2008 2007 Unrecognized tax benefits, January 1 $ 36.4 $ 24.6 Increase prior period tax positions 12.3 12.1 Decrease prior period tax positions (19.9 ) (7.9 ) Current year tax positions 18.0 8.6 Settlements (10.9 ) (0.9 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (0.1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, December 31 $ 35.9 $ 36.4 The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had accrued $1.9 million (net of $0.5 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2007, the Company had accrued $3.1 million (net of $1.1 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions. 34 Table of Contents The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions. During the third quarter of 2007, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") initiated an audit of the 2005 and 2006 tax years. This audit closed during 2008. During 2009, the IRS is expected to initiate an audit of the 2007 tax year. As a result of the on going audits, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months due to either settlement of audits or expiration of statutes of limitations. Quantification of those potential changes cannot be estimated at this time. At December 31, 2008, the Company has concluded all United States federal income tax matters for years through 2006. All material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2003. Nondeductible Stock based Compensation Some of the costs recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R") are not deductible in the United States or in foreign countries. Valuation Allowance for Loss on Investments The Company recorded other than temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are subject to the Company realizing sufficient capital gains in the appropriate period with which to offset these expected capital losses. Due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain of these impaired investments, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated. As of December 31, 2008, deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately $4.3 million had accumulated related to investments. Of the total valuation allowance of $4.3 million, $2.2 million was recorded during 2008 as a component of "Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income." The remaining $2.1 million had previously been recorded as of December 31, 2007 through charges to profit and loss. During 2007, the Company recognized capital gains on the sale of real estate development rights and a capital loss on the sale of investments. As a result, the Company reversed valuation allowances of $0.6 million due to adequate capital gains to offset capital losses. During 2006, the Company recognized capital gains from the sale of a non strategic business and the sale of the angiogenesis business, and a capital loss on the sale of shares in World Heart Corporation. The capital gains have allowed or will allow the Company to utilize the same amounts of the accumulated losses related to impaired investments. As a result, valuation allowances of $7.0 million were reversed in 2006. Nondeductible PVT Milestone Payment During 2006, the Company recorded a $10.0 million charge for achieving a contractual transcatheter clinical milestone obligation with PVT. The $10.0 million payment is not deductible for income tax purposes. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments. The Company is not currently experiencing any limitation on access to its credit facility as a result of the recent turmoil in global financial markets. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all. As a result of the recent turmoil in the global financial market, as well as other factors, the unfunded portion of the Companys pension obligation has increased significantly from the prior year (See Note 11 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). As a result, the Company expects that the net periodic benefit cost in future periods will increase. In 2009, the Company is expecting to make a contribution of approximately $3.3 million. The Company has a Five Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement"), which matures on September 29, 2011. The Credit Agreement provides up to an aggregate of $500.0 million in one to six month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.40%, which includes a facility fee subject to adjustment for leverage ratio changes, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company pays a facility fee regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.075%. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement have been classified as long term obligations, as these borrowings are expected to be refinanced pursuant to the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2008, borrowings of $175.5 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2008. On May 9, 2008, the Company called for redemption its $150.0 million of convertible senior debentures (the "Notes"). Prior to the redemption date of June 9, 2008, holders of approximately $147.7 million principal amount of the Notes converted their debentures into approximately 2.7 million shares of Edwards common stock at a conversion price of $54.66 per share. The remaining outstanding Notes of $2.3 million were redeemed for cash on the redemption date. The Company securitizes, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of trade accounts receivable in Japan and, until August 2008, in the United States. The benefits of the securitizations were traditionally lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity. The Company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to borrowings under the current LIBOR based credit facility. In August 2008, the Company terminated its securitization program in the United States, and repurchased $50.0 million of accounts receivable, as the program no longer offered an attractive financing alternative. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had sold, under its Japan securitization program, a total of $44.4 million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of $37.7 million. The securitization program in Japan will expire on February 28, 2009, and the Company does not plan to renew it as the program no longer offers an attractive financing alternative. This will result in a reduction in cash flows from operating activities in the first quarter of 2009 of approximately $45 million. In December 2007, the Company received notification that the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund in which the Company had invested $50.1 million as of December 31, 2007, was being closed to new subscriptions or redemptions, resulting in the Companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized realized losses and unrealized losses considered other than temporary of $3.0 million, included in "Other Expense (Income), net." During 2008, the Company received cash redemptions of $35.5 million. The fair value of the Companys remaining investment in this fund as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was estimated to be $10.9 million and $49.4 million, respectively, based on the net asset value of the fund. Based on information received from the fund manager regarding the 36 Table of Contents timing of the expected redemptions, the Company expects to receive cash redemptions for approximately $8.1 million during 2009, which has been classified as "Short term Investments" on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. The remaining $2.8 million of the investment is expected to be received after December 31, 2009, and has been classified as "Other Assets." In January 2008, the Company completed the sale of certain assets related to the Edwards LifeStent peripheral vascular product line. This divestiture was part of the Companys ongoing strategy to focus resources on its core Heart Valve and Critical Care product lines. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received an initial cash payment of $74.0 million at closing, and is entitled to receive up to an additional $65.0 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones, including the receipt of United States regulatory approval of the Companys LifeStent products for a superficial femoral artery indication and the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing. The Company has agreed to provide transition services until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer. In December 2008, the Company recorded a gain of $23.0 million for the receipt of a LifeStent milestone payment in connection with the transfer of its PMA to the buyer. In February 2009, the Company received an additional $27.0 million milestone payment upon receipt of the United States regulatory approval, and the remaining $15.0 million milestone payment will be recorded upon the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing to the buyer. In September 2007, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to $250.0 million of the Companys common stock. In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to an additional $250.0 million of the Companys common stock. Stock repurchased under these programs will be used primarily to offset obligations under the Companys employee stock option programs and reduce the total shares outstanding. During 2008, the Company repurchased 5.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $306.5 million and has remaining authority under the July 2008 program to purchase $193.5 million of the Companys common stock. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $153.2 million for 2008 decreased $59.9 million from 2007 primarily due to a $50.0 million cash payment during 2008 to terminate the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in the United States. In addition, 2008 operating cash flow was negatively impacted by net cash outflows from the Japan accounts receivable securitization program, partially offset by net cash inflows resulting from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2008. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $213.1 million for 2007 decreased $19.6 million from 2006 primarily due to $23.8 million received in 2006 for the patent litigation settlement with Medtronic and higher tax payments in 2007, partially offset by net cash inflows resulting from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2007. Net cash provided by investing activities of $58.8 million in 2008 consisted primarily of $97.0 million of cash received from the sale of the LifeStent product line and a related milestone achievement, and $35.5 million in cash redemptions associated with the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, partially offset by capital expenditures of $50.6 million and a $27.4 million purchase of intangible assets, primarily due to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property. Net cash used in investing activities of $147.4 million in 2007 consisted primarily of (1) capital expenditures of $57.0 million, (2) a $55.0 million reclassification from cash to short term investments associated with the closing of the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, as explained previously, (3) a $27.2 million payment associated with the acquisition of certain assets of CardioVations, and (4) a $9.8 million milestone payment associated with the 2004 PVT acquisition. Net cash used in financing activities of $134.1 million in 2008 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $306.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from long term debt of $94.2 million and the proceeds from stock plans of $63.8 million. 37 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities of $108.1 million in 2007 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $130.9 million and net payments on long term debt of $27.9 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $38.7 million. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008 were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt $ 175.5 $ $ 175.5 $ $ Interest on long term debt 4.7 1.7 3.0 Operating leases 51.2 16.3 19.9 9.1 5.9 Pension obligation(a) 3.3 3.3 Contractual development obligations(b) 40.0 17.3 17.3 5.4 Capital commitment obligations(c) 5.5 2.8 2.7 Total contractual cash obligations(d) $ 280.2 $ 41.4 $ 218.4 $ 14.5 $ 5.9 (a)The amount included in "Less than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to the Companys various pension plans. Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. The total accrued benefit liability for the Companys pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2008 was $32.5 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, the Company did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. See Note 11 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information. (b)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones. (c)Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees. These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made. (d)As of December 31, 2008, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $38.4 million. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows associated with these liabilities, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Companys accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Companys transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions. Management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies. Management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated 38 Table of Contents affiliates, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, income taxes, any impairments of assets, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves, and contingencies. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return, and no unusual provisions or conditions. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Companys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted. The Companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on third party data, as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations. The Companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Companys United States distributors and represents the difference between the Companys sales price to the distributor (at the Companys distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer. This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor. The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from the largest distributors. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. The Company continually monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated. The Company also offers volume rebates to certain GPOs and customers based upon target sales levels. These volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO. The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid. The Company continually monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated. Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. An allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales. 39  Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $9.9 million and $7.5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. Inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged, or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply). The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $13.2 million and $14.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Patent Costs The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks. These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark. Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes the two step goodwill impairment test as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. Since the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value. Additionally, in accordance with SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. 40 Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term, strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development. Certain of these investments are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as "Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income." Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investees outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded at the amount of the Companys investment and adjusted each period for the Companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid. As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value. When the fair value of an available for sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a recognized loss: the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investees performance against product development milestones; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Income Taxes Income taxes are determined under guidelines prescribed by SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). Under these guidelines, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 41 Table of Contents Stock based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values. Stock based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period). Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units, the Company issues common stock. Fair Value Measurements On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), with respect to its financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company has deferred the application of the provisions of this statement for its non financial assets and liabilities in accordance with FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 157 2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157" ("FSP 157 2"). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches, including market, income and or cost approaches, and considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Upon adoption of SFAS 157, the Company applied the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets or liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, the Company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement. The Company has procedures to independently verify and test valuations received from third parties. The financial assets and liabilities that the Company records at fair value include investments in marketable securities, residual interests in securitizations, and derivative instruments. Investments in Marketable Securities Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash Fund The Company holds an investment in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund, which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in December 2007, resulting in the Companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash. The fair value of the Companys remaining investment in this fund was estimated based on the net asset value of the fund. As of December 31, 2008, the net asset value of the fund was 82.66% of par. The fair value of the underlying securities held by the fund was determined based on quoted market prices or broker quotes, when possible. In the absence of observable market quotations, the underlying securities were valued based on alternative valuation techniques using inputs that may not be observable. 42 Table of Contents In these cases, the fair value was based on available information believed to be reliable, which may be affected by conditions in the financial markets. Different market participants may reach different opinions as to the value of any particular security based on their varying market outlooks, the market information available to them, and the particular circumstances of their portfolios. A decrease in the net asset value of 1%, or 83 basis points, would result in a decrease of approximately $0.1 million in the investment fair value. The Companys investment in the fund is categorized as Level 3 based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Investments Held for the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan The Company holds investments in trading securities related to its executive deferred compensation plan. The fair values of the securities are based on quoted market prices and are categorized as Level 1. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Certain of the Companys investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115. These investments are carried at fair market value based on quoted market prices and are categorized as Level 1. Residual Interest in Securitizations When the Company sells accounts receivable securitizations, a subordinated residual interest in the securitized portfolio is retained by the Company. The Company estimates the fair value of the residual interest using the net carrying amount of the accounts receivables less the discount paid on the sale of the receivables. This amount is calculated using future expected credit losses and calculated contractual rebates to distributors to determine the future expected cash flows, which generally approximate fair value given the securitized portfolios short term weighted average life. Reserves for credit losses included in the allowance for doubtful accounts are adjusted based on managements assessment of recovery. The United States securitization program was terminated in August 2008 and all receivables sold under this facility were repurchased by the Company. The residual interest in the Japan securitization program is categorized as Level 3. Derivative Instruments The Company uses forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to forecasted intercompany and third party foreign currency transactions. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. The fair value for derivatives is determined based on indicative mid market data levels for spot rate and forward points as of the close of business on December 31, 2008. All values are discounted to present from the expiry date. The values of options are calculated based on the forward implied volatilities to the expiry date. The models used for valuations are based upon well recognized financial principles, and the predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources. Although readily observable data is used in the valuations, different valuation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair value. The derivative instruments are categorized as Level 2. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 2, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 3, "Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active" ("FSP 157 3"). FSP 157 3 clarifies the 43 Table of Contents application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP 157 3 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Companys adoption of SFAS 157, except as it applies to those non financial assets and liabilities affected by the one year delay, did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 related to its non financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The adoption of FSP 157 3 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in comprehensive income. In addition, SFAS 158 requires employers to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet. SFAS 158 provides different effective dates for the recognition and related disclosure provisions, and for the required change to a fiscal year end measurement date. In December 2006, the Company applied the requirements to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans and made the required disclosures. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end balance sheet was effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. SFAS 158 provides two approaches for transitioning to a fiscal year end measurement date. The Company adopted the measurement date provisions using the "one measurement" approach. Under this approach, the Company used the measurement determined as of October 31, 2007 and recognized the net benefit expense for the transition period from November 1 through December 31, 2007 in retained earnings at December 31, 2008. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 resulted in a $0.6 million reduction of retained earnings. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 allows reporting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments at fair value and incorporates an amendment to SFAS 115, which is applicable to all entities with trading securities or securities that are considered to be available for sale. The provisions within SFAS 159 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company adopted SFAS 159 effective January 1, 2008. The Company has not elected the fair value option for its financial instruments. As required by SFAS 159, the Company has reclassified all cash flows related to its trading securities from operating to investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. In June 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") in EITF Issue No. 07 3, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities" ("EITF 07 3"). EITF 07 3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized until the related service is performed or the goods are delivered. EITF 07 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" ("SFAS 162"). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. SFAS 162 was effective November 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4, "Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161" ("FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4"). FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4 amends and enhances disclosure requirements for sellers of credit derivatives and financial 44 Table of Contents guarantees. It also clarifies that the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" ("SFAS 161"), are effective for quarterly periods beginning after November 15, 2008, and fiscal years that include those periods. FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4 was effective for reporting periods (annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, "Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities" ("FSP 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8"). FSP 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 requires additional disclosures about an entitys involvement with variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Among other requirements, SFAS 141R expands the definition of a business combination, requires acquisitions to be accounted for at fair value, and requires transaction costs and restructuring charges to be expensed. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R will impact the Company if it is involved in a business combination. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161. SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities, including (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP 142 3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets" ("FSP 142 3"). FSP 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142. FSP 142 3 applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142 3 also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives. FSP 142 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP 142 3 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF in EITF Issue No. 08 6, "Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations" ("EITF 08 6"). EITF 08 6 clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. EITF 08 6 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 08 6 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF in EITF Issue No. 08 7, "Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets" ("EITF 08 7"). EITF 08 7 clarifies the accounting for certain separately identifiable intangible assets which an acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them. EITF 08 7 requires an acquirer in a business combination to account for a defensive intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting which should be amortized to expense over a period the asset diminishes in value. EITF 08 7 is effective for fiscal years 45 Table of Contents beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 08 7 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP 132(R) 1, "Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets" ("FSP 132(R) 1"). FSP 132(R) 1 requires additional disclosures about (a) how investment allocation decisions are made by management, (b) major categories of plan assets, (c) inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements, including disclosures similar to that required under SFAS 157, and (d) significant concentrations of risk. FSP 132(R) 1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP 132(R) 1 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk, opportunity, and costs. Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, option based products, and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $225.1 million and $336.2 million, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, option based products, and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the Companys exposure through its use of derivatives. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis. There were no interest rate swaps in effect as of December 31, 2008. As part of its overall risk management program, the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 14 basis point increase in interest rates (approximately 10% of the Companys weighted average interest rate) affecting the Companys financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments, would have an immaterial effect on the Companys annual interest expense. Currency Risk The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese yen and the Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net United States dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the 46 Table of Contents carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option based products consist of purchased put options and, at times, written (sold) call options to create collars. Option based products are agreements that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels. As part of its risk management process, the Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, with a 95 percent confidence level and a 14 day holding period, to estimate this potential loss. The Companys calculated VAR at December 31, 2008 and 2007 with a maturity of up to one year, was $5.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively. This amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Companys calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future. Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default, and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counterparty diversification, monitoring of counterparty financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2008 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2008, all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "A" or better by national rating agencies. The Company does not anticipate non performance by its counterparties and has no reserves related to non performance as of December 31, 2008. The Company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in April 2000. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers, and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses. In 2008, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net. Investment Risk Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies. These investments are classified in "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets. 47 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately $14.7 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized losses of $5.7 million on these investments in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income," net of tax. Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary. The Company holds an investment in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund, which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in December 2007, resulting in the Companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized realized losses and unrealized losses considered other than temporary of $3.0 million, included in "Other Expense (Income), net." During 2008, the Company received cash redemptions of $35.5 million. The fair value of the Companys remaining investment in this fund as of December 31, 2008 was estimated to be $10.9 million based on the net asset value of the fund. Based on information received from the fund manager regarding the timing of the expected redemptions, the Company expects to receive cash redemptions for approximately $8.1 million through the fourth quarter of 2009, which has been classified as "Short term Investments" on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. The remaining $2.8 million of the investment is expected to be received after December 31, 2009, and has been classified as "Other Assets." The markets relating to these investments are subject to ongoing illiquidity and remain uncertain. There may be further decreases in the value of these investments until the fund is fully liquidated. 48  Table of Contents
