Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2009. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2009. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is a global leader in products and technologies designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. The Company is focused specifically on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients. The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences are categorized into four main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; and Vascular. Previously, Edwards Lifesciences provided Other Distributed Products, which included sales of intra aortic balloon pumps and other products sold primarily through the Companys distribution network in Japan. Edwards terminated its distribution agreement for these products at the end of December 2007. Edwards Lifesciences Heart Valve Therapy portfolio is comprised of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products. A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the Critical Care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring equipment used to measure a patients cardiovascular function, and in disposable pressure transducers. Prior to September 2009, Edwards Lifesciences provided central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery ("hemofiltration product line"). The Company sold the hemofiltration 21 Table of Contents product line effective September 1, 2009. The Companys Cardiac Surgery Systems portfolio comprises a diverse line of products for use during cardiac surgery including cannulae, EMBOL X technologies and other disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Cardiac Surgery Systems also included transmyocardial revascularization ("TMR") products until March 2007 when the Company sold the distribution rights to its TMR products. In December 2007, the Company acquired the CardioVations line of products used in MIS. Edwards Lifesciences Vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, and artificial implantable grafts. Edwards Lifesciences manufactured and sold LifeStent balloon expandable and self expanding non coronary stents until the sale of this product line in January 2008. The Company continued to manufacture these products for the buyer until September 2009 when manufacturing was transferred to the buyer. The healthcare marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors. The Company competes with many companies, ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than Edwards Lifesciences with access to significant financial resources. Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the Company competes. Global demand for healthcare is increasing as the population ages. There is mounting pressure to contain healthcare costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. The cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic, and technology, cost of care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change. Results of Operations Net Sales Trends The following is a summary of United States and international net sales (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2009 2008 United States $ 556.1 $ 543.6 $ 486.6 $ 12.5 $ 57.0 2.3 % 11.7 % Europe 404.6 380.3 309.1 24.3 71.2 6.4 % 23.0 % Japan 214.1 176.5 171.4 37.6 5.1 21.3 % 3.0 % Rest of World 146.6 137.3 124.0 9.3 13.3 6.8 % 10.7 % International 765.3 694.1 604.5 71.2 89.6 10.3 % 14.8 % Total net sales $ 1,321.4 $ 1,237.7 $ 1,091.1 $ 83.7 $ 146.6 6.8 % 13.4 % The $12.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2009 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased sales by $33.6 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease and Magna with ThermaFix valves, and the Carpentier Edwards Physio II ring, which was launched in the first quarter of 2009; partially offset by: the divestiture of the LifeStent product line in mid January 2008, which decreased net sales by $23.2 million. LifeStent sales after the divestiture resulted from the on going manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement, which continued until the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer in September 2009. 22 Table of Contents The $71.2 million increase in international net sales in 2009 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $80.0 million, driven primarily by the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve and the Magna aortic valve in Japan; and Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $19.6 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system and pressure monitoring products; partially offset by: foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $15.2 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar; and hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $10.6 million. The Company sold its hemofiltration product line effective September 1, 2009. For more information see "Special (Gains) Charges, net." The $57.0 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2008 was due primarily to: CardioVations MIS products, which increased net sales by $23.7 million. The Company purchased the CardioVations MIS product line in December 2007; LifeStent products (all of which were recorded in the United States in 2008), which increased net sales by $13.7 million. LifeStent sales include end customer sales recorded prior to the divestiture of LifeStent in mid January 2008, and sales after the divestiture resulting from the on going manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement, which continued until the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer in September 2009; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $13.8 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, hemofiltration products and pressure monitoring products; and Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $7.3 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna with ThermaFix valve and the Magna mitral valve, partially offset by a reduction in net sales due to the voluntary retrieval of the Companys Myxo and IMR ETlogix repair products pending FDA clearance of its 510(k) submissions. The $89.6 million increase in international net sales in 2008 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $70.7 million, driven primarily by the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve and the launch of the Magna aortic valve in Japan; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $22.9 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system, pressure monitoring products and hemofiltration products; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $37.3 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar; partially offset by: a decrease of $41.3 million related to the discontinuation of distributed sales in Japan of intra aortic balloon pumps and the divestiture of the LifeStent product line. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Companys hedging activities. For more information see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 23 Table of Contents Net Sales by Product Line The following is a summary of net sales by product line (dollars in millions): Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2009 2008 Heart Valve Therapy $ 714.9 $ 607.4 $ 515.0 $ 107.5 $ 92.4 17.7 % 17.9 % Critical Care 452.5 451.8 397.8 0.7 54.0 0.2 % 13.6 % Cardiac Surgery Systems 92.8 89.2 60.9 3.6 28.3 4.0 % 46.5 % Vascular 61.2 89.3 90.0 (28.1 ) (0.7 ) (31.5 )% (0.8 )% Other Distributed Products 27.4 (27.4 ) % (100.0 )% Total net sales $ 1,321.4 $ 1,237.7 $ 1,091.1 $ 83.7 $ 146.6 6.8 % 13.4 % Heart Valve Therapy The $107.5 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2009 was due primarily to: the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, which increased net sales by $59.5 million; pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $41.7 million, primarily as a result of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve, the Magna with ThermaFix mitral valve and the Magna aortic valve in Japan; and the launch of the Carpentier Edwards Physio II ring in the first quarter of 2009, which increased net sales by $12.0 million; partially offset by: foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $8.6 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The $92.4 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2008 was due primarily to: the launch of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in Europe during the fourth quarter of 2007, which increased net sales by $47.7 million; pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $32.4 million, primarily as a result of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve, the Magna with ThermaFix aortic valve and the launch of the Magna aortic valve in Japan; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $17.4 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The Company expects that its SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve will continue to be a strong contributor to 2010 sales. The Company also expects that the launches of its newly approved Magna valves will enable the Company to continue its surgical heart valve sales momentum in 2010. The Company received FDA approval for its Magna Ease aortic valve in May 2009. The Magna Ease valve is designed for easier implantation and has the potential for leadership in the largest segment of surgical valve replacement. In July 2009, the Company received United States regulatory approval for its Magna mitral valve, called the Magna Mitral Ease. The Magna Mitral Ease will extend the Magna platform by providing improved MIS capabilities and ease of implantation. The Company initiated a limited launch during the fourth quarter of 2009 and plans a broader introduction of Magna Mitral Ease in the United States and Europe during the third quarter of 2010. In January 2010, the Company completed first in man procedures and initiated a small clinical feasibility study in Europe, called TRITON, for a novel minimally invasive aortic valve surgery system, called 24 Table of Contents Project Odyssey. The Project Odyssey system leverages the design of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease tissue heart valve to create a new valve platform with an innovative delivery and attachment system. It is designed to enable a faster procedure, shorter patient time on cardiopulmonary bypass and a smaller incision. The Company launched the Carpentier Edwards Physio II ring in the United States and Europe during the first quarter of 2009, and in Japan during the first quarter of 2010. The Company expects this product to contribute to its growth in the repair segment. Physio II is the next generation repair product for the degenerative segment of mitral repair. In Japan, the Company received regulatory approval for its IMR ETlogix ring during the first quarter of 2009, and launched this product in Japan during the third quarter of 2009. Critical Care The $0.7 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2009 was due primarily to: FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $14.2 million; and core Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $4.3 million, driven primarily by pressure monitoring products; partially offset by: hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $13.6 million. The Company sold its hemofiltration product line effective September 1, 2009. For more information see "Special (Gains) Charges, net"; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $4.1 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The $54.0 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2008 was due primarily to: FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $17.5 million; core Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $12.0 million, driven primarily by market share gains in pressure monitoring products and PreSep, the Companys central venous oximetry catheter for early detection of sepsis; hemofiltration products, which increased net sales by $7.3 million; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $15.5 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The Company expects worldwide FloTrac systems sales will continue to be a significant contributor to 2010 Critical Care sales growth, and that it will continue to expand the market for minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company launched a third generation algorithm enhancement for the FloTrac system that enhances its accuracy when used in patients with sepsis and other critical illnesses. In the second quarter of 2010, the Company expects to launch a substantial upgrade designed to strengthen the FloTrac systems applicability in the medical intensive care unit. Also in the second quarter of 2010, the Company expects to launch a new hardware platform with a simpler, more intuitive informational display, and expects to ultimately consolidate all parameters into one new hardware platform. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with DexCom, Inc. ("DexCom") to develop products for continuously monitoring blood glucose levels in patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions. During the third quarter of 2009, the first of two clinical studies to validate performance and support regulatory approval was completed. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company received CE Mark and began clinical evaluation of its first generation product in a limited number of European sites. In 2010, the Company plans to continue conducting post CE Mark trials in Europe and implement system enhancements. In the United States, the Company anticipates filing for regulatory approval in the middle of 2010. 25  Table of Contents Cardiac Surgery Systems The $3.6 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2009 was due primarily to MIS products, which increased net sales by $2.8 million. The $28.3 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2008 was due primarily to the acquisition of the CardioVations MIS product line in December 2007, which increased net sales by $30.1 million. This increase was partially offset by the discontinuation of the Brazil based perfusion product line, which resulted in a net sales decrease of $4.4 million. Vascular The $28.1 million decrease in net sales of Vascular products in 2009 was due primarily to reduced sales of the LifeStent product line which was divested in January 2008. Sales after the divestiture resulted from the on going manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement, which continued until the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer in September 2009. The $0.7 million decrease in net sales of Vascular products in 2008 was due primarily to the divestiture of the LifeStent product line. Other Distributed Products The $27.4 million decrease in net sales of Other Distributed Products in 2008 was due primarily to the termination at the end of 2007 of intra aortic balloon pump distributed sales in Japan. Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 69.8 % 66.1 % 65.3 % 3.7 pts. 0.8 pts. The 3.7 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2009 was driven by: a 1.5 percentage point increase in the United States due primarily to a more profitable product mix, primarily from reduced sales of LifeStent products under the manufacturing requirements of the LifeStent sale agreement and higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products; a 1.4 percentage point increase in international markets due to a more profitable product mix, primarily higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products and FloTrac systems; and the impact from the expiration of foreign currency hedging contracts. The 0.8 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2008 was driven by: a 2.1 percentage point increase in international markets due to a more profitable product mix, primarily related to higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products and FloTrac systems, combined with the discontinuation of lower margin perfusion products and intra aortic balloon pumps; partially offset by: a 0.5 percentage point decrease in the United States due primarily to sales of LifeStent products under the on going manufacturing requirements of the LifeStent sale agreement, partially offset by a more profitable product mix, primarily higher sales of FloTrac systems; and the impact from the expiration of foreign currency hedging contracts. 26 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 SG&A expenses $ 508.8 $ 480.6 $ 418.0 $ 28.2 $ 62.6 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 38.5 % 38.8 % 38.3 % (0.3 ) pts. 0.5 pts. The $28.2 million increase in SG&A expenses in 2009 was due primarily to (1) investments for the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve program in Europe and (2) higher sales related spending in the Heart Valve Therapy product line. The increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency (primarily the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar) in the amount of $5.4 million. The $62.6 million increase in SG&A expenses and the 0.5 percentage point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2008 were due primarily to (1) higher sales related spending, including investments for the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve launch in Europe, (2) the impact of foreign currency (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar) in the amount of $16.7 million and (3) higher compensation expense related to the Companys strong sales performance. Research and Development Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Research and development expenses $ 175.5 $ 139.2 $ 122.3 $ 36.3 $ 16.9 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 13.3 % 11.2 % 11.2 % 2.1 pts. The increase in research and development expenses in 2009 was due primarily to additional investments in transcatheter heart valve and glucose programs. The increase in research and development expenses in 2008 was due primarily to additional investments in transcatheter and surgical heart valve programs. The following are the developments related to the Companys transcatheter aortic valve replacement program (formerly Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc.s ("PVT") percutaneous aortic valve program): the Company received conditional Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") approval from the FDA in March 2007 to initiate its PARTNER trial, a pivotal clinical trial of the Companys Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve technology. The PARTNER trial, which has two study arms, began enrollment during the second quarter of 2007 and is evaluating the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in patients who are considered at high risk for conventional open heart valve surgery. In the first study arm ("Cohort A"), patients are randomized on a 1:1 basis to either high risk surgery or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. Enrollment of 690 patients in Cohort A, which is a non inferiority analysis, was completed in the third quarter of 2009. In the second study arm ("Cohort B"), patients who are deemed non operable are randomized 1:1 to medical management or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. Enrollment of 350 patients in Cohort B, which is a superiority analysis, was completed in the first quarter of 2009. In addition, the Company received FDA approval for non randomized continued access for all of its existing PARTNER sites. The Company anticipates submitting Cohort B to the FDA for approval during the fourth quarter of 2010, and Cohort A in mid 2011. A favorable data comparison and an expected one year approval process would result in United States approval of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve for medically managed patients in 2011; 27 Table of Contents the Company received CE Mark in the fourth quarter of 2008 for European commercial sales of its RetroFlex 3 transfemoral delivery system, which simplifies the delivery of its SAPIEN valve. In addition, in the first quarter of 2009, the Company received IDE approval to use its RetroFlex 3 delivery system in its United States PARTNER trial; the Company began its United States feasibility trial of the SAPIEN valve in the pulmonic position in April 2008. The goal of this clinical study is to enable physicians to offer a minimally invasive alternative to patients with a failing pulmonic valve, using the Companys transcatheter valve platform and RetroFlex delivery system. Upon completion of enrollment, the Company intends to transition to a larger humanitarian device exemption trial; first in man cases using the Companys next generation transcatheter heart valve, the Edwards SAPIEN XT, were performed during the first quarter of 2008. In December 2008, the first three implants were performed in the CE Mark trial. In the second quarter of 2009, the first implants were performed with SAPIEN XT and NovaFlex, the Companys next generation transfemoral delivery system. The Company believes that this next generation valves features will help reduce its delivery profile without compromising strength, enabling it to better address the requirements of transfemoral delivery. The Company anticipates European approval and limited launch of SAPIEN XT with NovaFlex in the first quarter of 2010. The first in man cases in the PREVAIL TA study, which uses the SAPIEN XT with the lower profile Ascendra 2 transapical delivery system, were performed in the third quarter of 2009. The Company anticipates a limited European launch of SAPIEN XT with Ascendra 2 in the second quarter of 2010; in the United States, the Company submitted an IDE for SAPIEN XT in October 2009. This clinical trial, called PARTNER 2, will evaluate the SAPIEN XT with both the NovaFlex and Ascendra 2 delivery systems and will target the same high risk patients studied in the PARTNER trial. The Company received questions from the FDA and is working closely with them to further the approval process. Based on the current rigorous regulatory environment, trial approval may be delayed into the second quarter of 2010; and in Japan, the Company completed its first compassionate use cases with the SAPIEN valve using both the transapical and transfemoral delivery systems in October 2009. The Company intends to start a clinical trial with its SAPIEN XT valve during the second quarter of 2010. Successful trial completion could result in an approval as early as 2013. The following are the activities related to the Companys transcatheter mitral valve program (formerly ev3, Inc.s ("ev3") percutaneous mitral valve repair program): in October 2008, the Company announced the continuation of the EVOLUTION II clinical trial of the Edwards MONARC system which is deployed into the coronary sinus. The Company has expanded the trial to include specialty heart failure centers in order to increase the pace of enrollment. Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses The information in "Purchased in process Research and Development Expenses" related to regulatory milestones describes the Companys expectations with respect to the applicable programs at the time of the respective acquisitions and does not reflect subsequent activities or expectations. Refer to "Research and Development Expenses" above for the current status of these programs, the Companys expectations and the financial impact from changes in the Companys expectations. On September 29, 2004, the Company acquired all technology and intellectual property associated with ev3s percutaneous mitral valve repair program for total consideration of $15.0 million. The acquired assets were expected to be utilized in the Companys existing percutaneous mitral valve repair research and development efforts. At the time of the purchase, ev3 had been unsuccessful in developing a viable product prototype and had discontinued the program. Completion of successful design developments, bench testing, 28 Table of Contents pre clinical studies and human clinical studies were required prior to selling any product. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time included those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $12.3 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 30%. The valuation assumed approximately $39.0 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. At the time of the valuation, the Companys assumptions included estimated completion in 2009 of the mitral valve repair program utilizing the intellectual property acquired from ev3, and commencement in 2010 of net cash inflows. The remaining fair market value of the assets purchased consisted primarily of patents unrelated to ev3s core mitral valve repair technology, which are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 19 years. On January 27, 2004, the Company acquired PVT, a development stage company, for $125.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus up to an additional $30.0 million upon the achievement of key milestones through 2007. Included in PVTs technology was a catheter based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves, comprised of a proprietary, percutaneously delivered balloon expandable stent technology integrated with a tissue heart valve. Unlike conventional open heart valve replacement surgery, this less invasive procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and could potentially be a breakthrough for patients seeking an alternative to open heart surgery. At the time of acquisition, the PVT aortic heart valve was being used in compassionate cases in Europe, and these clinical results had generated valuable feasibility data. It had been demonstrated that a heart valve could be successfully deployed and anchored using a catheter based system. Also at that time, PVT was expecting to obtain a CE Mark in Europe by the end of 2005 and to file for a Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") in the United States. Upon approval of the HDE, PVT would be able to offer this device to as many as 4,000 patients per year. Broader commercialization in the United States was expected to begin with the submission of an IDE by the end of the second quarter of 2004 followed by the commencement of a pivotal trial in 2005 and possible pre market approval by the end of 2007. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time included those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. Approximately $81.0 million of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development in 2004. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 25%. The valuation assumed approximately $20.9 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, net cash inflows were forecasted to commence in 2007. The remaining fair market value of the net assets acquired consisted primarily of patents of $72.4 million that are being amortized over their estimated economic life of 11 years, and a deferred tax liability related to the patents of $28.1 million. 29 Table of Contents Special (Gains) Charges, net Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Gain on sale of assets, net $ (86.9 ) $ (14.9 ) $ (1.8 ) Charitable fund contribution 15.0 Settlements and litigation, net 3.8 0.6 Adjustment to capitalized patent enforcement costs 3.7 8.2 Investment impairment 1.6 Reserve reversal (1.0 ) Acquisition of in process technology and intellectual property 19.5 DexCom collaboration agreement 13.4 Realignment expenses, net (1.7 ) 13.9 Pension settlement and adjustment 11.2 Total special (gains) charges, net $ (63.8 ) $ 25.1 $ 23.3 Gain on Sale of Assets, net Effective September 1, 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $55.9 million, and may receive up to an additional $9.0 million upon the buyers achievement of certain revenue objectives over the next two years, of which $2.1 million was earned in 2009 and recorded in "Other (Income) Expense, net." The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $43.6 million consisting of the cash proceeds of $55.9 million, offset by $8.5 million related to the net book value of inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets that were sold, a $0.6 million satisfaction of a receivable, a $0.5 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line and $2.7 million of transaction and other costs related to the sale. In connection with this transaction, the Company also recorded a $1.5 million charge in June 2009 for transaction costs and employee severance related to the pending sale. The Company will provide transition services to the buyer. This transaction allows the Company to better focus on its global strategic priorities. In March 2009, the Company recorded a $2.8 million gain related to the sale of its distribution rights in Europe for a specialty vascular graft. In January 2008, the Company sold certain assets related to the Edwards LifeStent peripheral vascular product line. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received an initial cash payment of $74.0 million at closing, and was entitled to receive up to an additional $65.0 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones. In addition, the Company agreed to provide transition services until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer. In December 2008, the Company received a $23.0 million LifeStent milestone payment in connection with the transfer of its pre market approval to the buyer. In February 2009, the Company received an additional $27.0 million milestone payment associated with the LifeStent pre market approval. In September 2009, the Company earned the remaining $15.0 million milestone payment upon the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing to the buyer. In connection with the LifeStent transaction, the Company recorded in January 2008 a pre tax loss of $8.1 million consisting of the cash proceeds of $74.0 million, offset by a $34.6 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line, $36.9 million related to the net book value of inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets that were sold, $6.9 million of deferred revenue related to the transition services the Company agreed to provide and $3.7 million of transaction and other costs related to the sale. In December 2007, the Company recorded a gain of $1.8 million for the sale of real estate development rights in Irvine, California, that had no book value at the time of sale. 30 Table of Contents Charitable Fund Contribution In September 2009, the Company contributed $15.0 million to The Edwards Lifesciences Fund, a donor advised fund intended to provide philanthropic support to cardiovascular and community related charitable causes. The contribution was an irrevocable contribution to a third party, and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment. Settlements and Litigation, net In September 2009, the Company recorded a $3.8 million charge for litigation related to a royalty dispute in connection with a product in the Companys Cardiac Surgery Systems product line. In December 2008, the Company recorded a $1.5 million insurance settlement gain related to a fire that occurred in the third quarter of 2007 which damaged certain inventory held at a third party warehouse in Brazil. In March 2008, the Company recorded a $2.1 million charge for the settlement of litigation related to its divested United States perfusion services business. Under the terms of the divestiture, this was the Companys last outstanding case. Adjustment to Capitalized Patent Enforcement Costs In December 2009, the Company recorded a $3.7 million charge for the write off of capitalized patent enforcement costs related to litigation in Europe for which success was no longer deemed probable. In December 2008, the Company recorded an $8.2 million charge due primarily to the reversal of capitalized patent enforcement costs for a litigated claim related to patents in a product area where the Company did not then, and does not currently, compete and where the related patent enforcement costs, therefore, should be expensed as incurred. The Company recorded the correction of this error in the fourth quarter of 2008. Approximately $5.7 million of the charge related to 2007 and 2006, and $2.5 million related to the first, second and third quarters of 2008. The Company concluded that the out of period amounts were not material to any of the prior years financial statements, and the impact of the correcting adjustment is not material to the full year 2008 financial statements. Investment Impairment In September 2009, the Company recorded a $1.6 million charge related to the other than temporary impairment of its technology investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. The Company concluded that the impairment of its investment was other than temporary based upon (a) the continuing duration and severity of the impairment and (b) positive clinical trial developments in the third quarter of 2009 which failed to raise the quoted market price of the affiliates stock to the Companys carrying value. Reserve Reversal In 2004, the Company discontinued its Lifepath AAA endovascular graft program. In March 2009, upon completion of its remaining clinical obligations related to this program, the Company reversed its remaining $1.0 million clinical reserve. Acquisition of In Process Technology and Intellectual Property In October 2008, the Company recorded a $5.0 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property. The acquired technology is being developed for use in restoring heart geometry and function and offers a reshaping solution for patients who suffer from debilitating functional mitral regurgitation. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. 31 Table of Contents In November 2008, the Company recorded a $13.2 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property, primarily related to a product which is currently under development, and certain tangible assets, including prototypes and equipment used in the development of the product. The acquired technology is being developed for use in hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company must pay an additional &euro;3.0 million (US$4.3 million) milestone payment should the Company achieve net sales of the product in Europe of &euro;6.4 million (US$9.1 million) in any four consecutive quarters in the first five years following market launch in Europe. In December 2008, the Company recorded a $1.3 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property related to a device for the reduction or elimination of mitral regurgitation and the control of left ventricular dilation. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. DexCom Collaboration Agreement In November 2008, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with DexCom to develop products for continuously monitoring blood glucose levels in patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions. The agreement provides Edwards Lifesciences with an exclusive license to all of DexComs applicable intellectual property. The Company recorded a charge of $13.4 million related to the upfront licensing and collaboration fee. Edwards Lifesciences will also pay up to $24.0 million over the next three years in product development costs and regulatory approval milestones. In addition, DexCom will receive either a profit sharing payment or a royalty based upon commercial sales. Edwards Lifesciences will be responsible for global sales and marketing, which is expected to begin in 2010, and DexCom will be responsible for initial manufacturing. Realignment Expenses, net In March 2008, the Company recorded a $1.3 million charge for executive severance associated with the Companys business realignment. As of December 31, 2009, payments related to the executive severance charge were substantially complete. In December 2007, the Company recorded realignment expenses of $13.9 million primarily related to (1) severance expenses associated with the sale of the Companys LifeStent product line and a global reduction in workforce, primarily in the United States, Europe and Japan (impacting approximately 180 employees) and (2) the termination of the Companys intra aortic balloon pump distribution agreement in Japan. In 2008, the Company reversed $3.0 million of the December 2007 accrued severance related to the sale of the LifeStent product line and global reduction in workforce. As of December 31, 2009, payments related to the realignment were substantially complete. Pension Settlement and Adjustment In December 2007, the Companys Puerto Rico pension plan was settled and benefits were distributed to the participants through a combination of lump sum payments and the purchase of annuities. The Company recorded a charge of $7.1 million in December 2007 related to the settlement. In December 2007, the Company applied the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 715 to a defined benefit pension plan in Switzerland, which had previously been accounted for as a defined contribution plan. The Company recorded a charge of $4.1 million in December 2007 to correct this error. The Company concluded that the impact of the increase in the pension obligation was not material to the 2007 or prior years consolidated financial statements. 32  Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense was $2.7 million, $7.2 million and $9.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $4.5 million decrease in interest expense for 2009 resulted primarily from lower interest rates and a lower average debt balance as compared to the prior year. The $1.9 million decrease in interest expense for 2008 resulted primarily from lower interest rates as compared to the prior year. Interest Income Interest income was $1.6 million, $6.1 million and $7.7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $4.5 million and $1.6 million decreases in interest income for 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulted primarily from lower average interest rates. Other (Income) Expense, net The following is a summary of other (income) expense, net (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net $ (2.3 ) $ 7.2 $ (2.0 ) Earn out payments (2.1 ) (2.3 ) Gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates (1.2 ) (2.0 ) (1.3 ) Investment realized (gains) losses and impairment (0.5 ) 3.0 0.7 Accounts receivable securitization costs 1.6 3.0 Other 2.4 (2.1 ) $ (3.7 ) $ 7.7 $ (1.9 ) The foreign exchange (gains) losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations in the Companys global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances. Foreign exchange resulted in a net gain in 2009 compared to a net loss in 2008 due primarily to fluctuations in the Euro. In September 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line. In connection with the transaction, the Company is entitled to earn out payments up to $9.0 million based on certain revenue objectives to be achieved by the buyer over the next two years. During 2009, the Company earned $2.1 million. In March 2007, the Company sold the United States distribution rights and inventory associated with the TMR laser product line to Novadaq Technologies, Inc. ("Novadaq") for up front consideration of $5.4 million, which consisted of $2.4 million in cash and a $3.0 million senior secured promissory note, which was collected in full during the third quarter of 2007. This resulted in a gain of $0.3 million. In connection with the transaction, the Company was entitled to earn out payments based on Novadaqs TMR sales during 2007. During 2007, the Company earned $2.0 million. The gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily represents the Companys share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on the Companys available for sale investments. The investment realized (gains) losses and impairment represents the realized gains and losses, and estimated impairment in the value of the Companys investment in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for further information. The decreases in accounts receivable securitization costs in 2009 and 2008 were due primarily to the Companys termination of its securitization programs in the United States (August 2008) and Japan (February 2009). 33 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were impacted as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense at U.S. federal statutory rate $ 106.5 $ 57.5 $ 52.4 Foreign income tax at different rates (27.9 ) (26.4 ) (21.4 ) Tax credits, federal and state (5.5 ) (3.5 ) (2.8 ) State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 4.9 2.0 3.1 Reserve for uncertain tax positions for prior years (3.8 ) (6.2 ) 1.2 Nondeductible stock based compensation 1.4 0.9 1.9 Deemed dividends, net of foreign tax credit 1.0 0.6 3.2 Valuation allowance for loss on investments 0.6 (0.6 ) Nondeductible goodwill 12.2 Other (1.9 ) (1.6 ) (0.2 ) Income tax provision $ 75.3 $ 35.5 $ 36.8 Reserve for Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $47.1 million and $35.9 million, respectively. These liabilities could be reduced by $3.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. The net amounts of $44.0 million and $33.6 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Unrecognized tax benefits, January 1 $ 35.9 $ 36.4 $ 24.6 Increase prior period tax positions 8.9 12.3 12.1 Decrease prior period tax positions (9.4 ) (19.9 ) (7.9 ) Current year tax positions 15.7 18.0 8.6 Settlements (3.6 ) (10.9 ) (0.9 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (0.4 ) (0.1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, December 31 $ 47.1 $ 35.9 $ 36.4 The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had accrued $2.7 million (net of $0.5 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2008, the Company had accrued $1.9 million (net of $0.5 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. Management 34 Table of Contents believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions. As a result of on going negotiations of Advanced Pricing Agreements between Switzerland and Japan, and Japan and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months. The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change could result in a reduction of as much as $26 million. At December 31, 2009, the Company has concluded all United States federal income tax matters for years through 2006. All material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2003. The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2007 and 2008 tax years. In February 2009, California enacted tax legislation which will be effective beginning 2011. The impact of the new legislation has been considered in determining the Companys tax provision for 2009, including the realizability of its California research and development credit carryforward. Nondeductible Stock based Compensation Some of the Companys stock based compensation costs are not deductible in the United States or in foreign countries. Valuation Allowance for Loss on Investments The Company recorded other than temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are contingent on the Company realizing sufficient capital gains in the appropriate period with which to offset these expected capital losses. Due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain of these impaired investments, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated. As of December 31, 2009, deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately $3.2 million had accumulated related to investments. Of the total valuation allowance of $3.2 million, $0.5 million was recorded as a component of "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss," while $0.6 million was recorded in 2009 through a charge to profit and loss. The remaining $2.1 million had previously been recorded as of December 31, 2008 through charges to profit and loss. During 2007, the Company recognized capital gains on the sale of real estate development rights and a capital loss on the sale of investments. As a result, the Company reversed valuation allowances of $0.6 million due to adequate capital gains to offset capital losses. Nondeductible Goodwill During 2008, the Company completed the sale of certain assets related to the LifeStent product line. A $34.6 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line was recorded. This amount is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 by $0.66, $0.59 and $0.50, respectively. The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide the Companys manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2013, 2017, 2019 and indefinitely, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to 35 Table of Contents fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The Company is not currently experiencing any limitation on access to its credit facility as a result of the conditions in global financial markets. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all. The Company has a Five Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement") which matures on September 29, 2011. The Credit Agreement provides up to an aggregate of $500.0 million in one to six month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.40%, which includes a facility fee subject to adjustment for leverage ratio changes, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company pays a facility fee regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.075%. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement have been classified as long term obligations, as these borrowings are expected to be refinanced pursuant to the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2009, borrowings of $90.3 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2009. The Company previously securitized, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of trade accounts receivable in the United States and Japan. In August 2008, the Company terminated its securitization program in the United States, and repurchased $50.0 million of accounts receivable. In February 2009, the Company terminated its securitization program in Japan and paid $39.0 million for the outstanding accounts receivable and February collections. The securitization programs no longer offered an attractive financing alternative. In December 2007, the Company received notification that the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund in which the Company had invested $50.1 million as of December 31, 2007, was being closed to new subscriptions or redemptions, resulting in the Companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys investment in this fund had been fully liquidated. In September 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $55.9 million, and may receive up to an additional $9.0 million upon the buyers achievement of certain revenue objectives over the next two years. In January 2008, the Company sold certain assets related to the Edwards LifeStent peripheral vascular product line. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received an initial cash payment of $74.0 million at closing, and was entitled to receive up to an additional $65.0 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones. In December 2008, the Company recorded a gain of $23.0 million for the receipt of a LifeStent milestone payment in connection with the transfer of its pre market approval to the buyer. In February 2009, the Company received an additional $27.0 million milestone payment associated with the LifeStent pre market approval. The remaining $15.0 million milestone was earned and recorded in September 2009 upon the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing to the buyer. In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to $250.0 million of the Companys common stock. During 2009, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $95.5 million and as of December 31, 2009 had remaining authority under the July 2008 program to purchase $98.0 million of common stock. In February 2010, the Company approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to an additional $500.0 million of the Companys common stock. Stock repurchased under these programs has been used primarily to offset obligations under the Companys employee stock option programs and reduce the total shares outstanding. 36 Table of Contents Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $165.3 million for 2009 increased $12.1 million from 2008 primarily due to a $50.0 million cash payment during 2008 to terminate the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in the United States, compared to a $39.0 million cash payment during 2009 to terminate the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in Japan. In addition, 2009 operating cash flow was positively impacted by higher operating profits and lower tax payments, offset by net cash outflows resulting from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2009. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $153.2 million for 2008 decreased $59.9 million from 2007 primarily due to a $50.0 million cash payment during 2008 to terminate the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in the United States. In addition, 2008 operating cash flow was negatively impacted by net cash outflows from the Japan accounts receivable securitization program, partially offset by net cash inflows resulting from higher operating profits and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities of $40.1 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $55.9 million of cash received from the sale of the hemofiltration product line, $42.0 million of cash received for milestone achievements associated with the LifeStent pre market approval, and $11.4 million in cash redemptions associated with the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, partially offset by capital expenditures of $64.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities of $58.8 million in 2008 consisted primarily of $97.0 million of cash received from the sale of the LifeStent product line and a related milestone achievement, and $35.5 million in cash redemptions associated with the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, partially offset by capital expenditures of $50.6 million and a $27.4 million purchase of intangible assets, primarily due to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property. Net cash used in financing activities of $91.8 million in 2009 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $95.5 million and net payments on long term debt of $84.6 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $66.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $134.1 million in 2008 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $306.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from long term debt of $94.2 million and the proceeds from stock plans of $63.8 million. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009 were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt $ 90.3 $ $ 90.3 $ $ Interest on long term debt 1.0 0.6 0.4 Operating leases 74.7 16.1 21.2 12.4 25.0 Pension obligation(a) 4.7 4.7 Contractual development obligations(b) 31.9 9.6 17.5 4.8 Capital commitment obligations(c) 3.5 2.0 1.5 Total contractual cash obligations(d) $ 206.1 $ 33.0 $ 130.9 $ 17.2 $ 25.0 (a)The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to the Companys various pension plans. Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. The total accrued benefit liability for the Companys pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2009 was $25.7 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets. Therefore, the Company is unable 37 Table of Contents to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. See Note 11 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information. (b)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones. (c)Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees. These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made. (d)As of December 31, 2009, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $50.3 million. As a result of on going negotiations of Advanced Pricing Agreements between Switzerland and Japan, and Japan and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months. The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change could result in a reduction of as much as $26 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Companys accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Companys transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions. Management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies. Management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, income taxes, any impairments of assets, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. 38 Table of Contents The Companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances. These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted. The Companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on third party data, as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations. The Companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Companys United States distributors and represents the difference between the Companys sales price to the distributor (at the Companys distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer. This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor. The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from the largest distributors. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated. The Company also offers volume rebates to certain GPOs and customers based upon target sales levels. These volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO. The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid. The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated. Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. An allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $12.4 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. A write down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply). The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $16.0 million and $13.2 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Patent Costs The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks. These 39 Table of Contents capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark. Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes a two step goodwill impairment test. The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term, strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development. Certain of these investments are designated as available for sale. These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss." Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investees outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded at the amount of the Companys investment and adjusted each period for the Companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid. As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value. When the fair value of an available for sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a recognized loss: the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investees performance against product development milestones; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 40  Table of Contents Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Stock based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values. Stock based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions. The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, and expected option term. Stock based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be impacted. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches, including market, income and or cost approaches, and considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company prioritizes the inputs used to determine fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 41 Table of Contents When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets or liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, the Company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement. The Company has procedures to independently verify and test valuations received from third parties. The financial assets and liabilities that the Company records at fair value include investments in marketable securities, residual interests in securitizations and derivative instruments. Investments in Marketable Securities Investments Held for the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan The Company holds investments in trading securities related to its executive deferred compensation plan. The fair values of the securities are based on quoted market prices and are categorized as Level 1. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Certain of the Companys investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as available for sale. These investments are carried at fair market value based on quoted market prices and are categorized as Level 1. Derivative Instruments The Company uses forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to forecasted intercompany and third party foreign currency transactions. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. The fair value for derivatives is determined based on indicative mid market data levels for spot rate and forward points as of the close of business on December 31, 2009. All values are discounted to present from the expiry date. The values of options are calculated based on the forward implied volatilities to the expiry date. The models used for valuations are based upon well recognized financial principles, and the predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources. Although readily observable data is used in the valuations, different valuation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair value. The derivative instruments are categorized as Level 2. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs"). This accounting guidance eliminates the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities and establishes a new approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on whether the entity (a) has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (b) has the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary, and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. Enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about an enterprises involvement in a VIE. The guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," to require companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on estimated selling price in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for the deliverables. ASC Topic 605 was also amended to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements 42 Table of Contents must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that have already been delivered. The guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," to require companies to (a) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for such transfers and (b) present separately in the Level 3 reconciliation information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. The amendment also clarifies existing guidance on the level of disaggregation to present and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk, opportunity and costs. Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The derivative instruments used include option based products and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $343.1 million and $225.1 million, respectively. The notional amounts of option based products and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the Companys exposure through its use of derivatives. Interest Rate Risk As part of its overall risk management program, the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 15 basis point increase in interest rates (approximately 10% of the Companys weighted average interest rate) affecting the Companys financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments, would have an immaterial effect on the Companys annual interest expense. Currency Risk The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese yen and the Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net United States dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of 43 Table of Contents these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option based products consist of purchased put options and, at times, written (sold) call options to create collars. Option based products are agreements that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels. As part of its risk management process, the Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, with a 95 percent confidence level and a 14 day holding period, to estimate this potential loss. The Companys calculated VAR at December 31, 2009 and 2008 with a maturity of up to one year, was $4.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. This amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Companys calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future. Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default, and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counterparty diversification, monitoring of counterparty financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2009 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2009, all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "A" or better by national rating agencies. The Company does not anticipate non performance by its counterparties and has no reserves related to non performance as of December 31, 2009. The Company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in April 2000. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses. In 2009, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net. 44 Table of Contents Investment Risk Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies. These investments are classified in "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2009, Edwards Lifesciences had $22.3 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized losses of $1.0 million on these investments in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss," net of tax. Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary. 45  Table of Contents
