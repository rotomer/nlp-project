Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2010. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences financial position as of December 31, 2010. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is a global leader in products and technologies designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. The Company is focused specifically on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients. The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences are categorized into four main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; and Vascular. Edwards Lifesciences Heart Valve Therapy portfolio is comprised of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products. A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the worlds leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve. In the Critical Care area, Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients cardiovascular function, and in disposable pressure transducers. Prior to September 2009, Edwards Lifesciences provided products for continuous renal replacement therapy ("hemofiltration product line"). The Company sold the hemofiltration 22 Table of Contents product line in September 2009. The Companys Cardiac Surgery Systems portfolio comprises a diverse line of products for use during cardiac surgery, including cannulae, embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Cardiac Surgery Systems also includes the Companys minimally invasive surgery ("MIS") product line. Edwards Lifesciences Vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter based products, surgical clips and inserts, and artificial implantable grafts. Edwards Lifesciences manufactured and sold LifeStent balloon expandable and self expanding non coronary stents until the sale of this product line in January 2008. The Company continued to manufacture these products for the buyer until September 2009 when manufacturing was transferred to the buyer. The healthcare marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors. The Company competes with many companies, ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than Edwards Lifesciences with access to significant financial resources. Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the Company competes. Global demand for healthcare is increasing as the population ages. There is mounting pressure to contain healthcare costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures. The cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic, and technology, cost of care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change. In March 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States. The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. The excise tax will increase the Companys operating expenses. The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Companys products, and impact the demand for the Companys products or the prices at which the Company sells its products. On April 12, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend, paid on May 27, 2010 to shareholders of record on May 14, 2010. The Company distributed its treasury shares in addition to newly issued shares to effect the stock split. All applicable share and per share amounts in this "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this stock split. Results of Operations Net Sales by Major Regions (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 United States $ 567.6 $ 556.1 $ 543.6 $ 11.5 $ 12.5 2.1 % 2.3 % Europe 457.0 404.6 380.3 52.4 24.3 13.0 % 6.4 % Japan 247.8 214.1 176.5 33.7 37.6 15.7 % 21.3 % Rest of World 174.6 146.6 137.3 28.0 9.3 19.1 % 6.8 % International 879.4 765.3 694.1 114.1 71.2 14.9 % 10.3 % Total net sales $ 1,447.0 $ 1,321.4 $ 1,237.7 $ 125.6 $ 83.7 9.5 % 6.8 % 23 Table of Contents The $11.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2010 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $9.7 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Aortic Ease valve (launched in the second quarter of 2009), Magna Mitral Ease valve (launched in the third quarter of 2010), Physio II ring (launched in the first quarter of 2009), and sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve for clinical trials; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $5.7 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system; and Cardiac Surgery Systems products, which increased net sales by $2.7 million, driven primarily by the MIS product line; partially offset by: the discontinuance of manufacturing in September 2009 of the divested LifeStent product line, which decreased net sales by $8.2 million. The $114.1 million increase in international net sales in 2010 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $112.6 million, driven primarily by the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve, the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve and the new Carpentier Edwards Physio II ring, which was launched in Europe in the first quarter of 2009 and in Japan in the first quarter of 2010; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $18.1 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system and pressure monitoring products; Cardiac Surgery Systems products, which increased net sales by $4.1 million, driven primarily by specialty cannula products; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $8.6 million, due to the strengthening of various currencies against the United States dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar; partially offset by: hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $32.0 million. The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009. For more information see "Special Charges (Gains), net." The $12.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2009 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $33.6 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve, Magna with ThermaFix valve, and the Physio II ring; partially offset by: the divestiture of the LifeStent product line in mid January 2008, which decreased net sales by $23.2 million. LifeStent sales after the divestiture resulted from the on going manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement, which continued until the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer in September 2009. The $71.2 million increase in international net sales in 2009 was due primarily to: Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $80.0 million, driven primarily by the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve and the Magna aortic valve in Japan; and 24 Table of Contents Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $19.6 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system and pressure monitoring products; partially offset by: foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $15.2 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar; and hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $10.6 million. The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Companys hedging activities. For more information see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Net Sales by Product Line (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change Percent Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 Heart Valve Therapy $ 838.3 $ 714.9 $ 607.4 $ 123.4 $ 107.5 17.3 % 17.7 % Critical Care 454.1 452.5 451.8 1.6 0.7 0.4 % 0.2 % Cardiac Surgery Systems 100.2 92.8 89.2 7.4 3.6 8.0 % 4.0 % Vascular 54.4 61.2 89.3 (6.8 ) (28.1 ) (11.1 )% (31.5 )% Total net sales $ 1,447.0 $ 1,321.4 $ 1,237.7 $ 125.6 $ 83.7 9.5 % 6.8 % Heart Valve Therapy The $123.4 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2010 was due primarily to: the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve, which increased net sales by $99.0 million; and pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $26.2 million, primarily as a result of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Aortic Ease valve. The $107.5 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2009 was due primarily to: the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, which increased net sales by $59.5 million; pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $41.7 million, primarily as a result of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve, the Magna with ThermaFix mitral valve and the Magna aortic valve in Japan; and the launch of the Carpentier Edwards Physio II ring in the first quarter of 2009, which increased net sales by $12.0 million; partially offset by: foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $8.6 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar. The Company expects that its SAPIEN and SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valves will continue to be strong contributors to 2011 sales. The Company also expects that sales of its other new products will 25 Table of Contents continue to drive surgical heart valve growth in 2011. The Company launched its Magna Mitral Ease valve in the United States and Europe during the third quarter of 2010, and expects to obtain approval in Japan during the fourth quarter of 2011. The Magna Mitral Ease extends the Magna platform and is intended to provide improved MIS capabilities and ease of implantation. In January 2010, the Company completed first in human procedures and initiated a clinical feasibility study in Europe, called TRITON, for a novel minimally invasive aortic valve surgery system, called INTUITY (formerly Project Odyssey). The INTUITY Valve System leverages the design of the Carpentier Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease tissue heart valve to create a new valve platform with an innovative delivery and attachment system. It is designed to enable a faster procedure, shorter patient time on cardiopulmonary bypass and a smaller incision. In April 2010, the Company expanded the study into a CE Mark trial. The Company completed enrollment in TRITON during the third quarter of 2010, and anticipates receiving CE Mark in mid 2011. In the United States, the Company expects to obtain Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") approval for the clinical trial of the INTUITY Valve System during 2011. During the second quarter of 2011, the Company expects to launch the Carpentier Edwards Physio Tricuspid annuloplasty ring in the United States and Europe. This new ring expands the Companys market leading repair portfolio and is designed to provide a more physiologic repair for a patients tricuspid valve. Critical Care The $1.6 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2010 was due primarily to: premium products, led by FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $14.2 million, and PreSep, the Companys continuous central venous oximetry catheter for early detection of sepsis, which increased net sales by $3.3 million; pressure monitoring products, which increased net sales by $8.5 million; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $8.7 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar; partially offset by: hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $32.3 million. The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009. The $0.7 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2009 was due primarily to: FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $14.2 million; and core Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $4.3 million, driven primarily by pressure monitoring products; partially offset by: hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $13.6 million. The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $4.1 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company launched, outside of the United States, a substantial upgrade designed to strengthen the FloTrac systems applicability in the medical intensive care unit and a new hardware platform with a simpler, more intuitive informational display. The Company expects to obtain approval for these products in the United States in the third quarter of 2011. 26 Table of Contents In September 2010, the Company entered into a collaboration, license, and supply agreement related to its Central Venous Access product line ("Access Products"). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company granted the buyer an exclusive, perpetual, royalty free license to manufacture, distribute, market and sell the Access Products in the United States. The Company agreed to manufacture and exclusively supply the Access Products to the buyer through March 2013. The Company has a collaboration agreement with DexCom, Inc. ("DexCom") to develop products for continuously monitoring blood glucose levels in patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions. In Europe, the Company received CE Mark in the fourth quarter of 2009 and has made progress on the development of a second generation product designed to enhance ease of use. The Company anticipates obtaining CE Mark on the second generation product by the end of 2011 and plans to begin commercial sales in 2012. Cardiac Surgery Systems The $7.4 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2010 was due primarily to MIS products, which increased net sales by $3.7 million, and specialty cannula products, which increased net sales by $3.1 million. The $3.6 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2009 was due primarily to MIS products, which increased net sales by $2.8 million. Vascular The $6.8 million and $28.1 million decreases in net sales of Vascular products in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were due primarily to the discontinuance of manufacturing in September 2009 of the divested LifeStent product line. Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 71.8 % 69.8 % 66.1 % 2.0 pts. 3.7 pts. The 2.0 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 was driven by: a 1.5 percentage point increase due to a more profitable international product mix, primarily higher sales of transcatheter heart valves and the divestiture of the hemofiltration product line, and the favorable impact of manufacturing performance; and a 0.5 percentage point increase primarily due to the favorable impact of manufacturing performance in the United States. The 3.7 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2009 was driven by: a 1.5 percentage point increase due primarily to a more profitable product mix in the United States, primarily from reduced sales of LifeStent products under the manufacturing requirements of the LifeStent sale agreement and higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products; a 1.4 percentage point increase due to a more profitable international product mix, primarily higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products and FloTrac systems; and the impact from the outcome of foreign currency hedging contracts. 27 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 SG&A expenses $ 550.0 $ 508.8 $ 480.6 $ 41.2 $ 28.2 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 38.0 % 38.5 % 38.8 % (0.5 ) pts. (0.3 ) pts. The $41.2 million increase in SG&A expenses in 2010 was primarily in Europe due to the following: (1) higher sales and marketing expenses, primarily to support the transcatheter heart valve program and (2) higher sales related spending in the Critical Care and Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product lines. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $2.7 million, primarily due to the strengthening of various currencies against the United States dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar. The $28.2 million increase in SG&A expenses in 2009 was primarily in Europe due to the following: (1) investments for the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve program in Europe and (2) higher sales related spending in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product line. The increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency (primarily the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar) in the amount of $5.4 million. Research and Development Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Research and development expenses $ 204.4 $ 175.5 $ 139.2 $ 28.9 $ 36.3 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales 14.1 % 13.3 % 11.2 % 0.8 pts. 2.1 pts. The increase in research and development expenses in 2010 was due to additional investments in all major product lines, primarily the transcatheter heart valve program. The increase in research and development expenses in 2009 was due primarily to additional investments in the transcatheter heart valve and glucose programs. The following are the developments related to the Companys transcatheter heart valve program: the Company received conditional IDE approval from the FDA in March 2007 to initiate its PARTNER trial, a pivotal clinical trial of the Companys Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve technology. The PARTNER trial, which has two study arms, is evaluating the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in patients who are considered at high risk for conventional open heart valve surgery. In the first study arm ("Cohort A"), patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to either high risk surgery or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. In the second study arm ("Cohort B"), patients who were deemed non operable were randomized 1:1 to medical management or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve. In addition, the Company received FDA approval for non randomized continued access for all of its existing PARTNER sites. During the third quarter of 2010, positive one year data from Cohort B was published and the Company completed the submission of its pre market approval to the FDA during the fourth quarter of 2010. The Company anticipates launching its SAPIEN transcatheter valve in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2011. The Company anticipates submitting its pre market approval for Cohort A to the FDA during the second quarter of 2011; the Company announced it received CE Mark in March 2010 for its next generation transcatheter heart valve, the Edwards SAPIEN XT valve, as well as its NovaFlex transfemoral and Ascendra2 28 Table of Contents transapical delivery systems. The Company believes that this next generation valves features will help reduce its delivery profile without compromising strength, enabling it to better address the requirements of transfemoral delivery. The Company began disciplined European launches of SAPIEN XT with NovaFlex at the end of the first quarter of 2010, and SAPIEN XT with Ascendra2 at the end of the second quarter of 2010; in the United States, the Company submitted an IDE for SAPIEN XT in October 2009. The PARTNER II trial will evaluate SAPIEN XT with both the NovaFlex and Ascendra2 delivery systems and will target high risk patients similar to those studied in the PARTNER trial. The first cohort of the PARTNER II trial ("PARTNER II Cohort B") will study up to 500 inoperable patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis using a 1:1 randomization of SAPIEN XT with the NovaFlex transfemoral delivery system versus SAPIEN with the RetroFlex 3 delivery system. In February 2011, the Company received conditional IDE approval from the FDA for PARTNER II Cohort B. The Company expects to complete enrollment in this cohort by the end of 2011. The second planned patient cohort ("PARTNER II Cohort A") will compare traditional open heart surgery with SAPIEN XT delivered either transfemorally or transapically in high risk surgical patients. The Company anticipates that IDE approval for PARTNER II Cohort A could be received in the first quarter of 2011; in Japan, the Company completed its first compassionate use cases with the SAPIEN valve using both the transapical and transfemoral delivery systems in October 2009. The Company began enrolling patients in a clinical trial with its SAPIEN XT valve, called PREVAIL JAPAN, during the second quarter of 2010. The PREVAIL JAPAN clinical trial will evaluate SAPIEN XT with both the transfemoral and transapical delivery systems. The Company believes that successful trial completion could result in an approval as early as 2013; and during the second quarter of 2010, the Company decided to discontinue its MONARC transcatheter mitral valve program due to slow enrollment in the EVOLUTION II trial. Also, in early analysis of the data, MONARC did not demonstrate a significant efficacy advantage. Special Charges (Gains), net Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) MONARC program discontinuation $ 8.3 $ $ Realignment expenses, net 7.2 (1.7 ) Investment impairment 7.2 1.6 Gain on sale of assets, net (86.9 ) (14.9 ) Charitable fund contribution 15.0 Settlements and litigation, net 3.8 0.6 Adjustment to capitalized patent enforcement costs 3.7 8.2 Reserve reversal (1.0 ) Acquisition of in process technology and intellectual property 19.5 DexCom collaboration agreement 13.4 Total special charges (gains), net $ 22.7 $ (63.8 ) $ 25.1 MONARC Program Discontinuation During the second quarter of 2010, the Company decided to discontinue its MONARC transcatheter mitral valve program due to slow enrollment in the EVOLUTION II trial. As a result, the Company recorded an $8.3 million charge consisting of a $7.6 million impairment of intangible assets associated with the program and $0.7 million of clinical trial costs that will continue to be incurred under a contractual obligation that existed prior to the discontinuation date. 29  Table of Contents Realignment Expenses, net In December 2010, the Company recorded a $7.2 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting 84 employees. As of December 31, 2010, remaining payments of $5.7 million related to the realignment are expected to be paid in 2011. In March 2008, the Company recorded a $1.3 million charge for executive severance associated with the Companys business realignment. As of December 31, 2010, payments related to the executive severance charge were complete. In 2008, the Company reversed $3.0 million of the December 2007 accrued severance related to the sale of the LifeStent product line and global reduction in workforce. Investment Impairment In September and December 2010, the Company recorded a $3.9 million charge and a $3.3 million charge, respectively, related to the other than temporary impairment of certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The Company concluded that the impairment of these investments was other than temporary based upon the continuing duration and severity of the impairment. In September 2009, the Company recorded a $1.6 million charge related to the other than temporary impairment of its investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. The Company concluded that the impairment of its investment was other than temporary based upon (a) the continuing duration and severity of the impairment and (b) positive clinical trial developments in the third quarter of 2009 which failed to raise the quoted market price of the affiliates stock to the Companys carrying value. Gain on Sale of Assets, net In September 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $55.9 million, and would receive up to an additional $9.0 million upon the buyers achievement of certain revenue objectives over the two years following the sale, of which $6.0 million and $2.1 million was earned in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and recorded in "Other (Income) Expense, net." The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $43.6 million consisting of the cash proceeds of $55.9 million, offset by $8.5 million related to the net book value of inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets that were sold, a $0.6 million satisfaction of a receivable, a $0.5 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line and $2.7 million of transaction and other costs related to the sale. In connection with this transaction, the Company also recorded a $1.5 million charge in June 2009 for transaction costs and employee severance. In March 2009, the Company recorded a $2.8 million gain related to the sale of its distribution rights in Europe for a specialty vascular graft. In January 2008, the Company sold certain assets related to the Edwards LifeStent peripheral vascular product line. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received an initial cash payment of $74.0 million at closing, and was entitled to receive up to an additional $65.0 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones. In addition, the Company agreed to provide transition services until the earlier of mid 2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer. In December 2008, the Company received a $23.0 million LifeStent milestone payment in connection with the transfer of its pre market approval to the buyer. In February 2009, the Company received an additional $27.0 million milestone payment associated with the LifeStent pre market approval. In September 2009, the Company earned the remaining $15.0 million milestone payment upon the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing to the buyer. In connection with the LifeStent transaction, the Company recorded in January 2008 a pre tax loss of $8.1 million consisting of the cash proceeds of $74.0 million, offset by a $34.6 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line, $36.9 million related to the net book value of inventory, fixed assets and 30 Table of Contents intangible assets that were sold, $6.9 million of deferred revenue related to the transition services the Company agreed to provide and $3.7 million of transaction and other costs related to the sale. Charitable Fund Contribution In September 2009, the Company contributed $15.0 million to The Edwards Lifesciences Fund, a donor advised fund intended to provide philanthropic support to cardiovascular and community related charitable causes. The contribution was an irrevocable contribution to a third party, and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment. Settlements and Litigation, net In September 2009, the Company recorded a $3.8 million charge for litigation related to a royalty dispute in connection with a product in the Companys Cardiac Surgery Systems product line. In December 2008, the Company recorded a $1.5 million insurance settlement gain related to a fire that occurred in the third quarter of 2007 which damaged certain inventory held at a third party warehouse in Brazil. In March 2008, the Company recorded a $2.1 million charge for the settlement of litigation related to its divested United States perfusion services business. Under the terms of the divestiture, this was the Companys last outstanding case. Adjustment to Capitalized Patent Enforcement Costs In December 2009, the Company recorded a $3.7 million charge for the write off of capitalized patent enforcement costs related to litigation in Europe for which success was no longer deemed probable. In December 2008, the Company recorded an $8.2 million charge due primarily to the reversal of capitalized patent enforcement costs for a litigated claim related to patents in a product area where the Company did not then, and does not currently, compete and where the related patent enforcement costs, therefore, should be expensed as incurred. The Company recorded the correction of this error in the fourth quarter of 2008. Approximately $5.7 million of the charge related to 2007 and 2006, and $2.5 million related to the first, second and third quarters of 2008. The Company concluded that the out of period amounts were not material to any of the prior years financial statements, and the impact of the correcting adjustment was not material to the full year 2008 financial statements. Reserve Reversal In 2004, the Company discontinued its Lifepath AAA endovascular graft program. In March 2009, upon completion of its remaining clinical obligations related to this program, the Company reversed its remaining $1.0 million clinical reserve. Acquisition of In Process Technology and Intellectual Property In October 2008, the Company recorded a $5.0 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property. The acquired technology is being developed for use in restoring heart geometry and function and offers a reshaping solution for patients who suffer from debilitating functional mitral regurgitation. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. In November 2008, the Company recorded a $13.2 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property, primarily related to a product which is currently under development, and certain tangible assets, including prototypes and equipment used in the development of the product. The acquired technology is being developed for use in hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring. Additional design 31 Table of Contents developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company must pay an additional &euro;3.0 million (US$3.9 million) milestone payment should the Company achieve net sales of the product in Europe of &euro;6.4 million (US$8.4 million) in any four consecutive quarters in the first five years following market launch in Europe. In December 2008, the Company recorded a $1.3 million charge related to the acquisition of technology and intellectual property related to a device for the reduction or elimination of mitral regurgitation and the control of left ventricular dilation. Additional design developments, bench testing, pre clinical studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. DexCom Collaboration Agreement In November 2008, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with DexCom to develop products for automated, real time monitoring of blood glucose levels in patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions. The agreement provides Edwards Lifesciences with an exclusive license to DexComs applicable intellectual property. The Company recorded a charge of $13.4 million related to the upfront licensing and collaboration fee. Interest Expense Interest expense was $2.4 million, $2.7 million and $7.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $0.3 million decrease in interest expense for 2010 resulted primarily from prior year interest expense related to a sales and use tax audit settlement, partially offset by a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year. The $4.5 million decrease in interest expense for 2009 resulted primarily from lower interest rates and a lower average debt balance as compared to the prior year. Interest Income Interest income was $0.9 million, $1.6 million and $6.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $0.7 million decrease in interest income for 2010 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher cash and short term investment balances. The $4.5 million decrease in interest income for 2009 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates. Other (Income) Expense, net Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Earn out payments $ (6.0 ) $ (2.1 ) $ Gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates (0.8 ) (1.2 ) (2.0 ) Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net (0.2 ) (2.3 ) 7.2 Investment realized (gains) losses and impairment (0.5 ) 3.0 Accounts receivable securitization costs 1.6 Other (1.1 ) 2.4 (2.1 ) Total other (income) expense, net $ (8.1 ) $ (3.7 ) $ 7.7 In September 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line. In connection with the transaction, the Company is entitled to earn out payments up to $9.0 million based on certain revenue objectives to be achieved by the buyer over the two years following the sale. 32 Table of Contents The gain on investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily represents the Companys share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on the Companys available for sale investments. The foreign exchange (gains) losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations in the Companys global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances. Foreign exchange fluctuations (primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen) resulted in a net gain in 2010. The investment realized (gains) losses and impairment represents the realized gains and losses, and estimated impairment, in the value of the Companys investment in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund. The decrease in accounts receivable securitization costs was due to the Companys termination of its securitization programs in the United States (August 2008) and Japan (February 2009). Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were impacted as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense at U.S. federal statutory rate $ 93.9 $ 106.5 $ 57.5 Foreign income tax at different rates (28.1 ) (27.9 ) (26.4 ) Release of reserve for uncertain tax positions for prior years (13.4 ) (3.8 ) (6.2 ) Tax credits, federal and state (7.8 ) (5.5 ) (3.5 ) State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 4.1 4.9 2.0 U.S. tax on foreign earnings, net of credits 2.2 1.0 0.6 Nondeductible stock based compensation 1.9 1.4 0.9 Nondeductible goodwill 12.2 Other (2.6 ) (1.3 ) (1.6 ) Income tax provision $ 50.2 $ 75.3 $ 35.5 Reserve for Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $55.1 million and $47.1 million, respectively. These liabilities could be reduced by $4.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. The net amounts of $50.4 million and $44.0 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. 33 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Unrecognized tax benefits, January 1 $ 47.1 $ 35.9 $ 36.4 Increase prior period tax positions 8.6 8.9 12.3 Decrease prior period tax positions (20.1 ) (9.4 ) (19.9 ) Current year tax positions 20.8 15.7 18.0 Settlements (0.1 ) (3.6 ) (10.9 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (1.2 ) (0.4 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, December 31 $ 55.1 $ 47.1 $ 35.9 The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had accrued $1.7 million (net of $1.4 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2009, the Company had accrued $2.7 million (net of $0.5 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions. The federal research credit was reinstated as of December 31, 2010. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 has been calculated with the benefit for the federal research credit. The federal research credit favorably impacted the effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions. As a result of on going negotiations of Advanced Pricing Agreements between Switzerland and the United States and between Japan and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months. The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material. At December 31, 2010, all material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2005. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of the Companys 2007 and 2008 tax years for all matters except for certain transfer pricing issues. The Company has entered the appeals process for those transfer pricing issues. In February 2009, California enacted tax legislation which will be effective beginning 2011. The impact of the new legislation has been considered in determining the Companys tax provision for 2010, including the realizability of its California research and development credit carryforward. Nondeductible Stock based Compensation Some of the Companys stock based compensation costs are not deductible in the United States or in foreign countries. 34 Table of Contents Valuation Allowance for Loss on Investments The Company recorded other than temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are contingent on the Company realizing sufficient capital gains in the appropriate period with which to offset these expected capital losses. Due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain of these impaired investments, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated. As of December 31, 2010, deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately $3.1 million had accumulated related to investments. Of the total valuation allowance of $3.1 million, $0.4 million was recorded in 2010 through a charge to profit and loss. The remaining $2.7 million had previously been recorded as of December 31, 2009 through charges to profit and loss. Nondeductible Goodwill During 2008, the Company completed the sale of certain assets related to the LifeStent product line. A $34.6 million write off of goodwill associated with this product line was recorded. The Company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 by $0.34, $0.31 and $0.28, respectively. The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide the Companys manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2013, 2017, 2019 and indefinitely, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all. As of December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States was approximately $367.0 million, and has historically been used to fund international operations. The Company believes that cash and cash equivalents held in the United States, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, is sufficient to fund its United States operating requirements. Cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States can be repatriated back to the United States, if needed. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. The Company has a Five Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement"), which matures on September 29, 2011. The Credit Agreement provides up to an aggregate of $500.0 million in one to six month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.40%, which includes a facility fee subject to adjustment for leverage ratio changes, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company pays a facility fee regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.075%. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement have been classified as short term obligations as these obligations are due within one year. The Company anticipates that it will extend or replace the Credit Agreement upon maturity. However, no assurances can be given that the Credit Agreement will be extended or replaced on comparable terms as those currently in place. As of December 31, 2010, borrowings of $41.8 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2010. 35 Table of Contents The Company previously securitized, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of trade accounts receivable in the United States and Japan. In August 2008, the Company terminated its securitization program in the United States and repurchased $50.0 million of accounts receivable. In February 2009, the Company terminated its securitization program in Japan and paid $39.0 million for the outstanding accounts receivable and February collections. The securitization programs no longer offered an attractive financing alternative. In September 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $55.9 million, and would receive up to an additional $9.0 million upon the buyers achievement of certain revenue objectives over the two years following the sale, $6.6 million of which had been received as of December 31, 2010. In January 2008, the Company sold certain assets related to the Edwards LifeStent peripheral vascular product line. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received an initial cash payment of $74.0 million at closing, and was entitled to receive up to an additional $65.0 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones. In December 2008, the Company recorded a gain of $23.0 million for the receipt of a LifeStent milestone payment in connection with the transfer of its pre market approval to the buyer. In February 2009, the Company received an additional $27.0 million milestone payment associated with the LifeStent pre market approval. The remaining $15.0 million milestone was earned and received in 2009 upon the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing to the buyer. In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to $250.0 million of the Companys common stock. In February 2010, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to an additional $500.0 million of the Companys common stock. Stock repurchased under these programs has been used primarily to offset obligations under the Companys employee stock incentive programs and reduce the total shares outstanding. During 2010, the Company repurchased 4.1 million shares (as adjusted to reflect the May 2010 two for one stock split) at an aggregate cost of $200.0 million and has remaining authority under the February 2010 program to purchase $398.0 million of the Companys common stock. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $251.4 million for 2010 increased $86.1 million from 2009 primarily due to (1) a $39.0 million cash payment during 2009 to terminate the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in Japan, (2) lower supplier payments in 2010 compared to 2009 and (3) higher operating profits. These increases were partially offset by higher inventory purchases in 2010, primarily related to the transcatheter heart valve product line, and the negative impact from increased excess tax benefits from stock plans due to the appreciation in the Companys stock price and increased exercises (which is offset in financing activities). Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $165.3 million for 2009 increased $12.1 million from 2008 primarily due to a $50.0 million cash payment during 2008 to terminate the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in the United States, compared to a $39.0 million cash payment during 2009 to terminate the Companys accounts receivable securitization program in Japan. In addition, 2009 operating cash flow was positively impacted by higher operating profits and lower tax payments, offset by net cash outflows resulting from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2009. Net cash used in investing activities of $61.5 million in 2010 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $61.8 million. Net cash provided by investing activities of $40.1 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $55.9 million of cash received from the sale of the hemofiltration product line, $42.0 million of cash received for milestone achievements associated with the LifeStent pre market approval, and $11.4 million in cash redemptions associated with the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, partially offset by capital expenditures of $64.0 million. 36 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities of $103.9 million in 2010 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $200.0 million and net payments on debt of $48.4 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $92.1 million and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $55.1 million, which increased compared to the prior year due to the appreciation in the Companys stock price and increased exercises. Net cash used in financing activities of $91.8 million in 2009 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $95.5 million and net payments on debt of $84.6 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $66.7 million and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $20.6 million. A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010 were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Debt $ 41.8 $ 41.8 $ $ $ Interest on debt 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 77.3 15.9 20.4 12.1 28.9 Pension obligation(a) 5.7 5.7 Contractual development obligations(b) 13.2 8.0 1.3 3.9 Capital commitment obligations(c) 4.6 3.8 0.6 0.2 Total contractual cash obligations(d) $ 142.9 $ 75.5 $ 22.3 $ 16.2 $ 28.9 (a)The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to the Companys various pension plans. Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. The total accrued benefit liability for the Companys pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2010 was $33.4 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets. Therefore, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. See Note 10 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information. (b)Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones. (c)Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees. These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made. (d)As of December 31, 2010, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $58.2 million. As a result of on going negotiations of Advanced Pricing Agreements between Switzerland and the United States and between Japan and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months. The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Companys accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally 37 Table of Contents Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Companys transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions. The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, income taxes, impairments of assets, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances. These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted. The Companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Companys United States distributors and represents the difference between the Companys sales price to the distributor (at the Companys distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer. This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor. The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributors inventory. This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated. The Company also offers volume rebates to certain GPOs and customers based upon target sales levels. For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO. For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and 38 Table of Contents accounts receivable. The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid. The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.6 million and $12.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. A write down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply). The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $11.2 million and $10.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Patent Costs The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks. These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark. Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes a two step goodwill impairment test. The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Companys market capitalization and a market revenue multiple. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. 39  Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development. Certain of these investments are designated as available for sale. These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss." Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investees outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded at the amount of the Companys investment and adjusted each period for the Companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid. As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value. When the fair value of an available for sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a recognized loss: the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investees performance against product development milestones; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as 40 Table of Contents lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions. As a result of on going negotiations of various Advanced Pricing Agreements, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months. The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material. The Company has significant California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods. The credits may be carried forward indefinitely. Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects all California research expenditure tax credits to be fully utilized; accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided. Stock based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values. Stock based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions. The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, and expected option term. Stock based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be impacted. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition to require companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on estimated selling price in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for the deliverables. The guidance was also amended to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that have already been delivered. The guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on fair value disclosures to require companies to (a) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for such transfers and (b) present separately in the Level 3 reconciliation information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. The guidance also clarifies the level of disaggregation to present and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. The guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those years. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010, other than those provisions related to the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation. In April 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition to provide guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions. Consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the 41 Table of Contents milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive. The guidance is effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company manages these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments. The Company uses forward currency exchange contracts and option based products to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Historically, the Company has used interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk In addition to available cash and cash from operations, the Company uses short and long term debt to finance business activities. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt obligations. The Company is not currently using derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk since the risk is not considered significant. A hypothetical 10% increase in the Companys weighted average interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to outstanding debt obligations, see Note 8 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements." Currency Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of the Companys non United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, gains and losses related to intercompany and third party transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans. The Companys principal currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen and the Euro. The Companys objective is to minimize the volatility of its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options. The Company does not hedge its exposure related to its net investments in its non United States subsidiaries. The total notional amounts of the Companys derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $539.2 million and $343.1 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $44.4 million and $49.5 million, respectively. Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions and would not be significant to the Companys financial condition or results of operations. For more information related to outstanding foreign exchange contracts, see Notes 2 and 9 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements." Credit Risk Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default. It is the Companys policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy. At December 31, 2010, all derivative financial instruments were with banks assigned investment grade ratings of "A" or better by national rating agencies. The Company 42 Table of Contents further diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. The Company also uses International Swap Dealers Association master netting agreements with all derivative counterparties. The master netting agreements reduce the Companys counterparty settlement risk to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between the Company and the counterparty financial institutions. The Company has not experienced a counterparty default and does not anticipate any non performance by the Companys current derivative counterparties. Concentrations of Credit Risk In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses. In 2010, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net. Investment Risk Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies. These investments are classified in "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2010, Edwards Lifesciences had $25.0 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $2.2 million on these investments in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss," net of tax. In 2010, the Company reclassified to earnings a $4.0 million loss, before tax, recorded in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss." The amount reclassified related primarily to the other than temporary impairment of two non strategic investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary. 43  Table of Contents
