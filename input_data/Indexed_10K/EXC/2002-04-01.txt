ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXELON The information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Exhibit 99 2 to Exelons Current Report on Form 8 K dated February 28, 2002. COMED GENERAL On October 20, 2000, ComEd became a 99.9% owned subsidiary of Exelon as a result of the transactions relating to the Merger. As a result of the Merger, ComEds consolidated financial information for the period after the Merger has a different cost basis than that of previous periods. Material variances caused by the different cost basis have been disclosed where applicable. Through December 31, 2000, ComEd operated as a vertically integrated electric utility. During January 2001, Exelon undertook a restructuring to separate its generation and other competitive businesses from its regulated energy delivery business. As part of the restructuring, the non regulated operations and related assets and liabilities of ComEd were transferred to separate subsidiaries of Exelon. As a result, beginning January 2001, the operations of ComEd consist of its retail electricity distribution and transmission business in northern Illinois. The restructuring has had a significant impact on all components of ComEds results of operations. The estimated impact of the restructuring set forth herein reflects the effects of removing the operations related to ComEds nuclear generating stations and obtaining energy and capacity from Generation under the terms of the PPA for the year ended December 31, 2000. 48 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION COMED Components of Variance Restructuring Normal (in millions) 2001 2000 Impact Operations Total Operating Revenues $ 6,206 $ 7,012 $ (707) $ (99) $ (806) Fuel and Purchased Power 2,670 1,977 677 16 693 Operating and Maintenance 981 2,076 (1,072) (23) (1,095) Merger Related Costs 67 (67) (67) Depreciation and Amortization 665 998 (282) (51) (333) Taxes Other Than Income 296 508 (131) (81) (212) Total Operating Expenses 4,612 5,626 (808) (206) (1,014) Operating Income 1,594 1,386 101 107 208 Interest Expense (565) (596) 43 (12) 31 Distributions on Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely the Companys Subordinated Debt Securities (30) (30) Other, Net 114 308 (194) (194) Income Before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Items 1,113 1,068 144 (99) 45 Income Taxes 506 332 72 102 174 Net Income Before Extraordinary Items 607 736 72 (201) (129) Extraordinary Items (net of income taxes) (4) 4 4 Net Income 607 732 72 (197) (125) Preferred and Preference Stock Dividends (3) 3 3 Net Income on Common Stock $ 607 $ 729 $ 72 $ (194) $ (122) NET INCOME Net income from normal operations decreased $197 million, or 25% in 2001. Net income was impacted by $107 million in increased operating income offset by a higher effective tax rate and a $194 million decrease in other income and deductions primarily attributable to a gain on the forward share purchase arrangement recognized during 2000 and a reduction in intercompany interest income in 2001 as compared to 2000. 49 OPERATING REVENUES Bundled service reflects deliveries to customers taking electric service under tariffed rates, which include the cost of energy and the delivery cost of the transmission and distribution of the energy. Unbundled service reflects customers electing to receive electric generation service from the PPO or an ARES. Revenue from customers choosing the PPO includes an energy charge at market rates, transmission and distribution charges and a CTC charge. Revenue from customers choosing an ARES includes a distribution charge and a CTC charge. Transmission charges received from ARES are included in wholesale and miscellaneous revenue.

ComEd non residential customers have the choice to purchase energy from other suppliers. This choice generally does not impact MWh deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to energy supplied by ComEd. The decrease in revenues reflects customers in Illinois electing to purchase energy from an ARES or the PPO. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 18,700 retail customers, representing 22% of total annual retail deliveries, had elected to purchase energy from the PPO or an ARES, compared to approximately 9,500 customers, representing 17% of total annual retail deliveries, as of December 31, 2000. o Weather. The demand for electricity and gas services is impacted by weather conditions. Very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months is referred to as "favorable weather conditions", because these weather conditions result in increased demand for electricity. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. Although weather was moderate in 2001, the weather impact was favorable compared to the prior year as a result of warmer summer weather offset in part by warmer winter weather in 2001. Cooling degree days increased 11% in 2001 compared to 2000 while heating degree days decreased 5% in 2001 compared to 2000. o Revenue taxes. The change in revenue taxes represents a change in presentation of certain revenue taxes from operating revenue and tax expense to collections recorded as liabilities resulting from Illinois legislation. This change in presentation does not affect results of operations. o Other Effects. A strong housing construction market in Chicago has contributed to residential and small commercial and industrial customer volume growth, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a slower economy on large commercial and industrial customers. o Rate Changes. The decrease in revenues attributable to rate changes reflects a 5% residential rate reduction, effective October 1, 2001, required by the Illinois restructuring legislation. The reduction in Wholesale and Miscellaneous revenues in 2001 as compared to 2000, as if the restructuring occurred on January 1, 2000, reflects a $101 million reduction in off system sales due to the expiration of wholesale contracts that were offered by ComEd from June 2000 to May 2001 to support the open access program in Illinois, partially offset by a $58 million increase in transmission service revenue and the reversal of a $15 million reserve for revenue refunds to ComEds municipal customers as a result of a favorable FERC ruling. FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER EXPENSE Fuel and purchased power expense increased $16 million, or 1%, compared to 2000, excluding the effects of restructuring. The increase in fuel and purchased power expense was 51 primarily attributable to increases in the weighted average on peak/off peak cost per MWh, offset in part by a decrease in MWhs purchased. OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE Operating and maintenance (O&M) expense decreased $23 million, or 2%, compared to 2000, excluding the effects of restructuring. The decrease in O&M expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in customer credit and billing costs due to process improvements and a decrease in storm restoration and service reliability costs, partially offset by higher administrative and general costs. MERGER RELATED COSTS Merger related costs charged to expense in 2000 were $67 million consisting of $26 million of direct incremental costs and $41 million for employee costs. Direct incremental costs represent expenses directly associated with completing the Merger, including professional fees, regulatory approval, and other merger integration costs. Employee costs represent estimated severance payments provided for under Exelons Merger Separation Plan (MSP) for eligible employees whose positions were eliminated before October 20, 2000 due to integration activities of the merged companies. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $51 million, or 7%, compared to 2000, excluding the effects of restructuring. Regulatory asset and decommissioning amortization decreased $180 million primarily due to the gain on the settlement of the common stock forward purchase arrangement in the first quarter of 2000, partially offset by a $103 million increase in goodwill amortization representing the impact of a full year of amortization expense in 2001 and a $26 million increase in depreciation expense from increased plant in service due to continued transmission and distribution capital improvements. Consistent with the provisions of the Illinois legislation, regulatory assets may be recovered at amounts that provide ComEd an earned return on common equity within the Illinois legislation earnings threshold. See ITEM 8. Financial Statements ComEd Note 5 Regulatory Issues. Annual goodwill amortization of $126 million in 2001 was discontinued in 2002 upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142). TAXES OTHER THAN INCOME Taxes other than income decreased $81 million, or 21%, compared to 2000, excluding the effects of restructuring. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily attributable to the effect of the change in certain revenue taxes from operating revenue and tax expense to collections recorded as liabilities resulting from Illinois legislation. INTEREST CHARGES Interest charges consist of interest expense and distributions on Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts. Interest charges increased $12 million, or 2%, compared to 2000, excluding the effects of restructuring. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to increased interest accrued on estimated tax liabilities and interest due on amounts payable to affiliates. OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS Other income and deductions, excluding interest charges, decreased $194 million, compared to 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $113 million gain on the forward share purchase arrangement recognized during 2000 and a $115 million reduction in intercompany interest income in 2001 from an affiliate, Unicom Investment, Inc., reflecting the impact of declining interest rates and a $850 million reduction in intercompany notes receivable 52 in the fourth quarter of 2000, partially offset by the $38 million loss on the sale of Cotter Corporation, a ComEd subsidiary, recognized during 2000. INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rate was 45.5% in 2001, compared to 31.1% in 2000. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the effects of the gain on the forward share purchase arrangement recorded in 2000, which was not recognized for tax purposes, a full year of goodwill amortization in 2001, which is not deductible for tax purposes, the amortization of certain recoverable transition costs, which is not deductible for tax purposes and lower investment tax credit amortization resulting from the application of purchase accounting in connection with the Merger. EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS Extraordinary charges aggregating $6 million ($4 million, net of income taxes) were incurred in 2000, and consisted of prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of debt. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION COMED (in millions) 2000 1999 Variance Operating Revenues $ 7,012 $ 6,793 219 Fuel and Purchased Power 1,977 1,549 428 Operating and Maintenance 2,076 2,352 (276) Merger Related Costs 67 67 Depreciation and Amortization 998 836 162 Taxes Other Than Income 508 507 1 Total Operating Expenses 5,626 5,244 382 Operating Income 1,386 1,549 (163) Interest Expense (596) (602) 6 Distributions on Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely the Companys Subordinated Debt Securities (30) (30) Other, Net 308 60 248 Income Before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Items 1,068 977 91 Income Taxes 332 326 6 Net Income Before Extraordinary Items 736 651 85 Extraordinary Items (net of income taxes) (4) (28) 24 Net Income 732 623 109 Preferred and Preference Stock Dividends (3) (24) 21 Net Income on Common Stock $ 729 $ 599 $ 130 53 NET INCOME Net income increased $109 million or 18% in 2000 as compared to 1999. Net income was impacted by a $163 million decrease in operating income, offset by a $248 million increase in other income and deductions primarily attributable to a gain on the forward share purchase arrangement recognized during 2000 and an increase in intercompany interest income in 2000 as compared to 1999. OPERATING REVENUES Operating revenues increased $219 million, or 3% from 1999. Revenues from retail customers decreased $266 million primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions reflecting a 17% reduction in cooling degree days compared to the prior year as well as the migration of non residential customers to ARES or PPO. Sales for resale increased $467 million primarily due to the favorable response to wholesale power purchase contracts offered by ComEd from June 2000 to May 2001 to support the open access program in Illinois as well as increased sales to other utilities as a result of the increased availability of nuclear generation. Revenues from retail customers reflect a 3% increase in MWh sales for 2000 as compared to 1999. Residential MWh deliveries increased 1%, while non residential deliveries increased 4%. As of December 31, 2000, approximately 9,500 retail customers had elected to purchase energy from an ARES or the PPO, compared to approximately 4,700 customers as of December 31, 1999. Delivered MWh sales to such customers of 14.2 million represents 17% of total annual retail deliveries in 2000. FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER EXPENSE Fuel and purchased power expense increased $428 million, or 28% from 1999. The increase in fuel and purchased power expense was primarily attributable to the effects of the PPAs that ComEd entered into upon the sale of its fleet of fossil stations in December 1999, which resulted in increased purchased power costs, but lower fuel, O&M, and depreciation costs. OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE O&M expense decreased $276 million, or 12% from 1999. The decrease in O&M expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in expenses as a result of the sale of the fossil generation stations in December 1999 as well as shorter refueling outages and fewer forced outages at nuclear generation stations. The decrease also reflects costs incurred in 1999 to address billing and collection problems encountered following the implementation of a new customer information and billing system in July 1998 and lower administrative and general costs. These decreases in O&M expenses were partially offset by increased expenses associated with ComEds increased efforts to improve the reliability of its transmission and distribution system. MERGER RELATED COSTS Merger related costs charged to expense in 2000 were $67 million consisting of $26 million of direct incremental costs and $41 million for employee costs. Direct incremental costs represent expenses directly associated with completing the Merger, including professional fee, regulatory approval, and other Merger integration costs. Employee costs represent estimated severance payments provided under Exelons MSP for eligible employees whose positions were eliminated before October 20, 2000 due to integration activities of the merged companies. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE Depreciation and amortization expense increased $162 million, or 19% from 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to a $220 million increase in regulatory asset amortization as provided by the Illinois legislation, including the settlement of the forward share purchase 54 arrangement in 2000. The increase also reflects goodwill amortization of $23 million associated with the Merger, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in depreciation expense reflecting the fossil station sale and the fair value adjustment of ComEds nuclear stations associated with the application of purchase accounting upon completion of the Merger. TAXES OTHER THAN INCOME Taxes other than income for 2000 were consistent with 1999. INTEREST CHARGES Interest charges remained consistent from year to year. OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS Other income and deductions, excluding interest charges, increased $248 million from 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to a $168 million increase in interest income on ComEds notes receivables from an affiliate, Unicom Investment Inc., related to the December 1999 sale of the fossil stations. The increase also reflects the effects of a $113 million gain on the forward share purchase arrangement that occurred in 2000, compared to the $44 million loss recorded in 1999 on the same arrangement, partially offset by the $38 million loss on the sale of Cotter Corporation, a ComEd subsidiary, recognized during 2000. INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rate was 31.1% in 2000 compared to 33.4% in 1999. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the effects of the gain on the forward share purchase arrangement, compared to the loss that was recognized in 1999 on the same arrangement, neither of which were recognized for tax purposes. The decrease was partially offset by the investment tax credit amortization recorded in 1999 related to the fossil station sale. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM ComEd incurred extraordinary charges aggregating $6 million ($4 million, net of tax) and $46 million ($28 million, net of tax) in 2000 and 1999, respectively, consisting of prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of debt. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ComEds capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing including the issuance of commercial paper. ComEds access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and the general business condition of ComEd and the industry. ComEds business is capital intensive. Capital resources are used primarily to fund ComEds capital requirements, including construction, repayments of maturing debt, and the payment of common stock dividends to Exelon. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash flows provided by operations were $1.4 billion in 2001. ComEds cash flow from operating activities primarily results from sales of electricity to a stable and diverse base of retail customers at fixed prices. ComEds future cash flows will depend upon the ability to achieve cost savings in operations, and the impact of the economy, weather, and customer choice on its revenues. Although the amounts may vary from period to period as a result of uncertainties 55 inherent in the business, ComEd expects to continue to provide a reliable and steady source of internal cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Cash flows used in investing activities were $441 million in 2001. ComEds $400 million note receivable from PECO was repaid in the second quarter of 2001. ComEds capital expenditures were $839 million in 2001 and are expected to be approximately $781 million in 2002. Approximately two thirds of the budgeted 2002 expenditures are for additions or upgrades to existing facilities, including reliability improvements. The remaining one third is for capital additions to support customer and load growth. ComEd anticipates that it will obtain financing, when necessary, through borrowings, the issuance of preferred securities, or capital contributions from Exelon. ComEds proposed capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Cash flows used in financing activities were $1.0 billion in 2001 primarily attributable to debt service and payments of dividends to Exelon. ComEds debt financing activities in 2001 reflected the retirement of $340 million of transitional trust notes and the early retirement of $196 million in First Mortgage Bonds with available cash. ComEd expects that its common stock dividend payments to Exelon will approximate 60% of its net income in 2002. CREDIT ISSUES ComEd meets its short term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under bank credit facilities and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. ComEd, along with Exelon, PECO, and Generation are parties to a $1.5 billion unsecured 364 day revolving credit facility on December 12, 2001 with a group of banks. ComEd has a $300 million sublimit under the credit facility and uses the credit facility principally to support its $300 million commercial paper program. The credit facility requires ComEd to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of 65% or less (excluding transitional trust notes). At December 31, 2001, ComEds debt to total capitalization ratio on that basis was 45%. At December 31, 2001, ComEd had no short term borrowings. ComEds access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and its financing costs in those markets are dependent on its securities ratings. None of ComEds borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities ratings although such a downgrading could increase interest charges under certain bank credit facilities. ComEd from time to time enters into interest rate swaps and other derivatives that require the maintenance of investment grade ratings. Failure to maintain investment grade ratings would allow the counterparty to terminate the derivative and settle the transaction on a net present value basis. Under PUHCA and the Federal Power Act, ComEd can only pay dividends from retained or current earnings. However, the SEC has authorized ComEd to pay up to $500 million in dividends out of additional paid in capital, provided after December 31, 2001 ComEd may not pay dividends out of paid in capital if its common equity is less than 30% of its total capitalization (including transitional trust notes). At December 31, 2001, ComEd had retained earnings of $257 million. 56 Effective January 1, 2001, Exelon contributed to ComEd a $1.1 billion non interest bearing receivable for the purpose of funding future income tax payments resulting from the collection of instrument funding charges. Exelon repaid $125 million of this outstanding receivable during the fourth quarter of 2001 and the remainder will be repaid in the years 2002 through 2008. See ITEM 8. Financial Statements ComEd Note 17 Related Party Transactions.

ComEd has a $300 million sublimit under the credit facility. At December 31, 2001, there are no borrowings against the credit facility. (b) Letters of Credit (non debt) ComEd maintains non debt letters of credit to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. (c) Letters of Credit (Long Term Debt) Direct pay letters of credit issued in connection with variable rate debt in order to provide liquidity in the event that it is not possible to remarket all of the debt as required following specific events, including changes in the basis of determining the interest rate on the debt. As part of a settlement agreement between ComEd and the City of Chicago relating to ComEds Chicago franchise agreement, ComEd and Chicago agreed to a revised combination of ongoing work under the franchise agreement and new initiatives that total approximately $1 billion in defined transmission and distribution expenditures by ComEd to improve electric service in Chicago, of which approximately $940 million has been expended through December 31, 2001. OTHER FACTORS ComEd participates in defined benefit pension plans and postretirement welfare sponsored by Exelon. Essentially all ComEd employees are eligible to participate in these plans. In 2001, ComEds former plans were consolidated into the Exelon plans. Essentially all ComEd management employees, and electing union employees, hired on or after January 1, 2001 are eligible to participate in the newly established Exelon cash balance pension plan. Management employees who were active participants in the former ComEd pension plans on December 31, 2000 and remain employed by ComEd on January 1, 2002, will have the opportunity to continue to participate in the pension plan or to transfer to the cash balance plan. Participants in the cash balance plan, unlike participants in the other defined benefit plans, may request a lump sum cash payment upon employee termination which may result in increased cash requirements from pension plan assets. ComEd may be required to increase future funding to the pension plan as a result of these increased cash requirements. Due to the performance of the United States debt and equity markets in 2001, the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of pension and postretirement benefit plans has decreased. Also, as a result of the Merger and corporate restructuring, there was a larger than average number of employees taking advantage of retirement benefits in 2001. These factors may also result in additional future funding requirements of the pension and postretirement benefit plans. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The following areas represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain: REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers to fund costs that have not yet been incurred. 58 ComEd is currently subject to rate freezes that limit the opportunity to recover increased expenses and the costs of new investment in facilities through rates during the rate freeze period. Current rates include the recovery of ComEds existing regulatory assets. ComEd continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be required to be recognized in current period earnings. UNBILLED ENERGY REVENUES Revenues related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on daily generation volumes, estimated customer usage by class, line losses and applicable customer rates based on regression analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Customer accounts receivable as of December 31, 2001 include unbilled energy revenues of $261 million on a base of annual revenue of $6.2 billion. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ComEd utilizes derivatives to effectively convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt, manage its exposure to fluctuation in interest rates related to planned future debt issuances as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding debt that is planned for early retirement. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for under SFAS No. 133. Hedge accounting has been used for all interest rate derivatives to date based on the probability of the transaction and the expected highly effective nature of the hedging relationship between the interest rate swap contract and the interest payment or changes in fair value of the hedged debt. Dealer quotes are available for all of ComEds interest rate swap agreement derivatives. Accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) of the FASB. To the extent that changes by the DIG modify current guidance, including the normal purchases and normal sales determination, the accounting treatment for derivatives may change. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS As of December 31, 2001 ComEd had accrued liabilities of $105 million for environmental investigation and remediation costs. The liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which ComEd will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties and the timing of the remediation work. Where timing and amounts of expenditures can be reliably estimated, amounts are discounted. Where timing and amounts cannot be reliably estimated, a range is estimated and the low end of the range is recognized on an undiscounted basis. Estimates can be affected by factors including future changes in technology, changes in regulations or requirements of local governmental authorities and actual costs of disposal. 59 OUTLOOK GENERAL ComEds primary objectives are to deliver reliable service, to improve customer service and to sustain productive regulatory relationships. Achieving these goals is expected to maximize the value of ComEds energy delivery assets. Under restructuring regulations adopted at the Federal and state levels, the role of electric utilities in the supply and delivery of energy is changing. ComEd continues to be obligated to provide reliable delivery systems under cost based rates. It remains obligated, as a POLR, to supply generation service during the transition period to a competitive supply marketplace to customers who do not or cannot choose an alternate supplier. Retail competition for generation services has resulted in reduced revenues from regulated rates and the sale of increasing amounts of energy at market based rates under the PPO. ComEds revenues are affected by rate reductions and rate freezes currently in effect. The rate freeze limits ComEds ability to recover increased expenses and the costs of investments in new transmission and distribution facilities through rates. As a result, ComEds future results of operations will be dependent on its ability: o to deliver electricity to its customers cost effectively, particularly in light of the current capital expenditure requirements and caps on rates, o to realize cost savings and synergies from the Merger to offset increased costs on new investments and inflation while its delivery rates are capped and, o to manage its provider of last resort responsibilities. ComEds results of operations will be affected by a legislatively mandated 5% residential base rate reduction that became effective in October 2001, a base rate freeze that will remain generally effective until at least January 1, 2005 and the collection of transition charges through 2006. ComEds obligations to make capital expenditures, combined with the rate freeze, could affect its earnings during the rate freeze period. ComEd is obligated to make capital expenditures with respect to its transmission and distribution system, including defined projects within the City of Chicago (City) as a result of a settlement agreement with the City totaling approximately $1 billion and at least $2 billion during the period 1999 through 2004 on transmission and distribution facilities outside of the City as a result of Illinois legislation. Given ComEds commitments to improve the reliability of its transmission and distribution system, ComEd expects that its capital expenditures will exceed depreciation on its rate base assets through at least 2002. The base rate freeze will generally preclude rate recovery of and on those investments prior to January 1, 2005. Unless ComEd can offset the additional carrying costs against cost savings, its return on investment may be reduced during the period of the rate freeze and until rate increases are approved authorizing a return of and on this new investment. All of ComEds non residential customers have the right to choose their electricity suppliers, and all of its residential customers will have this right as of May 1, 2002. At December 31, 2001, approximately 21% of ComEds small commercial and industrial load, 52% of its large commercial and industrial load, and 15% of its public authority & electric railroad load were purchasing their electric energy from an ARES or the PPO. ComEd has entered into long term agreements with Generation to procure its power 60 needs and achieve some certainty during the next several years with respect to its POLR obligations. ComEds agreement allows it to obtain sufficient power to meet its power needs at fixed rates. In Illinois, utilities are required to offer bundled rates frozen at levels established prior to restructuring legislation until January 2005. The POLR issue requires resolution in the near term, as the answer will affect pricing, competitive market development and planning by utilities, alternate suppliers and customers. ComEd has made an informal proposal, regarding its future provider of last resort obligations. The proposal seeks to balance the desire for a reliable supply of electricity at a reasonable price with more price certainty for smaller customers, such as residential customers, while continuing to develop a functioning competitive wholesale market for generation services. The proposal offers large customers a default power and energy offering at spot market rates, thereby freeing the utility from maintaining a long term portfolio and making that capacity available to alternative suppliers. The proposal affords certainty of supply for large customers, but not price certainty. Recognizing that small customers may not yet have the same competitive options as large customers, the proposal offers small customers both supply and price certainty, protecting those customers from market volatility. The proposal would require regulatory action in order to become effective, and no assurance can be provided as to the timing of such action or the ultimate result of such action. Transmission. ComEd provides wholesale and unbundled retail transmission service under rates established by FERC. FERC has used its regulation of transmission to encourage competition for wholesale generation services and the development of regional structures to facilitate regional wholesale markets. In December 1999, FERC issued Order No. 2000 requiring jurisdictional utilities to file a proposal to form an RTO or, alternatively, to describe efforts to participate in or work toward participating in an RTO or explain why they were not participating in an RTO. Order 2000 is generally designed to separate the governance and operation of the transmission system from generation companies and other market participants. In response to Order 2000, ComEd and several other utilities filed a business plan in August 2001 with FERC describing the creation of Alliance Transco as an independent, for profit transmission company. In connection with the process leading to the FERC filing, ComEd issued a non binding declaration of intent to divest to Alliance Transco transmission facilities having a gross book value in excess of $1 billion. In a related action, ComEd entered into a non binding memorandum of understanding with National Grid, the proposed manager of Alliance Transco, setting forth general principles relating to the divestiture and Alliance Transco as a basis for further discussion. On December 20, 2001, FERC issued several orders relating to RTOs operating in the Midwest. In those orders, FERC, among other things, approved MISO as an RTO and found that Alliance Transco lacked sufficient scope to be a stand alone RTO. FERC also directed the Alliance participants to explore with the MISO how the participants business plan can be accommodated with the MISO operational framework and dismissed the business plan filed in August 2001 by the Alliance participants. In addition, FERC determined that National Grid is not a market participant within the meaning of Order 2000 and, thus, is eligible to become the managing member of Alliance Transco if that entity is formed. FERC further directed the Alliance participants to file a statement of their plans to join an RTO, including timeframes, within 60 days. As a result of the FERC orders, representatives of ComEd and the other Alliance participants are exploring various RTO participation options and are meeting with representatives of MISO to explore how the Alliance Transco may operate under the MISO. The Alliance participants, including ComEd, filed their discussions with MISO at the FERC in February 2002, 61 noting progress as to some issues, but also noted negotiations were ongoing. The Alliance participants also noted that they were exploring the possibility of filing their business plan within an RTO other than MISO. Following further discussions, the Alliance participants and the National Grid concluded that further negotiations with the MISO required policy resolutions from FERC. Accordingly, on March 6, 2002, the Alliance participants and National Grid submitted a petition to FERC for a declaratory order finding that the proposed policy resolutions contained in the petition provide an appropriate basis for the participation of the Alliance participants in the MISO. The filing requests FERC to approve a proposed division of responsibilities between National Grid and the MISO. It also seeks approval to use existing systems for startup of operations in order to speed up initial operations. It requests approval for the Alliance participants to purchase services from the MISO at incremental costs, and that the MISO refund the $60 million withdrawal fee, plus interest, to ComEd, Illinois Power, and Ameren, of which ComEds portion is $36 million. The $36 million was paid to the MISO by ComEd in May 2001 under a FERC approved settlement agreement allowing ComEd, Illinois Power, and Ameren to withdraw from the MISO to join the Alliance Transco. OTHER FACTORS Inflation affects ComEd through increased operating costs and increased capital costs for electric plant. As a result of the rate freeze imposed under the legislation in Illinois and price pressures due to competition, ComEd may not be able to pass the costs of inflation through to customers. ComEd participates in defined benefit pension plans and postretirement welfare sponsored by Exelon. Essentially all ComEd employees are eligible to participate in these plans. In 2001, ComEds former plans were consolidated into the Exelon plans. Exelon adopted an amendment to the former ComEd postretirement medical benefit plan that changed the eligibility requirement of the plan to cover employees taking their pensions with ten years of service after age 45 rather than ten years of service and having attained the age of 55. ComEds costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits to its retirees is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the discount rate, rates of return on plan assets, and the assumed rate of increase in health care costs. Although ComEds pension and postretirement expense is determined using three year averaging and is not as vulnerable to a single years change in rates, these costs are expected to increase in 2002 and beyond as the result of the above noted plan changes along with the affects of the decline in market value of plan assets, changes in appropriate assumed rates of return on plan assets and discount rates, and increases in health care costs. For a discussion of ComEds pension and postretirement benefit plans, see ITEM 8. Financial Statements ComEd Note 12 Retirement Benefits. Environmental. ComEds operations have in the past and may in the future require substantial capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, ComEd is generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by ComEd and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by ComEd. ComEd owns or leases a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which its operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. ComEd has identified 44 sites where former manufactured gas plant (MGP) activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. ComEd is currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject 62 to additional proceedings in the future. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, ComEd had accrued $105 million and $117 million, respectively, for environmental investigation and remediation costs, including $100 million and $110 million, respectively, (reflecting discount rates of 5.5%) for MGP investigation and remediation that currently can be reasonably estimated. ComEd expects to expend $28 million for environmental remediation activities in 2002. ComEd cannot predict whether it will incur other significant liabilities for any additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by ComEd, environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties. Security Issues and Other Impacts of Terrorist Actions. The events of September 11, 2001 have affected ComEds operating procedures and costs and are expected to affect the cost and availability of the insurance coverages that ComEd carries. ComEd has initiated security measures to safeguard its employees and critical operations and is actively participating in industry initiatives to identify methods to maintain the reliability of its delivery systems. It is expected that governmental authorities will be working to ensure that emergency plans are in place and that critical infrastructure vulnerabilities are addressed. The electric utility industry is proposing security guidelines rather than government mandated standards to protect critical infrastructures. It is not known if Federal standards will be issued to the electric or gas industries. ComEd is evaluating enhanced security measures at certain critical locations, enhanced response and recovery plans and assessing longer term design changes and redundancy measures. These measures will involve additional expense to develop and implement. ComEd carries property damage and liability insurance for its properties and operations. As a result of significant changes in the insurance marketplace, due in part to the September 11, 2001 terrorist acts, the available coverage and limits may be less than the amount of insurance obtained in the past, and the recovery for losses due to terrorists acts may be limited. ComEd is self insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Damage to ComEds properties could disrupt the transmission or distribution of electricity and significantly and adversely affect results of operations. ComEd cannot predict the effects on operations of the availability of property damage and liability coverage or any disruptions to its delivery facilities. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141), SFAS No. 142, SFAS No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), and SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144). SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and establishes criteria for the separate recognition of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. SFAS No. 141 is effective for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and intangible assets. ComEd adopted SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, goodwill recorded by ComEd is no longer subject to amortization. After January 1, 2002, goodwill will be subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test, the first step of which must be performed at least annually, or more 63 frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the fair value of the goodwill. If the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense, except at the transition date, when the loss would be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. As of December 31, 2001, ComEds Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected approximately $4.9 billion in Goodwill net of accumulated amortization. Annual amortization of goodwill of $126 million was discontinued upon adoption of SFAS No. 142. In the first quarter of 2002, ComEd completed the first step of the transitional impairment analysis which indicated that its goodwill is not impaired. SFAS No. 143 provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. Retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of SFAS No. 143 are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 with initial application as of the beginning of the fiscal year. ComEd is in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements. SFAS No. 144 establishes accounting and reporting standards for both the impairment and disposal of long lived assets. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and provisions of this statement are generally applied prospectively. ComEd is in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 144 on its financial statements and does not expect the impact to be material. PECO GENERAL On October 20, 2000, PECO became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon as a result of the transactions relating to the Merger. During January 2001, Exelon undertook a restructuring to separate its generation and other competitive businesses from its regulated energy delivery business. As part of the restructuring, the non regulated operations and related assets and liabilities of PECO, representing the generation and enterprises business segments, were transferred to separate subsidiaries of Exelon. As a result, beginning January 2001, the operations of PECO consist of its retail electricity distribution and transmission business in southeastern Pennsylvania and its natural gas distribution business located in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia. The estimated impact of the restructuring set forth herein reflects the effects of removing the generation and enterprises operations and obtaining energy and capacity from Generation under the terms of the PPA for the year ended December 31, 2000. 64 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION PECO Components of Variance Restructuring Normal (in millions) 2001 2000 Impact Operations Total Operating Revenues $ 3,965 $ 5,950 $(2,577) $ 592 $(1,985) Fuel and Purchased Power 1,802 2,127 (793) 468 (325) Operating and Maintenance 587 1,791 (1,299) 95 (1,204) Merger Related Costs 248 (181) (67) (248) Depreciation and Amortization 416 325 (142) 233 91 Taxes Other Than Income 161 237 (71) (5) (76) Total Operating Expenses 2,966 4,728 (2,486) 724 (1,762) Operating Income 999 1,222 (91) (132) (223) Interest Expense (413) (457) 48 (4) 44 Distributions on Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of a Partnership, which holds Solely Subordinated Debentures of the Company (10) (8) (2) (2) Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates, Net (41) 41 41 Other, Net 46 41 (19) 24 5 Income Before Income Taxes, Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of a Change of Accounting Principle 622 757 (21) (114) (135) Income Taxes 197 270 26 (99) (73) Net Income Before Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of a Change of Accounting Principle 425 487 (47) (15) (62) Extraordinary Item (net of income taxes) (4) 4 4 Cumulative Effect of a Change of Accounting Principle 24 (24) (24) Net Income 425 507 (71) (11) (82) Preferred Stock Dividends (10) (10) Net Income on Common Stock $ 415 $ 497 $ (71) $ (11) $ (82) NET INCOME Net income from normal operations decreased $11 million, or 3% in 2001 as compared to 2000. PECOs results from normal operations improved as a result of lower margins due to the unplanned return of certain commercial and industrial customers, milder weather, increased depreciation and amortization expense and higher interest expense partially offset by favorable rate adjustments. 65 OPERATING REVENUES Bundled service reflects deliveries to customers taking electric service under tariffed rates, which include the cost of energy, the delivery cost of the transmission and distribution of the energy and a CTC/ITC charge. Unbundled service reflects customers electing to receive electric generation service from an alternative energy supplier. Revenue from customers receiving generation from an alternate supplier includes a transmission and distribution charge and a CTC/ITC charge. PECOs electric sales statistics are as follows: Deliveries (in MWh) 2001 2000 Variance BUNDLED DELIVERIES Residential 8,072,915 9,324,800 (1,251,885) Small Commercial & Industrial 5,997,571 3,918,529 2,079,042 Large Commercial & Industrial 12,960,295 8,291,607 4,668,688 Public Authorities & Electric Railroads 765,554 478,809 286,745 27,796,335 22,013,745 5,782,590 UNBUNDLED DELIVERIES Residential 3,104,811 1,985,614 1,119,197 Small Commercial & Industrial 1,606,067 3,549,667 (1,943,600) Large Commercial & Industrial 2,351,520 7,404,363 (5,052,843) Public Authorities & Electric Railroads 7,285 300,978 (293,693) 7,069,683 13,240,622 (6,170,939) TOTAL RETAIL DELIVERIES 34,866,018 35,254,367 (388,349) Electric Revenues (in millions) 2001 2000 Variance BUNDLED REVENUE Residential $ 1,028 $ 1,113 $ (85) Small Commercial & Industrial 682 422 260 Large Commercial & Industrial 929 532 397 Public Authorities & Electric Railroads 72 47 25 2,711 2,114 597 UNBUNDLED REVENUE Residential 235 135 100 Small Commercial & Industrial 81 154 (73) Large Commercial & Industrial 64 180 (116) Public Authorities & Electric Railroads 1 11 (10) 381 480 (99) TOTAL ELECTRIC RETAIL REVENUES 3,092 2,594 498 Wholesale and Miscellaneous Revenue 219 247 (28) TOTAL ELECTRIC REVENUE $ 3,311 $ 2,841 $ 470 66 The changes in electric retail revenues for 2001, as compared to 2000, are as follows: (in millions) Variance Customer Choice $ 276 Rate Changes 241 Weather (5) Other Effects (14) Retail Revenue $ 498 Customer Choice. All PECO customers have choice to purchase energy from other suppliers. This choice generally does not impact kWh deliveries, but reduces revenue collected from customers because they are not obtaining generation supply from PECO. Customers who are served by an alternate supplier continue to pay competitive transition charges. As of December 31, 2001, the customer load served by alternate suppliers was 1,003 MWh or 13.0% as compared to the same prior year period of 2,631 MW or 34.9%. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the percent of MWh sold by PECO increased by 17.2% to 79.8% of total retail deliveries as compared to 62.6% in 2000. This reduction in the customer load and the percentage of MWh served by alternate suppliers, primarily resulted from small and large commercial and industrial customers selecting or returning to PECO as their electric generation supplier. As of December 31, 2001, the number of customers served by alternate suppliers was 371,500 or 24.4% as compared to December 31, 2000 of 269,395 or 18.0%. The increase from the prior year is primarily a result of the Competitive Default Service (CDS) agreements for residential customers with the New Power Company and Green Mountain Energy Company. As of December 31, 2001, there were 227,349 residential customers assigned to these generation providers as part of the agreement. As of December 31, 2001, the customer load served by a alternate suppliers was 1,003 MWh or 13.0% as compared to the same prior year period of 2,631 MWh or 34.9%. Rate Changes. The increase in revenues attributable to rate changes reflects the expiration of a 6% reduction in PECOs electric rates in effect for 2000, partially offset by a $60 million rate reduction in effect for 2001. Weather. The demand for electricity and gas services is impacted by weather conditions. Very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months is referred to as "favorable weather conditions", because these weather conditions result in increased demand for electricity. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. The weather impact was unfavorable compared to the prior year as a result of warmer winter weather partially offset by warmer summer weather. Cooling degree days increased 34% in 2001 compared to 2000 while heating degree days decreased 12% in 2001 compared to 2000. Other Effects. Other items affecting revenue during 2001 include: o Volume. Exclusive of weather impacts, lower delivery volume affected PECOs revenue by $21 million compared to 2000. Total kWh sales to retail customers decreased 1% compared to 2000, primarily as a result of less favorable economic conditions in 2001 offset by customer growth. Large commercial and industrial sales decreased 2% and residential sales decreased 1%. These were partially offset by an increase in small commercial and industrial sales of 2%. o Other. The payment of $29 million to Generation related to nuclear decommissioning cost recovery under an agreement effective September 2001 partially offset by an $11 million settlement of competitive transition charges by a large customer. 67 PECOs gas sales statistics are as follows: 2001 2000 Variance Deliveries in million cubic feet (mmcf) 81,528 91,686 (10,158) Revenue (in millions) $ 654 $ 532 $ 122 The changes in gas revenue for 2001, as compared to 2000, are as follows: (in millions) Variance Price $ 174 Weather (38) Volume (14) Gas Revenue $ 122 o Price. The favorable variance in price is attributable to an adjustment of the purchased gas cost recovery by the PUC effective in December 2000. The average price per million cubic feet for all customers for 2001 was 38% higher than in 2000. PECOs gas rates are subject to periodic adjustments by the PUC designed to recover or refund the difference between actual cost of purchased gas and the amount included in base rates and to recover or refund increases or decreases in certain state taxes not recovered in base rates. o Weather. The unfavorable weather impact is attributable to warmer temperatures in the non summer months of 2001 than in 2000 in the PECO service territory. Heating degree days decreased 12% in 2001 compared to 2000. o Volume. Exclusive of weather impacts, lower delivery volume affected revenue by $14 million compared to 2000. Total mmcf sales to retail customers decreased 11% compared to 2000, primarily as a result of slower economic conditions in 2001 offset by increased customer growth. FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER EXPENSE Fuel and purchased power expense for 2001 increased $468 million, or 35%, as compared to the same 2000 period, excluding the effects of the restructuring. The increase in fuel and purchased power expense was primarily attributable to $293 million from customers in Pennsylvania selecting or returning to PECO as their electric generation supplier, $174 million from increased prices related to gas and higher PJM ancillary charges of $31 million. These increases were partially offset by $24 million as a result of unfavorable weather conditions and $14 million attributable to lower delivery volume related to gas. OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE O&M expense for 2001 increased $95 million, or 19%, as compared to the same 2000 period, excluding the effects of the restructuring. The increase in O&M expense was primarily attributable to $20 million related to an increased allocation of corporate expense, $18 million related to additional employee severance costs in 2001, $17 million as a result of higher administrative and general costs for functions previously performed at Corporate, $14 million related to the deployment of the automated meters during 2001, $12 million of incremental costs related to two storms in 2001, $9 million related to additional uncollectible accounts expense and $5 million associated with the write off of excess and obsolete inventory. MERGER RELATED COSTS Merger related costs charged to income in 2000 were $248 million consisting of $132 million of direct incremental costs and $116 million for employee costs. Direct incremental costs represent expenses associated with completing the Merger, including professional fees, regulatory 68 approval and settlement costs, and settlement of compensation arrangements. Employee costs represent estimated severance payments and pension and postretirement benefits provided under Exelons MSP for 642 eligible PECO employees who are expected to be involuntarily terminated before December 2002 upon completion of integration activities for the merged companies. Merger related costs attributable to the operations transferred to Generation, Enterprises and BSC in the corporate restructuring were $181 million. The remaining $67 million is attributable to PECOs energy delivery segment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data PECO Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE Depreciation and amortization expense for 2001 increased $233 million, or 127%, as compared to the same 2000 period, excluding the effects of the restructuring. The increase was primarily attributable to $214 million of additional amortization of PECOs CTC and an increase of $19 million related to depreciation expense associated with additional plant in service. The additional amortization of the CTC is in accordance with PECOs original settlement under the Pennsylvania Competition Act. TAXES OTHER THAN INCOME Taxes other than income for 2001 decreased $5 million, or 3%, as compared to the same 2000 period, excluding the effects of the restructuring. The decrease was primarily attributable to the elimination of the gross receipts tax on gas sales effective July 1, 2000. INTEREST CHARGES Interest charges consist of interest expense and distributions on Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of a Partnership (COMRPS). Interest charges increased $6 million, or 1% in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to additional interest on the Transition Bonds issued to securitize PECOs stranded cost recovery of $16 million and interest expense related to a loan from an affiliate in 2001 of $8 million, partially offset by the reduction of PECOs long term debt with the proceeds from Transition Bonds, which reduced interest charges by $18 million. EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES As part of the corporate restructuring, PECOs unconsolidated affiliates were transferred to Generation and Enterprises. OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS Other income and deductions excluding interest charges and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates increased $24 million, or 109% in 2001 as compared to 2000, excluding the effects of the restructuring. The increase in other income and deductions was primarily attributable to intercompany interest income of $10 million in the third quarter of 2001, a gain on the settlement of an interest rate swap of $6 million and the favorable settlement of a customer contract of $3 million. INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was 31.7% in 2001 as compared to 35.7% in 2000. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to tax benefits associated with the implementation of State tax planning Strategies, a favorable adjustment to prior period income taxes in connection with the completion of the 2000 tax return and the reduced impact of investment tax credit amortization. 69 EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS In 2000, PECO incurred extraordinary charges aggregating $6 million ($4 million, net of tax) related to prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of debt with a portion of the proceeds from the securitization of PECOs stranded cost recovery in May 2000. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE In 2000, PECO recorded a benefit of $40 million ($24 million, net of tax) representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method for nuclear outage costs in conjunction with the synchronization of accounting policies in connection with the Merger. PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS Preferred stock dividends for 2001 were consistent as compared to 2000. 70 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION PECO (in millions) 2000 1999 Variance Operating Revenues $5,950 $5,478 $ 472 Fuel and Purchased Power 2,127 2,152 (25) Operating and Maintenance 1,791 1,454 337 Merger Related Costs 248 248 Depreciation and Amortization 325 237 88 Taxes Other Than Income 237 262 (25) Total Operating Expenses 4,728 4,105 623 Operating Income 1,222 1,373 (151) Interest Expense (457) (396) (61) Distributions on Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of a Partnership, which holds Solely Subordinated Debentures of the Company (8) (21) 13 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates, Net (41) (38) (3) Other, Net 41 59 (18) Income Before Income Taxes, Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of a Change of Accounting Principle 757 977 (220) Income Taxes 270 358 (88) Net Income Before Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of Changes of Accounting Principles 487 619 (132) Extraordinary Item (net of income taxes) (4) (37) 33 Cumulative Effect of Changes of Accounting Principles 24 24 Net Income 507 582 (75) Preferred Stock Dividends (10) (12) 2 Net Income on Common Stock $ 497 $ 570 $ (73) NET INCOME Net income decreased $75 million, or 13% in 2000, as compared to 1999 reflecting merger related expenses and amortization of CTCs in 2000. 71 OPERATING REVENUES (in millions, except percentage data) 2000 1999 $ Variance % Variance Energy Delivery $3,373 $3,265 $ 108 3.3% Generation 1,931 2,097 (166) (7.9)% Enterprises 646 116 530 456.9% $5,950 $5,478 $ 472 8.6% Energy Delivery. The increase in operating revenue from energy delivery was attributable to higher electric revenue of $32 million and additional gas revenue of $76 million. The increase in electric revenue reflects $102 million from customers in Pennsylvania selecting PECO as their electric generation supplier and rate adjustments in Pennsylvania, partially offset by a decrease of $69 million as a result of lower summer volume. Regulated gas revenue reflected increases of $44 million related to higher prices, $29 million attributable to increased volume from new and existing customers and $24 million from increased winter volume. These increases were partially offset by $21 million of lower gross receipts tax collections as a result of the repeal of the gross receipts tax on gas sales in connection with gas restructuring in Pennsylvania. Generation. The decrease in operating revenue from generation was a result of lower electric revenue of $180 million partially offset by higher gas revenue of $14 million. The decrease in electric revenue was principally attributable to lower sales of competitive retail electric generation services of $132 million, of which $196 million represented decreased volume that was partially offset by $64 million from higher prices. In addition, the termination of the management agreement for Clinton resulted in lower revenues of $99 million. As a result of the acquisition by AmerGen of Clinton in December 1999, the management agreement was terminated and, accordingly, the operations have been included in Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates on PECOs Consolidated Statements of Income in 2000. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $50 million from higher wholesale revenue attributable to $199 million associated with higher prices partially offset by $149 million related to lower volume. Unregulated gas revenue increased primarily as a result of $11 million from wholesale sales of excess natural gas. Enterprises. The increase in operating revenue from enterprises was attributable to $530 million from the acquisition of thirteen infrastructure services companies during 2000 and 1999. FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER EXPENSE (in millions, except percentage data) 2000 1999 $ Variance % Variance Energy Delivery $ 462 $ 370 $ 92 24.9% Generation 1,665 1,782 (117) (6.6)% $ 2,127 $ 2,152 $ (25) (1.2)% Energy Delivery. The increase in fuel and purchased power expense from energy delivery was primarily attributable to $73 million from additional volume and increased prices related to gas, $13 million as a result of favorable weather conditions and $4 million in additional PJM ancillary charges. 72 Generation. The decrease in fuel and purchased power expense from generation was primarily attributable to $262 million principally related to reduced sales of competitive retail electric generation services partially offset by an increase of $120 million in the cost to supply energy delivery customers and an increase of $5 million from wholesale operations principally related to $97 million as a result of increased prices partially offset by $92 million as a result of decreased volume. OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE (in millions, except percentage data) 2000 1999 $ Variance % Variance Energy Delivery $ 491 $ 434 $ 57 13.1% Generation 616 721 (105) (14.6)% Enterprises 650 136 514 377.9% Corporate 34 163 (129) (79.1)% $1,791 $1,454 $ 337 23.2% Energy Delivery. The increase in O&M expense from energy delivery was primarily attributable to the direct charging to the business segments of O&M expenses that were previously reported at PECO Corporate. Generation. The decrease in O&M expense from generation was primarily attributable to O&M expenses related to the management agreement for Clinton of $70 million in 1999 which has since been terminated, $15 million related to the abandonment of two information system implementations in 1999, $17 million related to lower administrative and general expenses related to the unregulated retail sales of electricity and $15 million related to lower joint owner expenses. Enterprises. The O&M expense from enterprises increased $505 million from the infrastructure services business as a result of acquisitions. Corporate. PECO Corporates decrease in O&M expense was primarily attributable to expenses of $56 million related to lower Year 2000 remediation expenditures, lower pension and postretirement benefits expense of $31 million and the direct charging to business segments of O&M expenses that were previously recorded at Corporate. MERGER RELATED COSTS Merger related costs charged to income in 2000 were $248 million consisting of $132 million of direct incremental costs and $116 million for employee costs. Direct incremental costs represent expenses associated with completing the Merger, including professional fees, regulatory approval and settlement costs, and settlement of compensation arrangements. Employee costs represent estimated severance payments and pension and postretirement benefits provided under Exelons MSP for 642 eligible PECO employees who are expected to be involuntarily terminated before December 2002 upon completion of integration activities for the merged companies. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE Depreciation and amortization expense increased $88 million, or 37%, to $325 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to $57 million of amortization of PECOs CTC which commenced in 2000 and $29 million related to depreciation and amortization expense associated with the infrastructure services business acquisitions. 73 TAXES OTHER THAN INCOME Taxes other than income decreased $25 million, or 10%, to $237 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower real estate taxes of $18 million relating to a change in tax laws for utility property in Pennsylvania and $11 million as a result of the elimination of the gross receipts tax on natural gas sales net of an increase in gross receipts tax on electric sales. This decrease was partially offset by a non recurring $22 million capital stock tax credit related to a 1999 adjustment associated with the impact of PECOs 1997 restructuring charge. INTEREST CHARGES Interest charges consist of interest expense and distributions on COMRPS. Interest charges increased $48 million, or 12%, to $465 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to interest on the Transition Bonds issued to securitize PECOs stranded cost recovery of $104 million, partially offset by the reduction of PECOs long term debt with the proceeds from Transition Bonds, which reduced interest charges by $77 million. EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $3 million, or 8%, to losses of $41 million in 2000 as compared to losses of $38 million in 1999. The decrease was primarily attributable to $8 million of additional losses from communications joint ventures, partially offset by $4 million of earnings from AmerGen as a result of the acquisitions of Clinton and TMI in December 1999 and Oyster Creek in September 2000. OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS Other income and deductions excluding interest charges and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $18 million, or 31%, to $41 million in 2000 as compared to $59 million in 1999. The decrease in other income and deductions was primarily attributable to the writedown of a communications investment of $33 million, a $10 million gain on the disposal of assets in 1999 and a decrease in interest income of $2 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $15 million write off in 1999 of the investment in a cogeneration facility in connection with the settlement of litigation and gains on sales of investments of $13 million. INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was 35.7% in 2000 as compared to 36.6% in 1999. EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS In 2000, PECO incurred extraordinary charges aggregating $6 million ($4 million, net of tax) related to prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of debt with a portion of the proceeds from the securitization of PECOs stranded cost recovery in May 2000. In 1999, PECO incurred extraordinary charges aggregating $62 million ($37 million, net of tax) related to prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized debt costs associated with the repayment and refinancing of debt. 74 CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE In 2000, PECO recorded a benefit of $40 million ($24 million, net of tax) representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method for nuclear outage costs in conjunction with the synchronization of accounting policies in connection with the Merger. PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS Preferred stock dividends decreased $2 million, or 17%, to $10 million as compared 1999. The decrease was attributable to the redemption of $37 million of Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock in August 1999 with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of Transition Bonds. In addition, PECO redeemed $19 million of Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock in August 2000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES PECOs capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing including the issuance of commercial paper. PECOs access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and the general business condition of PECO and the industry. PECOs business is capital intensive. Capital resources are used primarily to fund PECOs capital requirements, including construction, repayments of maturing debt and preferred securities and payment of common stock dividends to Exelon. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash flows provided by operations for 2001 were $828 million. PECOs cash flow from operating activities primarily results from sales of electricity and gas to a stable and diverse base of retail customers at fixed prices. PECOs future cash flows will depend upon the ability to achieve cost savings in operations, and the impact of the economy, weather and customer choice on its revenues. Although the amounts may vary from period to period as a result of the uncertainties inherent in its business, PECO expects that it will continue to provide a reliable and steady source of internal cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Cash flows used in investing activities for 2001 were $235 million, primarily for capital expenditures of $264 million. PECOs projected capital expenditures for 2002 are $279 million. Approximately one half of the budgeted 2002 expenditures are for capital additions to support customer and load growth and the remainder for additions to or upgrades of existing facilities. PECO anticipates that it will obtain financing, when necessary, through borrowings, the issuance of preferred securities, or capital contributions from Exelon. PECOs proposed capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Cash flows used in financing activities were $579 million in 2001 primarily attributable to debt service and payments of dividends to Exelon. Debt financing activities during 2001 included the refinancing of $805 million in PECO transition bonds. In 2001, PECO paid Exelon $342 million in common stock dividends and currently expects that the 2002 dividend will be comparable to 2001. 75 CREDIT ISSUES PECO meets its short term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under bank credit facilities and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. PECO, along with Exelon, ComEd and Generation, are parties to a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. This credit facility is used principally by PECO to support its commercial paper program. PECO has a $300 million sublimit under this credit facility. At December 31, 2001, PECO had outstanding $101 million of notes payable consisting principally of commercial paper. For 2001, the average interest rate on notes payable was approximately 2.25%. Certain of the credit agreements to which PECO is a party requires PECO to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of 65% or less, excluding securitization debt and excluding the receivable from parent recorded in PECOs shareholders equity. At December 31, 2001, the debt to total capitalization ratios on that basis for PECO was 38%. PECOs access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and its financing costs in those markets are dependent on its securities ratings. None of PECOs borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities ratings although such a downgrading could increase interest charges under PECOs bank credit facility. PECO from time to time enters into interest rate swap and other derivatives that require the maintenance of investment grade ratings. Failure to maintain investment grade ratings would allow the counterparty to terminate the derivative and settle the transaction on a net present value basis. Under PUHCA and the Federal Power Act, PECO can pay dividends only from retained or current earnings. At December 31, 2001, PECO had retained earnings of $270 million. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS PECOs contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001 representing cash obligations that are considered to be firm commitments are as follows: Payment due within Due after (in millions) Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long Term Debt $5,992 $ 548 $1,008 $1,003 $3,433 Short Term Debt 101 101 COMRPS and Preferred Stock with Mandatory Redemption Requirements 147 19 128 Operating Leases 13 2 4 4 3 Total Contractual Obligations $6,253 $ 670 $1,012 $1,007 $3,564 See ITEM 8.

PECO has a $300 million sublimit under the credit facility. At December 31, 2001, there are no borrowings against the credit facility. (b) Letters of Credit (non debt) PECO and certain of its subsidiaries maintain non debt letters of credit to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. (c) Letters of Credit (Long Term Debt) Direct pay letters of credit issued in connection with variable rate debt in order to provide liquidity in the event that it is not possible to remarket all of the debt as required following specific events, including changes in the basis of determining the interest rate on the debt. (d) Insured Long Term Debt Borrowings that have been credit enhanced through the purchase of insurance coverage equal to the amount of principal outstanding plus interest. (e) Guarantees Provide support for lines of credit, performance contracts, surety bonds and leases as required by third parties. OFF BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS PECO is party to an agreement with a financial institution under which it can sell or finance with limited recourse an undivided interest, adjusted daily, in up to $225 million of designated accounts receivable until November 2005. At December 31, 2001, PECO had sold a $225 million interest in accounts receivable, consisting of a $170 million interest in accounts receivable which PECO accounted for as a sale under SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125," and a $55 million interest in special agreement accounts receivable which was accounted for as a long term note payable. See ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data PECO, Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO retains the servicing responsibility for these receivables. The agreement requires PECO to maintain the $225 million interest, which, if not met, requires PECO to deposit cash in order to satisfy such requirements. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, PECO met this requirement and was not required to make any cash deposits. OTHER FACTORS PECO participates in defined benefit pension plans and postretirement welfare sponsored by Exelon. Essentially all PECO employees are eligible to participate in these plans. In 2001, PECOs former plans were consolidated into the Exelon plans. Essentially all PECO employees, hired on or after January 1, 2001 are eligible to participate in newly established Exelon cash balance pension plans. Employees who were active participants in the former PECO pension plans on December 31, 2000 and remain employed by PECO on January 1, 2002, will have the opportunity to continue to participate in the pension plan or to transfer to the cash balance plan. Participants in the cash balance plan, unlike participants in the other defined benefit plans, may request a lump sum cash payment upon employee termination which may result in increased cash requirements from pension plan assets. PECO may be required to increase future funding to the pension plan as a result of these increased cash requirements. 77 Due to the performance of the United States debt and equity markets in 2001, the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of pension and postretirement benefit plans has decreased. Also, as a result of the Merger and corporate restructuring, there was a larger than average number of employees taking advantage of retirement benefits in 2001. These factors may also result in additional future funding requirements of the pension and postretirement benefit plans. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The following areas represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain: REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers to fund costs which have not yet been incurred. PECO is currently subject to a rate freeze that limits the opportunity to recover increased costs and the costs of new investment in facilities through rates during the rate freeze period. Current rates include the recovery of PECOs existing regulatory assets. PECO continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be required to be recognized in current period earnings. UNBILLED ENERGY REVENUES Revenues related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which are read on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on daily generation volumes, estimated customer usage by class, line losses and applicable customer rates based on regression analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Customer accounts receivable as of December 31, 2001 include unbilled energy revenues of $100 million on a base of annual revenues of $4.0 billion. 78 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PECO utilizes derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuation in interest rates related to outstanding variable rate debt instruments and planned future debt issuances as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding debt that is planned for early retirement. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for under SFAS No. 133. Hedge accounting has been used for all interest rate derivatives to date based on the probability of the transaction and the expected highly effective nature of the hedging relationship between the interest rate swap contract and the interest payment or changes in fair value of the hedged debt. Dealer quotes are available for all of PECOs interest rate swap agreement derivatives. Accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the DIG of the FASB. To the extent that changes by the DIG modify current guidance, including the normal purchases and normal sales determination, the accounting treatment for derivatives may change. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS As of December 31, 2001 PECO had accrued liabilities of $37 million for environmental investigation and remediation costs. The liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which PECO will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties and the timing of the remediation work. Where timing and amounts of expenditures can be reliably estimated, amounts are discounted. Where timing and amounts cannot be reliably estimated, a range is estimated and the low end of the range is recognized on an undiscounted basis. Estimates can be affected by factors including future changes in technology, changes in regulations or requirements of local governmental authorities and actual costs of disposal. OUTLOOK GENERAL PECO believes that it will provide a significant and steady source of earnings. PECOs primary goals are to deliver reliable service, to improve customer service and to sustain productive regulatory relationships. Achieving these goals is expected to maximize the value of PECOs assets. Under restructuring regulations adopted at the Federal and state levels, the role of electric utilities in the supply and delivery of energy is changing. PECO continues to be obligated to provide reliable delivery systems under cost based rates. It remains obligated, as a provider of last resort, to supply generation service during the transition period to a competitive supply marketplace to customers who do not or cannot choose an alternate supplier. Retail competition for generation services has resulted in reduced revenues from regulated rates and the sale of increasing amounts of energy at market based rates. PECOs revenues will be affected by rate reductions and rate freezes currently in effect. The rate freezes limit PECOs ability to recover increased expenses and the costs of investments in new transmission and distribution facilities through rates. As a result, PECOs future results of operations will be dependent on its ability: o to deliver electricity and gas to its customers cost effectively, o to realize cost savings and synergies from the Merger to offset increased costs on new investments and inflation while its delivery rates are capped and, o to manage its provider of last resort responsibilities. 79 PECOs results will be affected by annual increases in amortization of its stranded cost recovery through 2010. PECO has been authorized to recover stranded costs of $5.3 billion ($4.9 billion of unamortized costs at December 31, 2001) over a twelve year period ending December 31, 2010 with a return on the unamortized balance of 10.75%. In 2001, revenue attributable to stranded cost recovery was $797 million and is scheduled to increase to $932 million by 2010, the final year of stranded cost recovery. Amortization of PECOs stranded cost recovery, which is a regulatory asset, is included in depreciation and amortization. The amortization expense for 2001 was $271 million and will increase to $879 million by 2010. All of PECOs retail customers have the right to choose their electricity suppliers. At December 31, 2001, approximately 28% of PECOs residential load, 6% of its small commercial and industrial load and 5% of its large commercial and industrial load were purchasing generation service from an alternate supplier. PECO has entered into a long term agreement with Generation to procure its power needs and achieve some certainty during the next several years with respect to these obligations. Because PECOs agreement with Generation allows it to obtain sufficient power at the rates it is allowed to charge to serve customers who do not choose alternate generation suppliers revenues and expenses may vary with customer choice, but income will not be significantly impacted. Transmission. PECO provides wholesale transmission service under rates established by FERC. FERC has used its regulation of transmission to encourage competition for wholesale generation services and the development of regional structures to facilitate regional wholesale markets. In December 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 requiring jurisdictional utilities to file a proposal to form an RTO or, alternatively, to describe efforts to participate in or work toward participating in an RTO or explain why they were not participating in an RTO. Order 2000 is generally designed to separate the governance and operation of the transmission system from generation companies and other market participants. PECO provides regional transmission service pursuant to a regional open access transmission tariff filed by it and the other transmission owners who are members of PJM. PJM is a power pool that integrates, through central dispatch, the generation and transmission operations of its member companies across a 50,000 square mile territory. Under the PJM tariff, transmission service is provided on a region wide, open access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM members at rates based on the costs of transmission service. PJMs Office of Interconnection is the ISO for PJM (PJM ISO) and is responsible for operation of the PJM control area and administration of the PJM open access transmission tariff. PECO and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of their transmission facilities to the PJM ISO. The PJM ISO and the transmission owners who are members of PJM, including PECO, have filed with FERC for approval of PJM as an RTO. FERC has conditionally approved the PJM RTO. OTHER FACTORS Inflation affects PECO through increased operating costs and increased capital costs for electric plant. As a result of the rate caps imposed under the legislation in Pennsylvania and price pressures due to competition, PECO may not be able to pass the costs of inflation through to customers. PECO participates in defined benefit pension plans and postretirement welfare sponsored by Exelon. Essentially all PECO employees are eligible to participate in these plans. In 2001, PECOs former plans were consolidated into the Exelon plans. PECOs costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits to its retirees is dependent upon a number of factors, such as 80 the discount rate, rates of return on plan assets, and the assumed rate of increase in health care costs. Although PECOs pension and postretirement expense is determined using three year averaging and is not as vulnerable to a single years change in rates, these costs are expected to increase in 2002 and beyond as the result of the above noted plan changes along with the affects of the decline in market value of plan assets, changes in appropriate assumed rates of return on plan assets and discount rates, and increases in health care costs. For a discussion of PECOs pension and postretirement benefit plans, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data PECO Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental. PECOs operations have in the past and may in the future require substantial capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, PECO is generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by PECO and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by PECO. PECO owns or leases a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which its operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. PECO has identified 28 sites where former MGP activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. PECO is currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, PECO had accrued $37 million and $54 million, respectively, for environmental investigation and remediation costs, including $27 million and $30 million, respectively, for MGP investigation and remediation that currently can be reasonably estimated. In conjunction with the corporate restructuring in January 2001, a portion of the environmental investigation and remediation costs were transferred to Generation. PECO expects to expend $2 million for environmental remediation activities in 2002. PECO cannot predict whether it will incur other significant liabilities for any additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by PECO, environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties. Security Issues and Other Impacts of Terrorist Actions. The events of September 11, 2001 have affected PECOs operating procedures and costs and are expected to affect the cost and availability of the insurance coverages that PECO carries. PECO has initiated security measures to safeguard its employees and critical operations and is actively participating in industry initiatives to identify methods to maintain the reliability of its delivery systems. It is expected that governmental authorities will be working to ensure that emergency plans are in place and that critical infrastructure vulnerabilities are addressed. The electric utility industry is proposing security guidelines rather than government mandated standards to protect critical infrastructures. It is not known if Federal standards will be issued to the electric or gas industries. PECO is evaluating enhanced security measures at certain critical locations, enhanced response and recovery plans and assessing longer term design changes and redundancy measures. These measures will involve additional expense to develop and implement. PECO carries property damage and liability insurance for its properties and operations. As a result of significant changes in the insurance marketplace, due in part to the September 11, 2001 terrorist acts, the available coverage and limits may be less than the amount of insurance obtained in the past, and the recovery for losses due to terrorists acts may be limited. PECO is self insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Damage to PECOs properties could disrupt the transmission or distribution 81 electricity and significantly and adversely affect results of operations. PECO cannot predict the effects on operations of the availability of property damage and liability coverage or any disruptions to its delivery facilities. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, SFAS No. 142, SFAS No. 143 and SFAS No. 144. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and establishes criteria for the separate recognition of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. SFAS No. 141 is effective for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 is effective as of January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, goodwill recorded is no longer subject to amortization. After January 1, 2002, goodwill will be subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test, the first step of which must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the fair value of the goodwill. If the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense, except at the transition date, when the loss would be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. As of December 31, 2001, PECO does not have any Goodwill reflected on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and does not expect the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142 to materially affect the results of operations. As a result of the corporate restructuring in January 2001, all of PECOs goodwill was transferred to Enterprises. SFAS No. 143 provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. PECO expects to adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of SFAS No. 143 are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. PECO is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements. SFAS No. 144 establishes accounting and reporting standards for both the impairment and disposal of long lived assets. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and provisions of this statement are generally applied prospectively. PECO is in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 144 on its financial statements, and does not expect the impact to be material. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK EXELON The information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to the information appearing under the subheading "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 82 Market Risk" under "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Exhibit 99 2 to Exelons Current Report on Form 8 K dated February 28, 2002. COMED ComEd is exposed to market risks associated with credit, interest rates and commodity price. The inherent risk in market sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, and interest rates. Exelons corporate Risk Management Committee (RMC) sets forth risk management philosophy and objectives for Exelon and its subsidiaries through a corporate policy, and establishes procedures for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of derivative activity and risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by Exelons chief risk officer and includes the chief financial officer, general counsel, treasurer, vice president of corporate planning and officers from each of the business units. The RMC reports to the board of directors on the scope of ComEds derivative activities. CREDIT RISK ComEd is obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territories, and, as a result, has a broad customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2001, ComEds ten largest customers represented approximately 3% of its retail electric revenues. ComEd manages credit risk using credit and collection policies which are regulated by the ICC. INTEREST RATE RISK ComEd uses a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to reduce interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions. ComEd also utilizes forward starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financing. These strategies are employed to maintain the lowest cost of capital. As of December 31, 2001, a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with variable rate debt would result in a $1 million decrease in pre tax earnings for 2002. ComEd has entered into an interest rate swap to manage interest rate exposure associated with a $235 million fixed rate obligation. In December 2001, ComEd entered into forward starting interest rate swaps, with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million in anticipation of the issuance of debt in the first quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, these interest rate swaps had an aggregate fair market value exposure of $1 million based on the present value difference between the contract and market rates at December 31, 2001. The aggregate fair value exposure of the interest rate swaps that would have resulted from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in the spot yield at December 31, 2001 is estimated to be $7 million. If these derivative instruments had been terminated at December 31, 2001, this estimated fair value represents the amount that would be paid by ComEd to the counterparties. The aggregate fair value exposure of the interest rate swaps that would have resulted from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the spot yield at December 31, 2001 is estimated to be $4 million. If these derivative instruments had been terminated at December 31, 2001, this estimated fair value represents the amount to be paid by the counterparties to ComEd. 83 In March 2002, ComEd settled the $250 million of forward starting interest rate swaps and paid $6 million to the counterparty. ComEd also entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $175 million in anticipation of the issuance of debt in the second half of 2002. COMMODITY PRICE RISK As part of the corporate restructuring, ComEd entered into a PPA with Generation to meet its retail customer obligations at fixed prices. ComEds principal exposure to commodity price risk is in relation to revenues collected from customers who elect the power purchase option at market based prices, and CTC revenues which are calculated to provide the customer with a credit for the market price for electricity. ComEd has performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the net impact of a 10% decrease in the average around the clock market price of electricity. Because the decrease in revenues from customers electing the power purchase option is significantly offset by increased CTC revenues, ComEd does not believe that its exposure to such a market price decrease would be material. PECO PECO is exposed to market risks associated with credit and interest rates. The inherent risk in market sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in counterparty credit and interest rates. Exelons corporate RMC sets forth risk management philosophy and objectives through a corporate policy, and establishes procedures for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of derivative activity and risk exposures. As a result of the PPA with Generation, PECO does not believe it is subject to material commodity price risk. CREDIT RISK PECO is obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. As a result, PECO has a broad customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2001, PECOs ten largest customers represented approximately 10% of its retail electric revenues. Credit risk for PECO is managed by its credit and collection policies, which is consistent with state regulatory requirements. Under the Competition Act, licensed entities, including alternate electric generating suppliers, may act as agents to provide a single bill and provide associated billing and collection services to retail customers located in PECOs retail electric service territory. Currently, there are no third parties providing billing of PECOs charges to customers or advanced metering. However, if this occurs, PECO would be subject to credit risk related to the ability of the third parties to collect such receivables from the customers. 84 INTEREST RATE RISK PECO uses a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to reduce interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions. PECO also utilizes forward starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financing. These strategies are employed to maintain the lowest cost of capital. As of December 31, 2001, a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with variable rate debt would not have a material impact on pre tax earnings for 2002. PECO has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure associated with the floating rate series of transition bonds issued to securitize PECOs stranded cost recovery. At December 31, 2001, these interest rate swaps had an aggregate fair market value exposure of $19 million based on the present value difference between the contract and market rates at December 31, 2001. The aggregate fair value exposure of the interest rate swaps that would have resulted from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in the spot yield at December 31, 2001 is estimated to be $23 million. If these derivative instruments had been terminated at December 31, 2001, this estimated fair value represents the amount that would be paid by PECO to the counterparties. The aggregate fair value exposure of the interest rate swaps that would have resulted from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the spot yield at December 31, 2001 is estimated to be $15 million. If these derivative instruments had been terminated at December 31, 2001, this estimated fair value represents the amount to be paid by PECO to the counterparties. In 1999, PECO entered into interest rate swaps relating to the Class A 3 and Class A 5 Series 1999 A Transition Bonds in the aggregate notional amount of $1.1 billion with an average interest rate of 6.65%. PECO also entered into forward starting interest rate swaps relating to these two classes of floating rate transition bonds in the aggregate notional amount of $1.1 billion with an average interest rate of 6.01%. In connection with the refinancing of a portion of the two floating rate series of transition bonds in the first quarter of 2001, PECO settled $318 million of a forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a $6 million gain which is reflected in other income and deductions. Also, in connection with the refinancing, PECO settled a portion of the interest rate swaps and the remaining portion of the forward starting interest rate swaps resulting in gains of $25 million, which were deferred and are being amortized over the expected remaining lives of the related debt. In February 2000, PECO entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $1 billion in anticipation of the issuance of $1 billion of Transition Bonds in the second quarter of 2000. In May 2000, PECO settled these forward starting interest rate swaps and paid the counterparties $13 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the life of the Transition Bonds as an increase in interest expense. 85
