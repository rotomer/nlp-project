Its executive offices are located at 1015 Third Avenue, 12th Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone number is (206) 674 3400. For information concerning the amount of revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the Company conducts its business, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Beginning in 1981, the Companys primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the Far East to the United States and related customs brokerage and import services. In the mid 1980s, the Company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and distribution services. Today the Company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location. As opportunities for profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices. While the Company has historically expanded through organic growth, the Company has also been open to growth through acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others within the industry. Airfreight Services Airfreight services accounted for approximately 42, 41, and 41 percent of the Companys 2001, 2000, and 1999 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses (net revenues), respectively. When performing airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment. When acting as a freight consolidator, the Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines. When moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation, the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment. Whether acting as an agent or consolidator, the Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with local business practices, knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures, the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand. In its airfreight forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from its customers, determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point, and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point. At the distribution point, the Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations. The Company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 to 4,500 pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers. Because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high value to weight ratio, the need for rapid delivery, or both. The Company typically delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets. Shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within forty eight hours after such delivery. During peak shipment periods, cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur. When these conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand. The Company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in cost effective combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by the Company decreases. The rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases. As a result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment, the Company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment. The Companys net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the differential between the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate which the Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services. Such ancillary services provided by the Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing, crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws. When the Company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment, its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer. 4 The Company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so. Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines. Because the Company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments, changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and frequency of service may affect its business. The Company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments. Breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from non exclusive agents for airfreight shipments. Customs Brokerage and Import Services Customs brokerage and import services accounted for approximately 35, 38, and 39 percent of the Companys 2001, 2000, and 1999 consolidated net revenues, respectively. As a customs broker, the Company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer, arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. The Company also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing, inland transportation, inventory manipulation and management, cargo insurance and product distribution. The Company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder. However, substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder. Conversely, shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer. The Company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the United States, Canada and or Mexico. The commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business required the Company to make significant modifications to its systems and traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service. During 1996 the Company established a subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin, L.L.C., to respond to customer driven requests for high end customs consulting services. The demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by the U.S. Customs Service in response to the 1993 Customs Modernization Act. Fees for these non transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures. There is currently a noticeable trend, prompted by customer demand, to quote rates on a door to door basis. Management foresees the potential, in the medium to long term, for fees normally associated with customs clearance to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the Company. Ocean Freight and Ocean Services Ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23, 21, and 20 percent of the Companys 2001, 2000, and 1999 consolidated net revenues, respectively. The Companys revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such as preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating services, and providing consultation. The Company operates Expeditors International Ocean (EIO), a Non Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the Far East to the United States. EIO also provides service, on a smaller scale, to and from any location where the Company has an office or agent. As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate. EIO solicits less than container load (LCL) freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines. EIO also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers. The Company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo. Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS) supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service. The Company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ECMS to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers. As an ocean consolidator, ECMS may obtain LCL freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers. The Companys revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling LCL cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process. 5 Marketing and Customers The Company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations. Although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process. Therefore, the Company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers. The Companys marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic, shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers. The district manager of each office is responsible for marketing, sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or she is located. All employees are responsible for customer service and relations. The Company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics. Marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the Companys services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service. The Company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers, its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success. The goods handled by the Company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination. Shipments of computer components, other electronic equipment, housewares, sporting goods, machine parts, and toys, comprise a significant percentage of the Companys business. Typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers, manufacturers and catalogue stores. Historically, no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the Companys revenues. Competition The global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited. Depending on the location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multi service networks, the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence. Historically, the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry. Recently, larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management. This trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers. These computerized customer service capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, (EDI), and on line freight tracing and tracking applications. The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers systems and the Companys systems. Freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location, transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit. Management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the Company. Accordingly, the Company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands. Management believes that the Companys existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes. Developing these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Small and middle tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term. Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill. As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions. 6 The Companys ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the industry. To this end, the Company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel. The Company believes that these incentive compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have matched only through acquisition. Currency and Other Risk Factors The nature of the Companys worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Many of the countries where the Company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the Companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents. In addition, the Companys ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, steamship lines and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good. However, changes in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, modernization of the regulations governing customs clearance, and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Companys business in unpredictable ways. Seasonality Historically, the Companys operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Companys international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods. A significant portion of the Companys revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Companys revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Companys control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Companys stock. Environmental In the United States, the Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business. The Company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years. 7 Employees At February 28, 2002, the Company employed approximately 7,590 people, 2,776 in the United States and 458 in the balance of North America, 255 in South America, 1,296 in Europe, 1,949 in the Far East & Australasia, 702 in the Near/Middle East and 154 in Africa. Approximately 944 of the Companys employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service, 4,748 in operations and 1,898 in finance and administration. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. In order to retain the services of highly qualified, experienced, and motivated employees, the Company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans. 8 Executive Officers of the Registrant The following table sets forth the names, ages, and positions of current executive officers of the Company.

Regulation With respect to the Companys activities in the air transportation industry in the United States, it is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as an indirect air carrier. The Companys overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation. The Company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices, has made application for a license, as an airfreight forwarder by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members. The majority of the Companys airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are IATA members. The Company is licensed as a customs broker by the Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury in each U.S. customs district in which it does business. All U.S. customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the Customs Service. In other jurisdictions in which the Company performs clearance services, the Company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority. The Company is registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements. The 10 FMC also is responsible for the economic regulation of NVOCC activity originating or terminating in the United States. To comply with these economic regulations, vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the U.S. The FMC has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties. The Company does not believe that current U.S. and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations. In general, the Company conducts its business activities in each country through a majority owned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country. However, the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the Companys ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority U.S. owned subsidiary. For example, foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities. When the Company encounters this sort of governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license. In cases where the Company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock, the Company consolidates the accounts of the local entity. In such cases, consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Company because of the existence of the parent subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock. Cargo Liability When acting as an airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill. The airline which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. When acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline. When acting as an ocean freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments. This liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge). The steamship line which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. In its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations, the Company does not assume cargo liability. When providing warehouse and distribution services, the Company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per lot which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track. Upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability. The Company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities. ITEM 2 PROPERTIES The Company owns a 214,000 square foot office building in downtown Seattle, a 150,000 square foot warehouse/industrial office facility in Nassau County, New York, a 27,200 square foot office facility near Seattle Tacoma International Airport, an 80,000 square foot office and warehouse facility on a ten acre parcel near OHare International Airport in Chicago, a 5,500 square foot office facility in the Tsim Sha Tsui East district of Kowloon, Hong Kong, and a 10,900 square foot office facility in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company also owns a 23,400 square foot office and warehouse facility on a long term renewable land lease at the Brussels Cargo facility in Brussels, Belgium, and recently completed an 85,000 square foot office and warehouse facility in Dublin, Ireland. The Company leases and maintains 60 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States and 124 offices throughout the world, each located close to an airport, ocean port, or on an important border crossing. The majority of 11 these facilities contain warehouse facilities. Lease terms are either on a month to month basis or terminate at various times through 2009. As an office matures, the Company will investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable facilities. Lease payments currently aggregate to approximately $2,354,000 per month. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that current leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases. ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is ordinarily involved in claims and lawsuits which arise in the normal course of business, none of which currently, in managements opinion, will have a significant effect on the Companys financial position.

Such forward looking statements may be included in, but not limited to, press releases, oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The words or phrases will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Furthermore, reference is also made to other sections of this report which include additional factors which could adversely impact the Companys business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all of such risk factors on the Companys business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Accordingly, forward looking statements cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of actual results. Shareholders should be aware that while the Company does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against the Companys policy to disclose to such analysts any material non public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of such statement or report. Furthermore, the Company has a policy against issuing financial forecasts or projections or confirming the accuracy of forecasts or projections issued by others. Accordingly, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of the Company. 14 RISK FACTORS DISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE International Trade The Company primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce. Everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract the Companys primary market. For example, international trade is influenced by: currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; changes in governmental policies; changes in international and domestic customs regulations; wars, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts; natural disasters; changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own; and changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum related products. Third Party Vendors The Company is a non asset based supplier of global logistics services. As a result, the Company depends on a variety of asset based third party vendors. The quality and profitability of the Companys services depend upon effective selection, management and discipline of third party vendors. Predictability of Results The Company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short term customer requirements. However, long term customer satisfaction depends upon the Companys ability to meet these unpredictable short term customer requirements. Personnel costs, the Companys single largest variable expense, are always less flexible in the very near term as the Company must staff to meet uncertain demand. As a result, short term operating results could be disproportionately affected. Foreign Operations The majority of the Companys revenues and operating income come from operations conducted outside the United States. To maintain a global service network, the Company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations. Key Personnel The Company is a service business. The quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the Companys employees. Identifying, training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability. Continued loyalty to the Company will not be assured by contract. Technology Increasingly, the Company must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses. Future results depend upon the Companys success in the cost effective development and integration of communication and information systems technologies. Growth To date, the Company has relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition. Future results will depend upon the Companys ability to continue to grow internally or to demonstrate the ability to successfully identify and integrate non dilutive acquisitions. 15 ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding and consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in many of its international offices. The Company also provides additional services for its customers including value added distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions. The Company offers domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international shipments. The Company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business. The Company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships. International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions. The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the Companys business. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Companys business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business. The Companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. However, changes in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage, and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Companys business in unpredictable ways. Historically, the Companys operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern is the result of, or is influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Companys international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods. A significant portion of the Companys revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Companys revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Companys control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Companys stock. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management believes that the nature of the Companys business is such that there are few, if any, complex challenges in accounting for operations. While judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the Companys use of estimates is limited primarily to the areas of accounts receivable valuation, the useful lives of long term assets and the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the Company provides areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the Companys statement of earnings. Management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non aggressive in approach and consistent in application. Management believes that there are limited, if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the Companys transactions. While the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates, the Company 16 believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported. Results of Operations The following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less transportation expenses) attributable to the Companys principal services and the Companys expenses for 2001, 2000 and 1999, expressed as percentages of net revenues. With respect to the Companys services other than freight consolidation, net revenues are identical to revenues. Management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the Companys principal services since total revenues earned by the Company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the Company. 2001 2000 1999 In thousands Amount Percent of net revenues Amount Percent of net revenues Amount Percent of net revenues Net revenues: Airfreight $ 254,502 42 % $ 225,428 41 % $ 183,767 41 % Ocean freight and ocean services 138,881 23 114,974 21 87,181 20 Customs brokerage and import services 213,153 35 207,953 38 171,538 39 Net revenues 606,536 100 548,355 100 442,486 100 Operating expenses: Salaries and related costs 325,545 54 290,581 53 240,740 54 Other 134,974 22 130,250 24 108,423 25 Total operating expenses 460,519 76 420,831 77 349,163 79 Operating income 146,017 24 127,524 23 93,323 21 Other income, net 8,277 1 5,824 1 1,322 0 Earnings before income taxes 154,294 25 133,348 24 94,645 21 Income tax expense 57,051 9 50,313 9 35,470 8 Net earnings $ 97,243 16 % $ 83,035 15 % $ 59,175 13 % 2001 compared with 2000 Airfreight net revenues in 2001 increased 13% compared with 2000 primarily due to the Companys ability to expand airfreight margins despite the lower airfreight tonnages, experienced in 2001 compared with 2000. Airfreight margins expanded approximately 5% during 2001 as compared with 2000 despite a 9% drop in worldwide airfreight tonnage in 2001. Efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers. The Companys North American export airfreight net revenues increased 4% in 2001 compared to 2000. Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 24% and 5%, respectively, for 2001 compared with 2000. Airfreight rates on Far East to North American trade lanes, the Companys most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2001. Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 21% in 2001 compared to 2000. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2001 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Companys largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 2001, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers. Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States created new opportunities for the Companys NVOCC operations to provide services to customers who had 17 previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers. Margins increased 3% in 2001 as compared with 2000 reflecting the Companys ability to offer competitive rates to customers at the retail level, while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level. Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS), a PC based ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service, continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Companys North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 10% in 2001 compared to 2000. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 23% and 30%, respectively, for 2001 compared with 2000. Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 3% in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of (1) the Companys growing reputation for providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for nearly 36% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2001 compared with 2000. Salaries and related costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of (1) the Companys increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs increased 1% as a percentage of net revenues. The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2001 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Companys compensation program. Other operating expenses increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the Companys growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2% in 2001 as compared with 2000. Management believes that this decrease was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level. The ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level managements ability to adhere to these objectives. Other income, net, increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in 2001. Management attributes higher cash balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives. The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate in 2001 was 37%, down marginally from the 37.7% rate experienced in the prior year. The .7% decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the Company. 2000 compared with 1999 Airfreight net revenues in 2000 increased 23% compared with 1999 primarily due to (1) increased airfreight shipments and tonnages handled by the Company from the Far East to North America and Europe, (2) increased prices charged by the airlines which were passed along to customers, and (3) increased export airfreight shipments and tonnages from North America and Europe. Airfreight margins expanded approximately 2% during 2000 as compared with 1999. Higher freight volumes and efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers. The Companys North American export airfreight net revenues increased 21% in 2000 compared to 1999. Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 31% and 9%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999. Airfreight rates on Far East to North American trade lanes, the Companys most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2000. Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 32% in 2000 compared to 1999. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2000 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Companys largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 2000, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers. Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States created new opportunities for the Companys NVOCC operations to provide services to customers who had 18 previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers. Margins remained nearly constant in 2000 as compared with 1999. ECMS continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Companys North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 26% in 2000 compared to 1999. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 38% and 26%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999. Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 21% in 2000 as compared with 1999 as a result of (1) the Companys growing reputation for providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for nearly 22% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2000 compared with 1999. Salaries and related costs increased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of (1) the Companys increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs decreased 1% as a percentage of net revenues. Management believes that this decrease is due to the Companys ability to service larger freight volumes with a relatively smaller group of people. Management attributes this to technological enhancement and operational process improvement initiatives. The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2000 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Companys compensation program. Other operating expenses increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the Companys growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 1% in 2000 as compared with 1999. Other income, net, increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in 2000. Management attributes higher cash balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives. The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in 2000 at 37.7%. Currency and Other Risk Factors International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the Companys primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local broker/forwarders remain a competitive force. Historically, the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry. Customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management. Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers. Developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Smaller and middle tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term. 19 The nature of the Companys worldwide operations necessitates the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Some of the countries where the Company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the Companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents. The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Companys ability to move money freely around the world or the short term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time sensitive way to avoid short term exchange losses. Any such hedging activity during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was insignificant. Net foreign currency losses realized in 2001 were $366,000. Net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 and 1999 were $309,000 and $196,000, respectively. The current year losses were recognized primarily as a result of intercompany obligations with the Companys subsidiaries in Brazil, Taiwan, Indonesia and Turkey. The Company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight, ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services. In light of the customer driven trend to provide customer rates on a door to door basis, management foresees the potential, in the medium to long term, for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the Company. On January 1, 1999, eleven of fifteen member countries of the European Union, later joined by Greece in January 2001, established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies (legacy currencies) and a new common currency the Euro. The Euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions. The conversion to the Euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries. Beginning in January 2002, new Euro denominated bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from circulation. The Company has worked diligently to address the issues raised by the Euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate Euro denominated transactions. The conversion costs were not material. Due to numerous uncertainties, the Company is evaluating the effects one common European currency will have on pricing. The Company is unable to predict the resulting impact, if any, on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion. Sources of Growth Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill, the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business. As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the goodwill recorded in the transaction. 20 Office Additions The Company opened 7 start up offices and one office through an acquisition during 2001. The office added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk. Europe South America Africa North America UNITED KINGDOM: BRAZIL: MADAGASCAR: USA: Belfast, Northern Ireland Curitiba Antananarivo Nashville, Tennessee Bristol, England GERMANY: VENEZUELA: Nuremberg Caracas* SWITZERLAND: Chiasso Internal Growth Management believes that a comparison of same store growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the Companys internally generated growth. This same store analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Companys operating results for at least one full year. The table below presents same store comparisons on a year over year basis for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Same store comparisons for the years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net revenues 7 % 23 % 22 % Operating income 13 % 36 % 24 % Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was approximately $168 million, as compared with $154 million for 2000. This $14 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings, decreased accounts receivable and increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and taxes payable. The Companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality. Historically, the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings. This results in positive cash flow. The increased activity associated with peak season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections. This cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash. In the past, the Company has utilized short term borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows. These short term borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings. During 2001, short term borrowings were not required in the United States; the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity. As a customs broker, the Company can make significant 5 10 business day cash advances for the payment of duties and freight. These advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of credit worthy customers. Cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense, but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable. As a result of these pass through billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $53 million, as compared with $29 million during the same period of 2000. The largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company made capital expenditures of $37 million as compared with $26 million 21 for the same period in 2000. Capital expenditures in 2001 and in 2000 related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $58 million as compared with cash used in financing activities of $23 million for the same period in 2000. In 2001, the Company paid down $3 million on short term debt, as compared with $15 million for the same period of 2000. The Company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Companys stock on the open market. The differences shown at year end of 2000 and 1999 between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares. During the third quarter of 2001, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The difference shown at the end of 2001 between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock is primarily due to the repurchase of stock under the discretionary plan authorized by the Board of Directors in September 2001. The repurchase of all 1,000,000 shares was completed on October 11, 2001 at an average price of $45.12 per share. In November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Companys Discretionary Stock Repurchase Program to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2001, no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan. At December 31, 2001, working capital was $237 million, including cash and short term investments of $219 million. The Company had no long term debt at December 31, 2001. While the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment, the Company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations. The Company currently expects to spend approximately $40 million on property and equipment in 2002. In addition to normal capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, warehouse equipment, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures, this total includes estimates for a building project in Egypt. The Company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2002, with cash. The Company borrows internationally under unsecured bank lines of credit. The international bank lines of credit totaled $9.4 million. In addition, the Company maintains a bank facility with its U.K. bank for $7.3 million. At December 31, 2001, the Company was directly liable for $1.7 million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional $28.6 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations. At December 31, 2001, the Companys contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows: Payments Due by Period In thousands Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Contractual Obligations Operating Leases $ 78,308 26,422 33,274 11,463 7,149 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 518 518 Other Obligations (See Note 6.C.) 5,100 5,100 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 83,926 32,040 33,274 11,463 7,149 22 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period In thousands Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Other Commitments Lines of Credit $ 9,396 9,396 Credit Facility 7,294 7,294 Standby Letters of Credit 26,563 26,483 80 Guarantees 2,051 2,051 Total Commitments $ 45,304 43,173 80 2,051 The Company has a Non Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had repurchased and retired 2,346,196 shares of common stock at an average price of $20.82 per share over the period from 1994 through 2001. The Company also has a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which it retired 1,000,000 shares of common stock as of October 11, 2001, at an average price of $45.12 per share. In November 2001, this plan was expanded to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2001, no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan. Management believes that the Companys current cash position, bank financing arrangements, and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. In some cases, the Companys ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls. At December 31, 2001, cash and cash equivalent balances of $96 million were held by the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries, of which $35 million was held in banks in the United States. In addition, certain undistributed earnings of the Companys subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 1992 would, under most circumstances, be subject to some additional United States income tax if distributed to the Company. The Company has not provided for this additional tax because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities, or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred. Impact of Inflation To date, the Companys business has not been adversely affected by inflation, nor has the Company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases. Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term period. Due to the high degree of competition in the market place, these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the Companys margins. However, as the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate sensitive indebtedness, the Company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates. The forward looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include, but are not limited to: risks associated with foreign operations, elimination of intercompany transactions, matching of expenses with the associated revenue, seasonality, shifts in consumer demand, the effect that the implementation of the Euro as the primary currency of 12 member states of the European Union might have on the global economy and the Companys international and domestic customers, other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the Companys public reports. 23 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. These risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates. The potential impact of the Companys exposure to these risks is presented below: Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in many different countries and currencies. The Companys business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred. In the ordinary course of business, the Company creates numerous intercompany transactions. This brings a market risk to the Companys earnings. Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the Companys earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar, the Companys functional currency, relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business. All other things being equal, an average 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2001, would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $9.8 million. An average 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, for the same period, would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately $8 million. The Company has approximately $10 million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time. The Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the Companys ability to move money freely around the world. Any such hedging activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2001, was insignificant. The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings. The majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $218.7 million and short term borrowings of $1.7 million, all subject to variable short term interest rates. A hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would have an insignificant impact on the Companys earnings. In managements opinion, there has been no material change in the Companys market risk exposure between 2000 and 2001. 24

Its executive offices are located at 1015 Third Avenue, 12th Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone number is (206) 674 3400. For information concerning the amount of revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the Company conducts its business, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Beginning in 1981, the Companys primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the Far East to the United States and related customs brokerage and import services. In the mid 1980s, the Company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and distribution services. Today the Company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location. As opportunities for profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices. While the Company has historically expanded through organic growth, the Company has also been open to growth through acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others within the industry. Airfreight Services Airfreight services accounted for approximately 42, 41, and 41 percent of the Companys 2001, 2000, and 1999 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses (net revenues), respectively. When performing airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment. When acting as a freight consolidator, the Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines. When moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation, the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment. Whether acting as an agent or consolidator, the Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with local business practices, knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures, the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand. In its airfreight forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from its customers, determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point, and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point. At the distribution point, the Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations. The Company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 to 4,500 pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers. Because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high value to weight ratio, the need for rapid delivery, or both. The Company typically delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets. Shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within forty eight hours after such delivery. During peak shipment periods, cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur. When these conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand. The Company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in cost effective combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by the Company decreases. The rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases. As a result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment, the Company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment. The Companys net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the differential between the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate which the Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services. Such ancillary services provided by the Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing, crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws. When the Company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment, its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer. 4 The Company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so. Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines. Because the Company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments, changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and frequency of service may affect its business. The Company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments. Breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from non exclusive agents for airfreight shipments. Customs Brokerage and Import Services Customs brokerage and import services accounted for approximately 35, 38, and 39 percent of the Companys 2001, 2000, and 1999 consolidated net revenues, respectively. As a customs broker, the Company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer, arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. The Company also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing, inland transportation, inventory manipulation and management, cargo insurance and product distribution. The Company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder. However, substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder. Conversely, shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer. The Company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the United States, Canada and or Mexico. The commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business required the Company to make significant modifications to its systems and traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service. During 1996 the Company established a subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin, L.L.C., to respond to customer driven requests for high end customs consulting services. The demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by the U.S. Customs Service in response to the 1993 Customs Modernization Act. Fees for these non transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures. There is currently a noticeable trend, prompted by customer demand, to quote rates on a door to door basis. Management foresees the potential, in the medium to long term, for fees normally associated with customs clearance to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the Company. Ocean Freight and Ocean Services Ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23, 21, and 20 percent of the Companys 2001, 2000, and 1999 consolidated net revenues, respectively. The Companys revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such as preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating services, and providing consultation. The Company operates Expeditors International Ocean (EIO), a Non Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the Far East to the United States. EIO also provides service, on a smaller scale, to and from any location where the Company has an office or agent. As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate. EIO solicits less than container load (LCL) freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines. EIO also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers. The Company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo. Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS) supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service. The Company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ECMS to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers. As an ocean consolidator, ECMS may obtain LCL freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers. The Companys revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling LCL cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process. 5 Marketing and Customers The Company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations. Although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process. Therefore, the Company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers. The Companys marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic, shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers. The district manager of each office is responsible for marketing, sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or she is located. All employees are responsible for customer service and relations. The Company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics. Marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the Companys services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service. The Company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers, its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success. The goods handled by the Company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination. Shipments of computer components, other electronic equipment, housewares, sporting goods, machine parts, and toys, comprise a significant percentage of the Companys business. Typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers, manufacturers and catalogue stores. Historically, no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the Companys revenues. Competition The global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited. Depending on the location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multi service networks, the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence. Historically, the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry. Recently, larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management. This trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers. These computerized customer service capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, (EDI), and on line freight tracing and tracking applications. The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers systems and the Companys systems. Freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location, transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit. Management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the Company. Accordingly, the Company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands. Management believes that the Companys existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes. Developing these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Small and middle tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term. Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill. As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions. 6 The Companys ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the industry. To this end, the Company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel. The Company believes that these incentive compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have matched only through acquisition. Currency and Other Risk Factors The nature of the Companys worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Many of the countries where the Company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the Companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents. In addition, the Companys ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, steamship lines and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good. However, changes in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, modernization of the regulations governing customs clearance, and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Companys business in unpredictable ways. Seasonality Historically, the Companys operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Companys international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods. A significant portion of the Companys revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Companys revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Companys control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Companys stock. Environmental In the United States, the Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business. The Company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years. 7 Employees At February 28, 2002, the Company employed approximately 7,590 people, 2,776 in the United States and 458 in the balance of North America, 255 in South America, 1,296 in Europe, 1,949 in the Far East & Australasia, 702 in the Near/Middle East and 154 in Africa. Approximately 944 of the Companys employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service, 4,748 in operations and 1,898 in finance and administration. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. In order to retain the services of highly qualified, experienced, and motivated employees, the Company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans. 8 Executive Officers of the Registrant The following table sets forth the names, ages, and positions of current executive officers of the Company.

Regulation With respect to the Companys activities in the air transportation industry in the United States, it is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as an indirect air carrier. The Companys overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation. The Company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices, has made application for a license, as an airfreight forwarder by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members. The majority of the Companys airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are IATA members. The Company is licensed as a customs broker by the Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury in each U.S. customs district in which it does business. All U.S. customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the Customs Service. In other jurisdictions in which the Company performs clearance services, the Company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority. The Company is registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements. The 10 FMC also is responsible for the economic regulation of NVOCC activity originating or terminating in the United States. To comply with these economic regulations, vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the U.S. The FMC has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties. The Company does not believe that current U.S. and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations. In general, the Company conducts its business activities in each country through a majority owned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country. However, the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the Companys ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority U.S. owned subsidiary. For example, foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities. When the Company encounters this sort of governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license. In cases where the Company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock, the Company consolidates the accounts of the local entity. In such cases, consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Company because of the existence of the parent subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock. Cargo Liability When acting as an airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill. The airline which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. When acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline. When acting as an ocean freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments. This liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge). The steamship line which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. In its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations, the Company does not assume cargo liability. When providing warehouse and distribution services, the Company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per lot which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track. Upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability. The Company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities. ITEM 2 PROPERTIES The Company owns a 214,000 square foot office building in downtown Seattle, a 150,000 square foot warehouse/industrial office facility in Nassau County, New York, a 27,200 square foot office facility near Seattle Tacoma International Airport, an 80,000 square foot office and warehouse facility on a ten acre parcel near OHare International Airport in Chicago, a 5,500 square foot office facility in the Tsim Sha Tsui East district of Kowloon, Hong Kong, and a 10,900 square foot office facility in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company also owns a 23,400 square foot office and warehouse facility on a long term renewable land lease at the Brussels Cargo facility in Brussels, Belgium, and recently completed an 85,000 square foot office and warehouse facility in Dublin, Ireland. The Company leases and maintains 60 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States and 124 offices throughout the world, each located close to an airport, ocean port, or on an important border crossing. The majority of 11 these facilities contain warehouse facilities. Lease terms are either on a month to month basis or terminate at various times through 2009. As an office matures, the Company will investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable facilities. Lease payments currently aggregate to approximately $2,354,000 per month. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that current leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases. ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is ordinarily involved in claims and lawsuits which arise in the normal course of business, none of which currently, in managements opinion, will have a significant effect on the Companys financial position. ITEM 4 SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Inapplicable. 12 PART II ITEM 5 MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices in the over the counter market for the Companys Common Stock as reported by The NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol EXPD.

Such forward looking statements may be included in, but not limited to, press releases, oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The words or phrases will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Furthermore, reference is also made to other sections of this report which include additional factors which could adversely impact the Companys business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all of such risk factors on the Companys business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Accordingly, forward looking statements cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of actual results. Shareholders should be aware that while the Company does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against the Companys policy to disclose to such analysts any material non public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of such statement or report. Furthermore, the Company has a policy against issuing financial forecasts or projections or confirming the accuracy of forecasts or projections issued by others. Accordingly, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of the Company. 14 RISK FACTORS DISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE International Trade The Company primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce. Everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract the Companys primary market. For example, international trade is influenced by: currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; changes in governmental policies; changes in international and domestic customs regulations; wars, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts; natural disasters; changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own; and changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum related products. Third Party Vendors The Company is a non asset based supplier of global logistics services. As a result, the Company depends on a variety of asset based third party vendors. The quality and profitability of the Companys services depend upon effective selection, management and discipline of third party vendors. Predictability of Results The Company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short term customer requirements. However, long term customer satisfaction depends upon the Companys ability to meet these unpredictable short term customer requirements. Personnel costs, the Companys single largest variable expense, are always less flexible in the very near term as the Company must staff to meet uncertain demand. As a result, short term operating results could be disproportionately affected. Foreign Operations The majority of the Companys revenues and operating income come from operations conducted outside the United States. To maintain a global service network, the Company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations. Key Personnel The Company is a service business. The quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the Companys employees. Identifying, training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability. Continued loyalty to the Company will not be assured by contract. Technology Increasingly, the Company must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses. Future results depend upon the Companys success in the cost effective development and integration of communication and information systems technologies. Growth To date, the Company has relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition. Future results will depend upon the Companys ability to continue to grow internally or to demonstrate the ability to successfully identify and integrate non dilutive acquisitions. 15 ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding and consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in many of its international offices. The Company also provides additional services for its customers including value added distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions. The Company offers domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international shipments. The Company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business. The Company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships. International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions. The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the Companys business. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Companys business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business. The Companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. However, changes in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage, and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Companys business in unpredictable ways. Historically, the Companys operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern is the result of, or is influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Companys international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods. A significant portion of the Companys revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Companys revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Companys control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Companys stock. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management believes that the nature of the Companys business is such that there are few, if any, complex challenges in accounting for operations. While judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the Companys use of estimates is limited primarily to the areas of accounts receivable valuation, the useful lives of long term assets and the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the Company provides areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the Companys statement of earnings. Management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non aggressive in approach and consistent in application. Management believes that there are limited, if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the Companys transactions. While the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates, the Company 16 believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported. Results of Operations The following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less transportation expenses) attributable to the Companys principal services and the Companys expenses for 2001, 2000 and 1999, expressed as percentages of net revenues. With respect to the Companys services other than freight consolidation, net revenues are identical to revenues. Management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the Companys principal services since total revenues earned by the Company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the Company. 2001 2000 1999 In thousands Amount Percent of net revenues Amount Percent of net revenues Amount Percent of net revenues Net revenues: Airfreight $ 254,502 42 % $ 225,428 41 % $ 183,767 41 % Ocean freight and ocean services 138,881 23 114,974 21 87,181 20 Customs brokerage and import services 213,153 35 207,953 38 171,538 39 Net revenues 606,536 100 548,355 100 442,486 100 Operating expenses: Salaries and related costs 325,545 54 290,581 53 240,740 54 Other 134,974 22 130,250 24 108,423 25 Total operating expenses 460,519 76 420,831 77 349,163 79 Operating income 146,017 24 127,524 23 93,323 21 Other income, net 8,277 1 5,824 1 1,322 0 Earnings before income taxes 154,294 25 133,348 24 94,645 21 Income tax expense 57,051 9 50,313 9 35,470 8 Net earnings $ 97,243 16 % $ 83,035 15 % $ 59,175 13 % 2001 compared with 2000 Airfreight net revenues in 2001 increased 13% compared with 2000 primarily due to the Companys ability to expand airfreight margins despite the lower airfreight tonnages, experienced in 2001 compared with 2000. Airfreight margins expanded approximately 5% during 2001 as compared with 2000 despite a 9% drop in worldwide airfreight tonnage in 2001. Efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers. The Companys North American export airfreight net revenues increased 4% in 2001 compared to 2000. Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 24% and 5%, respectively, for 2001 compared with 2000. Airfreight rates on Far East to North American trade lanes, the Companys most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2001. Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 21% in 2001 compared to 2000. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2001 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Companys largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 2001, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers. Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States created new opportunities for the Companys NVOCC operations to provide services to customers who had 17 previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers. Margins increased 3% in 2001 as compared with 2000 reflecting the Companys ability to offer competitive rates to customers at the retail level, while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level. Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS), a PC based ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service, continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Companys North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 10% in 2001 compared to 2000. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 23% and 30%, respectively, for 2001 compared with 2000. Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 3% in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of (1) the Companys growing reputation for providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for nearly 36% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2001 compared with 2000. Salaries and related costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of (1) the Companys increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs increased 1% as a percentage of net revenues. The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2001 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Companys compensation program. Other operating expenses increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the Companys growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2% in 2001 as compared with 2000. Management believes that this decrease was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level. The ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level managements ability to adhere to these objectives. Other income, net, increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in 2001. Management attributes higher cash balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives. The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate in 2001 was 37%, down marginally from the 37.7% rate experienced in the prior year. The .7% decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the Company. 2000 compared with 1999 Airfreight net revenues in 2000 increased 23% compared with 1999 primarily due to (1) increased airfreight shipments and tonnages handled by the Company from the Far East to North America and Europe, (2) increased prices charged by the airlines which were passed along to customers, and (3) increased export airfreight shipments and tonnages from North America and Europe. Airfreight margins expanded approximately 2% during 2000 as compared with 1999. Higher freight volumes and efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers. The Companys North American export airfreight net revenues increased 21% in 2000 compared to 1999. Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 31% and 9%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999. Airfreight rates on Far East to North American trade lanes, the Companys most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2000. Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 32% in 2000 compared to 1999. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2000 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Companys largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 2000, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers. Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States created new opportunities for the Companys NVOCC operations to provide services to customers who had 18 previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers. Margins remained nearly constant in 2000 as compared with 1999. ECMS continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Companys North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 26% in 2000 compared to 1999. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 38% and 26%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999. Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 21% in 2000 as compared with 1999 as a result of (1) the Companys growing reputation for providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for nearly 22% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2000 compared with 1999. Salaries and related costs increased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of (1) the Companys increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs decreased 1% as a percentage of net revenues. Management believes that this decrease is due to the Companys ability to service larger freight volumes with a relatively smaller group of people. Management attributes this to technological enhancement and operational process improvement initiatives. The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2000 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Companys compensation program. Other operating expenses increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the Companys growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 1% in 2000 as compared with 1999. Other income, net, increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in 2000. Management attributes higher cash balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives. The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in 2000 at 37.7%. Currency and Other Risk Factors International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the Companys primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local broker/forwarders remain a competitive force. Historically, the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry. Customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management. Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers. Developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Smaller and middle tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term. 19 The nature of the Companys worldwide operations necessitates the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Some of the countries where the Company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the Companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents. The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Companys ability to move money freely around the world or the short term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time sensitive way to avoid short term exchange losses. Any such hedging activity during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was insignificant. Net foreign currency losses realized in 2001 were $366,000. Net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 and 1999 were $309,000 and $196,000, respectively. The current year losses were recognized primarily as a result of intercompany obligations with the Companys subsidiaries in Brazil, Taiwan, Indonesia and Turkey. The Company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight, ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services. In light of the customer driven trend to provide customer rates on a door to door basis, management foresees the potential, in the medium to long term, for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the Company. On January 1, 1999, eleven of fifteen member countries of the European Union, later joined by Greece in January 2001, established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies (legacy currencies) and a new common currency the Euro. The Euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions. The conversion to the Euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries. Beginning in January 2002, new Euro denominated bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from circulation. The Company has worked diligently to address the issues raised by the Euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate Euro denominated transactions. The conversion costs were not material. Due to numerous uncertainties, the Company is evaluating the effects one common European currency will have on pricing. The Company is unable to predict the resulting impact, if any, on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion. Sources of Growth Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill, the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business. As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the goodwill recorded in the transaction. 20 Office Additions The Company opened 7 start up offices and one office through an acquisition during 2001. The office added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk. Europe South America Africa North America UNITED KINGDOM: BRAZIL: MADAGASCAR: USA: Belfast, Northern Ireland Curitiba Antananarivo Nashville, Tennessee Bristol, England GERMANY: VENEZUELA: Nuremberg Caracas* SWITZERLAND: Chiasso Internal Growth Management believes that a comparison of same store growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the Companys internally generated growth. This same store analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Companys operating results for at least one full year. The table below presents same store comparisons on a year over year basis for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Same store comparisons for the years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net revenues 7 % 23 % 22 % Operating income 13 % 36 % 24 % Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was approximately $168 million, as compared with $154 million for 2000. This $14 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings, decreased accounts receivable and increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and taxes payable. The Companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality. Historically, the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings. This results in positive cash flow. The increased activity associated with peak season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections. This cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash. In the past, the Company has utilized short term borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows. These short term borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings. During 2001, short term borrowings were not required in the United States; the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity. As a customs broker, the Company can make significant 5 10 business day cash advances for the payment of duties and freight. These advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of credit worthy customers. Cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense, but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable. As a result of these pass through billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $53 million, as compared with $29 million during the same period of 2000. The largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company made capital expenditures of $37 million as compared with $26 million 21 for the same period in 2000. Capital expenditures in 2001 and in 2000 related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $58 million as compared with cash used in financing activities of $23 million for the same period in 2000. In 2001, the Company paid down $3 million on short term debt, as compared with $15 million for the same period of 2000. The Company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Companys stock on the open market. The differences shown at year end of 2000 and 1999 between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares. During the third quarter of 2001, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The difference shown at the end of 2001 between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock is primarily due to the repurchase of stock under the discretionary plan authorized by the Board of Directors in September 2001. The repurchase of all 1,000,000 shares was completed on October 11, 2001 at an average price of $45.12 per share. In November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Companys Discretionary Stock Repurchase Program to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2001, no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan. At December 31, 2001, working capital was $237 million, including cash and short term investments of $219 million. The Company had no long term debt at December 31, 2001. While the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment, the Company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations. The Company currently expects to spend approximately $40 million on property and equipment in 2002. In addition to normal capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, warehouse equipment, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures, this total includes estimates for a building project in Egypt. The Company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2002, with cash. The Company borrows internationally under unsecured bank lines of credit. The international bank lines of credit totaled $9.4 million. In addition, the Company maintains a bank facility with its U.K. bank for $7.3 million. At December 31, 2001, the Company was directly liable for $1.7 million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional $28.6 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations. At December 31, 2001, the Companys contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows: Payments Due by Period In thousands Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Contractual Obligations Operating Leases $ 78,308 26,422 33,274 11,463 7,149 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 518 518 Other Obligations (See Note 6.C.) 5,100 5,100 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 83,926 32,040 33,274 11,463 7,149 22 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period In thousands Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Other Commitments Lines of Credit $ 9,396 9,396 Credit Facility 7,294 7,294 Standby Letters of Credit 26,563 26,483 80 Guarantees 2,051 2,051 Total Commitments $ 45,304 43,173 80 2,051 The Company has a Non Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had repurchased and retired 2,346,196 shares of common stock at an average price of $20.82 per share over the period from 1994 through 2001. The Company also has a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which it retired 1,000,000 shares of common stock as of October 11, 2001, at an average price of $45.12 per share. In November 2001, this plan was expanded to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2001, no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan. Management believes that the Companys current cash position, bank financing arrangements, and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. In some cases, the Companys ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls. At December 31, 2001, cash and cash equivalent balances of $96 million were held by the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries, of which $35 million was held in banks in the United States. In addition, certain undistributed earnings of the Companys subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 1992 would, under most circumstances, be subject to some additional United States income tax if distributed to the Company. The Company has not provided for this additional tax because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities, or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred. Impact of Inflation To date, the Companys business has not been adversely affected by inflation, nor has the Company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases. Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term period. Due to the high degree of competition in the market place, these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the Companys margins. However, as the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate sensitive indebtedness, the Company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates. The forward looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include, but are not limited to: risks associated with foreign operations, elimination of intercompany transactions, matching of expenses with the associated revenue, seasonality, shifts in consumer demand, the effect that the implementation of the Euro as the primary currency of 12 member states of the European Union might have on the global economy and the Companys international and domestic customers, other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the Companys public reports. 23 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. These risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates. The potential impact of the Companys exposure to these risks is presented below: Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in many different countries and currencies. The Companys business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred. In the ordinary course of business, the Company creates numerous intercompany transactions. This brings a market risk to the Companys earnings. Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the Companys earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar, the Companys functional currency, relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business. All other things being equal, an average 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2001, would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $9.8 million. An average 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, for the same period, would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately $8 million. The Company has approximately $10 million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time. The Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the Companys ability to move money freely around the world. Any such hedging activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2001, was insignificant. The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings. The majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $218.7 million and short term borrowings of $1.7 million, all subject to variable short term interest rates. A hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would have an insignificant impact on the Companys earnings. In managements opinion, there has been no material change in the Companys market risk exposure between 2000 and 2001. 24 
 
ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding and consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in many of its international offices. The Company also provides additional services for its customers including value added distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions. The Company offers domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international shipments. The Company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business. The Company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships. International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions. The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the Companys business. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Companys business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business. The Companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. However, changes in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage, and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Companys business in unpredictable ways. Historically, the Companys operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern is the result of, or is influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Companys international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods. A significant portion of the Companys revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Companys revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Companys control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Companys stock. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management believes that the nature of the Companys business is such that there are few, if any, complex challenges in accounting for operations. While judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the Companys use of estimates is limited primarily to the areas of accounts receivable valuation, the useful lives of long term assets and the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the Company provides areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the Companys statement of earnings. Management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non aggressive in approach and consistent in application. Management believes that there are limited, if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the Companys transactions. While the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates, the Company 16 believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported. Results of Operations The following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less transportation expenses) attributable to the Companys principal services and the Companys expenses for 2001, 2000 and 1999, expressed as percentages of net revenues. With respect to the Companys services other than freight consolidation, net revenues are identical to revenues. Management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the Companys principal services since total revenues earned by the Company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the Company. 2001 2000 1999 In thousands Amount Percent of net revenues Amount Percent of net revenues Amount Percent of net revenues Net revenues: Airfreight $ 254,502 42 % $ 225,428 41 % $ 183,767 41 % Ocean freight and ocean services 138,881 23 114,974 21 87,181 20 Customs brokerage and import services 213,153 35 207,953 38 171,538 39 Net revenues 606,536 100 548,355 100 442,486 100 Operating expenses: Salaries and related costs 325,545 54 290,581 53 240,740 54 Other 134,974 22 130,250 24 108,423 25 Total operating expenses 460,519 76 420,831 77 349,163 79 Operating income 146,017 24 127,524 23 93,323 21 Other income, net 8,277 1 5,824 1 1,322 0 Earnings before income taxes 154,294 25 133,348 24 94,645 21 Income tax expense 57,051 9 50,313 9 35,470 8 Net earnings $ 97,243 16 % $ 83,035 15 % $ 59,175 13 % 2001 compared with 2000 Airfreight net revenues in 2001 increased 13% compared with 2000 primarily due to the Companys ability to expand airfreight margins despite the lower airfreight tonnages, experienced in 2001 compared with 2000. Airfreight margins expanded approximately 5% during 2001 as compared with 2000 despite a 9% drop in worldwide airfreight tonnage in 2001. Efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers. The Companys North American export airfreight net revenues increased 4% in 2001 compared to 2000. Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 24% and 5%, respectively, for 2001 compared with 2000. Airfreight rates on Far East to North American trade lanes, the Companys most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2001. Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 21% in 2001 compared to 2000. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2001 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Companys largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 2001, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers. Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States created new opportunities for the Companys NVOCC operations to provide services to customers who had 17 previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers. Margins increased 3% in 2001 as compared with 2000 reflecting the Companys ability to offer competitive rates to customers at the retail level, while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level. Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS), a PC based ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service, continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Companys North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 10% in 2001 compared to 2000. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 23% and 30%, respectively, for 2001 compared with 2000. Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 3% in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of (1) the Companys growing reputation for providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for nearly 36% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2001 compared with 2000. Salaries and related costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of (1) the Companys increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs increased 1% as a percentage of net revenues. The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2001 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Companys compensation program. Other operating expenses increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the Companys growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2% in 2001 as compared with 2000. Management believes that this decrease was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level. The ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level managements ability to adhere to these objectives. Other income, net, increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in 2001. Management attributes higher cash balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives. The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate in 2001 was 37%, down marginally from the 37.7% rate experienced in the prior year. The .7% decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the Company. 2000 compared with 1999 Airfreight net revenues in 2000 increased 23% compared with 1999 primarily due to (1) increased airfreight shipments and tonnages handled by the Company from the Far East to North America and Europe, (2) increased prices charged by the airlines which were passed along to customers, and (3) increased export airfreight shipments and tonnages from North America and Europe. Airfreight margins expanded approximately 2% during 2000 as compared with 1999. Higher freight volumes and efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers. The Companys North American export airfreight net revenues increased 21% in 2000 compared to 1999. Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 31% and 9%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999. Airfreight rates on Far East to North American trade lanes, the Companys most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2000. Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 32% in 2000 compared to 1999. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2000 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Companys largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 2000, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers. Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States created new opportunities for the Companys NVOCC operations to provide services to customers who had 18 previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers. Margins remained nearly constant in 2000 as compared with 1999. ECMS continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Companys North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 26% in 2000 compared to 1999. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 38% and 26%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999. Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 21% in 2000 as compared with 1999 as a result of (1) the Companys growing reputation for providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for nearly 22% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2000 compared with 1999. Salaries and related costs increased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of (1) the Companys increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs decreased 1% as a percentage of net revenues. Management believes that this decrease is due to the Companys ability to service larger freight volumes with a relatively smaller group of people. Management attributes this to technological enhancement and operational process improvement initiatives. The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2000 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Companys compensation program. Other operating expenses increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the Companys growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 1% in 2000 as compared with 1999. Other income, net, increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in 2000. Management attributes higher cash balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives. The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in 2000 at 37.7%. Currency and Other Risk Factors International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the Companys primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local broker/forwarders remain a competitive force. Historically, the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry. Customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management. Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers. Developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Smaller and middle tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term. 19 The nature of the Companys worldwide operations necessitates the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Some of the countries where the Company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the Companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents. The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Companys ability to move money freely around the world or the short term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time sensitive way to avoid short term exchange losses. Any such hedging activity during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was insignificant. Net foreign currency losses realized in 2001 were $366,000. Net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 and 1999 were $309,000 and $196,000, respectively. The current year losses were recognized primarily as a result of intercompany obligations with the Companys subsidiaries in Brazil, Taiwan, Indonesia and Turkey. The Company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight, ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services. In light of the customer driven trend to provide customer rates on a door to door basis, management foresees the potential, in the medium to long term, for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the Company. On January 1, 1999, eleven of fifteen member countries of the European Union, later joined by Greece in January 2001, established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies (legacy currencies) and a new common currency the Euro. The Euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions. The conversion to the Euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries. Beginning in January 2002, new Euro denominated bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from circulation. The Company has worked diligently to address the issues raised by the Euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate Euro denominated transactions. The conversion costs were not material. Due to numerous uncertainties, the Company is evaluating the effects one common European currency will have on pricing. The Company is unable to predict the resulting impact, if any, on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion. Sources of Growth Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill, the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business. As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the goodwill recorded in the transaction. 20 Office Additions The Company opened 7 start up offices and one office through an acquisition during 2001. The office added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk.

This same store analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Companys operating results for at least one full year. The table below presents same store comparisons on a year over year basis for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Same store comparisons for the years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net revenues 7 % 23 % 22 % Operating income 13 % 36 % 24 % Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was approximately $168 million, as compared with $154 million for 2000. This $14 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings, decreased accounts receivable and increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and taxes payable. The Companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality. Historically, the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings. This results in positive cash flow. The increased activity associated with peak season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections. This cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash. In the past, the Company has utilized short term borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows. These short term borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings. During 2001, short term borrowings were not required in the United States; the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity. As a customs broker, the Company can make significant 5 10 business day cash advances for the payment of duties and freight. These advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of credit worthy customers. Cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense, but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable. As a result of these pass through billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $53 million, as compared with $29 million during the same period of 2000. The largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company made capital expenditures of $37 million as compared with $26 million 21 for the same period in 2000. Capital expenditures in 2001 and in 2000 related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $58 million as compared with cash used in financing activities of $23 million for the same period in 2000. In 2001, the Company paid down $3 million on short term debt, as compared with $15 million for the same period of 2000. The Company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Companys stock on the open market. The differences shown at year end of 2000 and 1999 between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares. During the third quarter of 2001, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The difference shown at the end of 2001 between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock is primarily due to the repurchase of stock under the discretionary plan authorized by the Board of Directors in September 2001. The repurchase of all 1,000,000 shares was completed on October 11, 2001 at an average price of $45.12 per share. In November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Companys Discretionary Stock Repurchase Program to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2001, no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan. At December 31, 2001, working capital was $237 million, including cash and short term investments of $219 million. The Company had no long term debt at December 31, 2001. While the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment, the Company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations. The Company currently expects to spend approximately $40 million on property and equipment in 2002. In addition to normal capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, warehouse equipment, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures, this total includes estimates for a building project in Egypt. The Company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2002, with cash. The Company borrows internationally under unsecured bank lines of credit. The international bank lines of credit totaled $9.4 million. In addition, the Company maintains a bank facility with its U.K. bank for $7.3 million. At December 31, 2001, the Company was directly liable for $1.7 million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional $28.6 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations. At December 31, 2001, the Companys contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows: Payments Due by Period In thousands Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Contractual Obligations Operating Leases $ 78,308 26,422 33,274 11,463 7,149 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 518 518 Other Obligations (See Note 6.C.) 5,100 5,100 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 83,926 32,040 33,274 11,463 7,149 22 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period In thousands Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Other Commitments Lines of Credit $ 9,396 9,396 Credit Facility 7,294 7,294 Standby Letters of Credit 26,563 26,483 80 Guarantees 2,051 2,051 Total Commitments $ 45,304 43,173 80 2,051 The Company has a Non Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had repurchased and retired 2,346,196 shares of common stock at an average price of $20.82 per share over the period from 1994 through 2001. The Company also has a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which it retired 1,000,000 shares of common stock as of October 11, 2001, at an average price of $45.12 per share. In November 2001, this plan was expanded to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2001, no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan. Management believes that the Companys current cash position, bank financing arrangements, and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. In some cases, the Companys ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls. At December 31, 2001, cash and cash equivalent balances of $96 million were held by the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries, of which $35 million was held in banks in the United States. In addition, certain undistributed earnings of the Companys subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 1992 would, under most circumstances, be subject to some additional United States income tax if distributed to the Company. The Company has not provided for this additional tax because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities, or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred. Impact of Inflation To date, the Companys business has not been adversely affected by inflation, nor has the Company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases. Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term period. Due to the high degree of competition in the market place, these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the Companys margins. However, as the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate sensitive indebtedness, the Company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates. The forward looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include, but are not limited to: risks associated with foreign operations, elimination of intercompany transactions, matching of expenses with the associated revenue, seasonality, shifts in consumer demand, the effect that the implementation of the Euro as the primary currency of 12 member states of the European Union might have on the global economy and the Companys international and domestic customers, other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the Companys public reports. 23 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. These risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates. The potential impact of the Companys exposure to these risks is presented below: Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in many different countries and currencies. The Companys business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred. In the ordinary course of business, the Company creates numerous intercompany transactions. This brings a market risk to the Companys earnings. Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the Companys earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar, the Companys functional currency, relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business. All other things being equal, an average 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2001, would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $9.8 million. An average 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, for the same period, would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately $8 million. The Company has approximately $10 million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time. The Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the Companys ability to move money freely around the world. Any such hedging activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2001, was insignificant. The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings. The majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $218.7 million and short term borrowings of $1.7 million, all subject to variable short term interest rates. A hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would have an insignificant impact on the Companys earnings. In managements opinion, there has been no material change in the Companys market risk exposure between 2000 and 2001. 24
