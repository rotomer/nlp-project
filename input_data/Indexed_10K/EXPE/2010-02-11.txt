Management Overview General Description of our Business Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents and travel service providers. We make available, on a stand alone and package basis, travel products and services provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and non travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor&reg; Media Network and on our transaction based websites. Our portfolio of brands, which is described below, includes: Expedia.com&reg; , hotels.com&reg;, Hotwire.comTM, TripAdvisor Media Network, Expedia Affiliate Network (formerly Worldwide Travel Exchange and Interactive Affiliate Network), Classic Vacations&reg;, Expedia Local ExpertTM, Expedia&reg; CruiseShipCenters&reg;, Egencia TM, eLongTM, Inc. (eLong) and VenereTM Net SpA (Venere). In addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. We refer to Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as Expedia, the Company, us, we and our in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Summary of the Spin Off from IAC/InterActiveCorp On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC) announced its plan to separate into two independent public companies. We refer to this transaction as the Spin Off. A new company, Expedia, Inc., was incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold substantially all of IACs travel and travel related businesses. On August 9, 2005, the Spin Off was completed and Expedia, Inc. shares began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol EXPE. 2 Table of Contents Equity Ownership and Voting Control As of December 31, 2009, there were approximately 263,929,232 shares of Expedia common stock, 25,599,998 shares of Expedia Class B common stock and 751 shares of Expedia preferred stock outstanding. Also as of December 31, 2009, Liberty Media Corporation (Liberty), through a wholly owned subsidiary, beneficially owned approximately 27% of Expedias outstanding common stock and 100% of Expedias outstanding Class B common stock. As of such date, Barry Diller, Chairman and Senior Executive of Expedia (through his own holdings and holdings of Liberty, over which Mr. Diller generally has voting control pursuant to an irrevocable proxy granted by Liberty under the Stockholders Agreement described below) controlled approximately 59% of the outstanding total voting power of Expedia. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2005, as amended, between Liberty and Mr. Diller, Mr. Diller is effectively able to control the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of Expedias stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the Expedia common stockholders of 25% of the members of Expedias Board of Directors and certain matters as to which a separate class vote of the holders of Expedia common stock or Expedia preferred stock is required under Delaware law). In addition, pursuant to the Governance Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2005, among Expedia, Liberty and Mr. Diller, each of Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent to certain significant corporate actions in the event that Expedia or any of its subsidiaries incurs any new obligations for borrowed money within the definition of total debt set forth in the Governance Agreement for as long as Expedias ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined therein, equals or exceeds eight to one. Portfolio of Brands Expedia leverages its brand portfolio to target the broadest possible range of travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers. Our brands provide a wide selection of travel products and services, from simple, discounted travel to more complex, luxury travel. Our travel offerings primarily consist of airline flights, hotel stays, car rentals, destination services, cruises and package travel, which encompasses multiple travel products. We also offer travel and non travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction based websites. Expedia.com. Our Expedia branded websites make a large variety of travel products and services available directly to travelers through our U.S. based website, www.expedia.com, as well as through localized versions of the Expedia website in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Expedia branded websites target many different types of travelers, from families booking a summer vacation to individual travelers arranging a quick weekend getaway. Travelers can search for, compare information about (including pricing, availability and traveler reviews) and book travel products and services on Expedia branded websites, including airline tickets, lodging, car rentals, cruises and many destination services such as airport transfers, local attractions and tours from a large number of suppliers, on both a stand alone and package basis. Hotels.com. Our hotels.com website provides a broad selection of hotel properties to travelers, who can plan, shop for and book lodging accommodations, from traditional hotels to vacation rentals. Hotels.com seeks to provide travelers with premium content and service through our U.S. based website, www.hotels.com, as well as through nearly 80 localized versions in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa. With hotels.com, we differentiate our offering by positioning the brand as the hotel expert, with premium content about lodging properties. Hotwire. Our discount travel website, www.hotwire.com, makes available airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and vacation packages. Hotwire.coms approach matches flexible, price sensitive travelers with suppliers who have excess seats, rooms and cars they wish to fill without affecting the publics perception of their brands. Hotwire.com travelers may enjoy significant discounts by electing to book travel services opaquely, without knowing certain itinerary details such as brand, time of departure and exact hotel location, 3 Table of Contents while suppliers create value from excess availability without diluting their core brand loyal traveler base. Recent product innovation allows air travelers to discover available discounts by altering details of their air travel plans such as date of departure or destination airport. Hotwire.com works with many domestic and international airlines, including U.S. full service major network airlines, top hotels in hundreds of cities and resort destinations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean and major car rental companies in the United States. In 2008, Hotwire acquired a controlling interest in CarRentals.com, an online car rental marketing and retail firm offering a diverse selection of car rentals direct to consumers. Venere. Our Venere branded websites make approximately 30,000 hotel properties available to European consumers, through the website www.venere.com, and provide hoteliers with geographically diverse sources of demand. Venere has direct agency based relationships with hotels around the world. In addition, Venere hotel supply has been made available through certain of our Expedia branded and hotels.com branded websites. The TripAdvisor Media Network. TripAdvisor, our comprehensive online travel search engine and directory, aggregates traveler opinions and unbiased articles about cities, hotels, restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through www.tripadvisor.com and localized versions of the site in Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. TripAdvisor also operates in China under the brand daodao.com. In addition to travel related information, TripAdvisors destination specific search results provide links to the websites of TripAdvisors travel partners (travel providers and marketers) through which travelers can make related travel arrangements. TripAdvisor has also acquired and now operates a number of travel media content properties within the TripAdvisor Media Network, including airfarewatchdog.comTM, bookingbuddy.comTM, cruisecritic.comTM, flipkey.comTM, holidaywatchdog.comTM, independenttraveler.comTM, kuxun.cn, onetime.comTM, seatguru.com&reg;, smartertravel.comTM, travel library.comTM, travelpod.comTM, and virtualtourist.comTM, expanding the Networks reach, product breadth and appeal to domestic and international advertisers. Expedia Affiliate Network. Our private label and co brand programs make travel products and services available to travelers through third party company branded websites. The products and services made available through www.expediaaffiliate.com and www.wwte.com are substantially similar to those made available on Expedia branded and hotels.com branded websites, respectively. We generally compensate participants in the WWTE&reg; and IANTM private label programs on a revenue share basis. We also leverage our WWTE and IAN platforms to make Expedia and hotels.com branded sites available in various international points of sale. Classic Vacations. Classic Vacations offers individually tailored vacations primarily through a national network of third party retail travel agents. We deliver a full line of premium vacation packages air, hotels, car rentals, activities and private transportation to create customized luxury vacations in Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico, Costa Rica, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti. Travel agents and travelers can preview our product offering through our websites, www.classicforagents.com and www.classicvacations.com. Expedia Local Expert. Our network of travel desks located at hotels and resorts in Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, Orlando and San Francisco enables travelers to enjoy local tours, attractions and dining, as well as purchase airport transfers and other travel related services. Our network expanded through our acquisition of Activity World and Activity Hut, destination service providers in Hawaii in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and our 2005 acquisition of Premier Getaways in Florida. Expedia CruiseShipCenters. Majority owned by Expedia, CruiseShipCenters is one of North Americas leading sellers of cruise vacations. CruiseShipCenters has over 107 retail locations, a team of 2,000 professionally trained cruise consultants and a searchable online database of more than 10,000 cruise vacations. Egencia. Our full service travel management company offers travel products and services available to corporations and corporate travelers through points of sale in 15 countries across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In December 2009, Egencia expanded its footprint to nine new countries through strategic partnerships in EMEA and Asia. Egencia provides, among other things, centralized booking tools for employees of our corporate customers, unique supply targeted at business travelers, and consolidated reporting for global, large and SME (Small & Medium size Enterprise) business segments. Egencia charges its corporate clients 4 Table of Contents account management fees, as well as transactional fees for making or changing bookings. In addition, Egencia provides on site agents to some corporate clients to more fully support the account. Egencia has also begun offering consulting and meeting management services. eLong. Our majority owned online hotel and air travel service company, based in Beijing, China, specializes in travel products and services in China. eLong uses web based distribution technologies and a 24 hour nationwide call center to provide consumers with the ability to make hotel reservations at more than 10,000 hotels in over 450 cities across China and more than 100 countries worldwide. eLong also offers air ticketing and other travel related information and services. Travelers can access eLong travel products and services through its websites, including www.elong.com and www.elong.net. eLong, Inc. is a listed company, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol LONG. Business Strategy We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for leisure, unmanaged business or managed business travelers. We are committed to providing travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging Expedias critical assets our brand portfolio, technology and content innovation, global reach and breadth of product offering. In addition, we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations, activities, suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings. A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows: Portfolio of Travel Brands. We seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers, suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industry leading brands. We target several different demographics, from the value conscious traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a high touch, customized vacation package through our Classic Vacations brand. We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higher end travel packages. Our hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content about lodging properties, such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews. In the United States, hotels.com generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations, and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone. Through Egencia, we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Further, the TripAdvisor Media Network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and user generated content. We believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models, enabling them to offer their products and services to the industrys broadest range of travelers using our various agency, merchant and advertising business models. We intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio, geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers. Technology and Content Innovation. Expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation, from Expedia.coms inception as a division of Microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as Expedias introduction of its Expedia Easy Manage program, offering smaller properties in secondary and tertiary markets in Europe and Asia Pacific through an agency model hotel program, Media Solutions introduction of rich media display ads called StorePoint Expandables, TripAdvisors launch of its Family Vacation Critic, which offers reviews of kid friendly and parent tested hotels, resorts, attractions and destinations to help parents select the best family vacation, and FlipKeys launch of self service listings for vacation property owners to merchandise their offerings. We intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience, supplier integration and presentation, platform improvements, search engine marketing and search engine optimization. 5 Table of Contents Global Reach. Our Expedia, hotels.com and TripAdvisor Media Network brands operate both in North America and internationally. We also offer Chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in eLong and through our TripAdvisor brands daodao.com and kuxun.cn, and we offer hotels to European based travelers through our wholly owned subsidiary Venere, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, approximately 34% of our worldwide gross bookings and 37% of worldwide revenue were international. Egencia, our corporate travel business, operates in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region using direct points of sale as well as strategic partnerships. We believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees travel experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of Egencia. In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings, as well as proprietary and user generated content for travelers. Our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers. As an example, our traveler review feature whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites. In addition, our increasing scale enhances our websites appeal to travel and non travel advertisers. We intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale. We anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce. Future launches may occur under any of our brands, or through acquisition of third party brands, as in the case of eLong, Venere, Kuxun and Egencia. Breadth of Product Offering. We offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time. Travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer, including via our 24/7 1 800 telesales service, which is an integral part of the Companys appeal to travelers. Over 60% of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations, with less than 15% of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets. We facilitate travel products and services either as stand alone products or as part of package transactions. We have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and package businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction; however, we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our Venere brand as well as our Expedia and hotels.com brands. We also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental, destination services, cruise and other product offerings. We have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites, such as Expedia.com and hotels.com, which have historically been focused on transaction revenue. In 2009, advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 11% of worldwide revenue. Merchant and Agency Business Models We make travel products and services available both on a stand alone and package basis, primarily through two business models: the merchant model and the agency model. Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings, we are the merchant of record. Under the agency model, we act as an agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline, hotel, car rental company or cruise line. 6 Table of Contents As merchant of record, we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers (as compared to agency transactions). Also, we generally negotiate supply allocation and pricing with our suppliers, which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency model. Through our Expedia branded websites, travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component. Travelers select packages based on the total package price, without being provided component pricing. The use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models. We are also expanding our use of third party provided pre assembled package offerings, particularly through our international points of sale, further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers. Our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets, hotel, cruise and car rental reservations. Airline ticket transactions currently make up the majority of this business. In the third quarter of 2008, we acquired Venere, an agency based online hotel business in Europe and since then have launched Expedia Easy Manage, which is our agency hotel offer for small hotels and hotels in secondary or tertiary cities. Although net revenue per transaction is lower compared to the merchant model, due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings accounted for 58% of total gross bookings for the year ended December 31, 2009. Relationships with Travel Suppliers, Distribution and Fulfillment Partners Overview. We make travel products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial and charter airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, cruise lines and destination service providers. We seek to build and maintain long term, strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system (GDS) partners. An important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing, as well as build new, relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners. Travel Suppliers. We strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative, targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs. Our Partner Services Group consists mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products and brands through our points of sale, including participation in our seasonal and event driven promotions. In addition, we have developed proprietary, supplier oriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier and more cost effective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands. Through this direct connect technology, hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites, as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers. In the absence of direct connect technology, both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet. Our travelers can now book reservations with over 64,000 merchant hotel properties worldwide, of which approximately 56% are now fully direct connected. Distribution Partners. GDSs, also referred to as computer reservation services, provide a centralized, comprehensive repository of travel suppliers content such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline point to point flights, or segments. The GDSs act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies, allowing agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or other travel products. We use Sabre and Amadeus as our primary GDS segment providers. Prior to 2007, we primarily used Worldspan. We added the additional GDSs in order to ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our travelers. 7 Table of Contents Fulfillment Partners. We outsource a portion of our airline ticket fulfillment functions to third party suppliers. Such functions include the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services. Marketing and Promotions Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands, drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses, optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another. Our long term success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a cost effective manner. Our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization, offline advertising, direct and or personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct e mail communication with our travelers. Our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships. In addition, we offer several traveler loyalty programs to our worldwide travelers, including the ThankYou Rewards on Expedia.com, welcomerewards on hotels.com and Nectar in the United Kingdom. We also make use of affiliate marketing. The Expedia.com and hotels.com branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clicked through to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites. We have agreements with thousands of third party affiliate partners, including a number of leading travel companies, pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites. Affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an Expedia branded website, a co branded website or their own private label website. We also provide our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services. Operations and Technology We provide 24 hour a day, seven day a week traveler support by telephone or via e mail. For purposes of operational flexibility, we provide this support infrastructure with a combination of outsourced and in house call centers, which are located in various locations throughout the world, including extensive outsourced operations in the Philippines and El Salvador. We have made significant investments in our call center technologies in 2008 and 2009 and have plans to continue these investments going forward. Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations, mainly in the United States, which have communication links as well as 24 hour monitoring and engineering support. The web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple back up systems. Significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities. For some critical systems, we have both production and disaster recovery facilities. We have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace. For example, our Best Fare Search technology essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the United States from GDS partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to re assemble multi leg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler. We are looking to expand this technology internationally. We are also investing in improving our fare discovery technologies and user interfaces to provide more comprehensive and easier discovery of competitive rates for our travelers. We continue to invest in our operations and technology infrastructure, and we anticipate additional traveler facing benefits in 2010. Competition Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. We believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online, particularly in international markets, indicates that these 8 Table of Contents markets represent especially large opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad. Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, search engines and travel meta search engines. We face these competitors in local, regional, national and or international markets. In some cases, competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete. We differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products, channel features and usability, price or promotional offers, traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice. The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies, depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic. Our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers, such as long standing loyalty programs, no transaction fees and better pricing. Our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers (as opposed to a single supplier), and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction. We face competition from airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise operators and other travel service providers, whether working individually or collectively, some of which are suppliers to our websites. Our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape, including the emergence of new competitors or business models, and supplier consolidation. Intellectual Property Rights We regard our intellectual property rights, including our patents, service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property, as critical to our success. For example, we rely heavily upon the software code, informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service. We rely on a combination of laws, business practices and contractual obligations with employees, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties. We maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices, maintaining our current registrations, securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register domain names as we deem appropriate. We protect our trademarks and domain names with an enforcement program and use of trademark licenses. While we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names, effective trademark and domain name protection may not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark and domain name used in every country, and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract. In addition, our infringement monitoring resources may not locate every trademark or domain name infringement that exists. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available, or may be registered by us, even if available. The failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner, or challenges to our intellectual property rights, could materially adversely affect our business, result in erosion of our brand names and or limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names. We have considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us. 9 Table of Contents From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business. Regulation We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services, including registration in various states as sellers of travel and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds. In addition, our businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation, including those relating to advertising and accessibility. As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the European, Asia Pacific and other international markets, we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets, including, in some countries, laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific value added tax regimes. For example, the European Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel Package Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package, including supplier failure. Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We generate our revenue through a diverse customer base, and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers; no customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue in the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we have three reportable segments: Leisure, the TripAdvisor Media Network and Egencia. The change from two reportable segments, North America and Europe, was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands. The segment and geographic information required herein is contained in Note 16 Segment Information, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements Additional Information Company Website and Public Filings. We maintain a corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Except as explicitly noted, the information on our website, as well as the websites of our various brands and businesses, is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, or in any other filings with, or in any information furnished or submitted to, the SEC. We make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Reports on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Current Reports on Form 8 K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Code of Ethics. We post our code of business conduct and ethics, which applies to all employees, including all executive officers, senior financial officers and directors, on our corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Our code of business conduct and ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC Regulation S K and the rules of NASDAQ. We intend to disclose any changes to the code that affect the provisions required by Item 406 of Regulation S K, and any waivers of the code of ethics for our executive officers, senior financial officers or directors, on our corporate website. 10 Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 7,960 full time and part time employees, including approximately 1,770 employees of eLong. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including relationships with employees represented by works councils or other similar organizations. Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and or financial performance. We operate in an increasingly competitive global environment. The market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive. We compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel related services, including online travel agencies, travel suppliers, large online portal and search companies, traditional travel agencies, metasearch companies and operators of travel industry reservation databases. Some of our competitors, particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels, may offer products and services on more favorable terms, including lower prices, no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs, such as points and miles. Many of these competitors, such as airlines, hotel and rental car companies, have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of third party distributors such as the various Expedia sites. For instance, some low cost airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites. Suppliers who sell on their own websites, in some instances, offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours. In addition, we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies, such as priceline.com, Travelocity and Orbitz, which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers, including pricing, connectivity and supply breadth. In particular, we have faced and are facing intense competition in Europe from Booking.com, a subsidiary of Priceline. We also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply. Increasing competition from current and emerging competitors, the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies, such as metasearch and other search engine technologies, may force us to make changes to our business models, which could affect our financial performance and liquidity. Increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins, as well as loss of travelers, transactions and brand recognition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current, emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base. Global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns, including downturns in any of our major markets. In late 2008 and 2009, there was a rapid deterioration of domestic and global economic conditions, and the outlook for 2010 is uncertain. This slowing of the domestic and global economies has increased unemployment and reduced the financial capacity of both corporate and leisure travelers, thereby slowed spending on the services we provide, particularly in the first half of 2009. We cannot predict the magnitude, length or recurrence of the recessionary economic patterns. However, the continuation, or worsening, of domestic and global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our business and financial performance. Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business or financial performance. Our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry, including by decreases in hotel occupancy rates, hotel average daily rates, decreases in airline capacity or 11 Table of Contents periodically rising airline ticket prices, all of which we have recently experienced. Events or weakness specific to the air travel industry that could negatively affect our business also include fare increases, travel related strikes or labor unrest, bankruptcies or liquidations and fuel price volatility. Additionally, our business is sensitive to safety concerns, and thus our business has in the past and may in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism, during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues, as a result of natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve health related risks, such as the H1N1 and avian flu outbreaks. Such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business, working capital and financial performance over the short and long term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events, such as actual or threatened terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel products and services. Our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel supplier intermediaries. An important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers and GDS partners for bookings made through our websites. Over the last several years, air and hotel travel suppliers have generally reduced or in some cases eliminated payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries. In addition, our hotel remuneration varies with the room rates paid by travelers (Average Daily Rates, or ADRs), meaning that our revenue for each room will generally be proportionately higher or lower depending on the level of the ADR. The significant decline in ADRs, which began in late 2008 and continued into 2009, has accordingly negatively impacted our hotel booking revenue. To the extent ADRs are pressured even further in 2010, our hotel booking revenue may be further negatively impacted. During the recent decline, we have experienced a drop in ADRs generally faster than the overall industry due to a number of factors including the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional activities by hotels. We expect this trend to continue until the hotel industry begins to rebound. Also, each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous long term airline and hotel contracts. No assurances can be given that GDS partners or travel suppliers will not further reduce or eliminate compensation, attempt to charge travel agencies for content, credit card fees or other services, or further reduce their ADRs, any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance. More recently airlines have been unbundling various services such as food and beverage, baggage and other services from base airfares. GDSs have been slow to incorporate these elements into our product selection, impacting our product display and comparability with the airlines own sites or other channels that show this content detail. Adverse changes in existing relationships, increasing industry consolidation or our inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could reduce the amount, quality and breadth of attractively priced travel products and services that we are able to offer, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We rely on the value of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing. We believe continued investment in our brands, including Expedia, hotels.com, Hotwire, Classic Vacations, Egencia, eLong, Venere, the TripAdvisor Media Network and Expedia Local Expert, is critical to retaining and expanding our traveler, supplier and advertiser bases. We have and expect to continue having to spend more to maintain our brands value due to a variety of factors. These include increased spending from our competitors, the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands, expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known, inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines as destination sites for travelers. We have spent considerable financial and human resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of our brands, and we will continue to invest in, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands. We may not be able to successfully 12 Table of Contents maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost effective, or as cost effective as they have been historically. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics, or search engine disintermediation. We increasingly utilize internet search engines such as Google, principally through the purchase of travel related keywords, to generate traffic to our websites. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a users search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in pay per click and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change, both technically and competitively. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of our websites or that of our third party distribution partners, or if competitive dynamics further impact market pricing in a negative manner, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected. In addition, to the extent Google, Bing and other leading search engines attempt to more directly appeal to travel consumers by maintaining transactions within their own websites or referring those leads to suppliers directly, that could have a meaningfully adverse impact on our business and financial performance. We rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business. We depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including technology and systems used for reservations, communications, procurement and administration. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings. New developments in areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower up front technology costs. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost effective manner. We have been engaged in a multi year effort, which we expect to continue for several years, to migrate portions of our site functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to introduce innovation more rapidly, achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising capabilities, among other anticipated benefits. These migrations have been more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated, and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected our ability to develop new site innovations. Continued delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. In addition, during the migration process the sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates. Also, we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future. If any of these events occur, our business and financial performance could suffer. We rely on third parties for many systems and services. We rely on third party service providers for certain customer care, fulfillment, processing, systems development, technology and other services. If these third parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business. In addition, if such third party service providers were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations. In addition, we rely increasingly on outsourced providers of traveler care and information 13 Table of Contents technology services. If we are unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we ineffectively manage these partners, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be harmed. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. In particular, the contributions of Barry Diller, our Chairman and Senior Executive, and Dara Khosrowshahi, our Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management of the company. Our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees. Expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of Mr. Diller, Mr. Khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees, the loss of whom could seriously harm our business. Competition for well qualified employees in certain aspects of our business, including software engineers, developers and other technology professionals, also remains intense. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. We are continuing the process of restructuring portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization, improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses. These changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance. Our stock price is highly volatile. The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control: Quarterly variations in our operating results; Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; Rating agency credit rating actions; Reaction to our earnings releases and conference calls, or presentations by executives at investor and industry conferences; Changes in our capital structure; Changes in market valuations of other internet or online service companies; Announcements of dividends or changes in the amount or frequency of our dividends; Announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors; Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; Loss of a major travel supplier, such as an airline or hotel chain; Changes in the status of our intellectual property rights; Lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically; Announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us or adverse developments in pending proceedings; Additions or departures of key personnel; 14 Table of Contents Rumors or public speculation about any of the above factors; and Market and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general. Volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors, and or invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments. Our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and intend to continue to expand our international presence. To achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter, we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets, including travel supplier relationships and traveler preferences. Learning the customs and cultures of various countries, particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices, can be difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Our failure to adapt our practices and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth. We expect to continue to face additional risks in international operations. These risks include: Political instability; Threatened or actual acts of terrorism; Regulatory requirements, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti competition regulations; Our ability to comply with additional U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating internationally as well as local laws and regulations; Diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights; Increased risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights; Possible preferences by local populations for local providers; Restrictions on the withdrawal of non U.S. investment and earnings; Currency exchange restrictions; Restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash as well as restrictions on our ability to invest in our operations in certain countries; Exchange rate fluctuations; Financial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies, including our failure to adequately manage those risks; Slower adoption of the internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the United States; and Difficulties in managing staffing and operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences. Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance. Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses, including those relating to the internet and online commerce, consumer protection and privacy. Such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services, increase costs and or subject us to additional liabilities. For example, there is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce, which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of products and services. 15 Table of Contents Furthermore, the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally. Adverse application of tax laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. The application of various domestic and international sales, use, occupancy, value added and other tax laws, rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and e commerce. If the tax laws, rules and regulations were amended, if new adverse laws, rules or regulations were adopted, or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests, particularly with respect to occupancy or value added taxes, the results could increase our tax payments (prospectively or retrospectively) and or subject us to penalties and decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer. As a result, these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance. Tax authorities have brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy taxes. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments, which may be substantial, prior to contesting the validity of such assessments. This requirement is commonly referred to as pay to play. Payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes. We continue to work with relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing, new and emerging laws and regulations. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs, which may include pay to play payments, associated with complying with, and defending our position regarding, the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business. We are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are involved in various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, the legal proceedings described in discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. The defense of these actions is and may continue to be both time consuming and expensive. If these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial positions. We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company. These processing companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition, or for certain companies, at their discretion. An imposition of a holdback by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity. In addition, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites for transactions where we are merchant of record as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs. If we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites, our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected. 16 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results. Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and many different countries. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. In addition, there have been proposals to amend U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. companies are taxed on foreign earnings. We are earning an increasing portion of our income in foreign countries. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow. System interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses. We rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions. We have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers. These interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption (called denial of service or bot attacks). If we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and brands could be harmed. In addition, we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes, many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical break ins, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time. Although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets, any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers and or third parties for a significant period of time. Remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain. Intense competition for advertising revenue may adversely affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and operate profitably. Expedia, Inc. websites, including in particular the TripAdvisor Media Network, compete for advertising revenue with large internet portal sites, such as America Online and MSN, that offer listing or other advertising opportunities for travel related companies. These companies have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and large client bases. We also compete with search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo! Search that offer pay per click advertising services. In addition, we compete with newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide offline and online advertising opportunities. We expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies, including print media companies, enter the online advertising market. Competition could result in reduced margins on our advertising services, loss of market share or less use of our sites by travel companies and travelers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the TripAdvisor Media Network is increasingly reliant on natural and paid search traffic from major search engines, whose per unit costs have been increasing. Finally, to the extent Google, Bing and other leading search engines attempt to more directly appeal to travel consumers by supporting transactions within their own websites or referring those leads to suppliers directly, that could have a meaningfully adverse impact on our advertising businesses. 17 Table of Contents Mr. Diller currently controls Expedia. If Mr. Diller ceases to control the company, Liberty Media Corporation may effectively control the company. Subject to the terms of a Stockholders Agreement between Mr. Diller and Liberty Media Corporation, Mr. Diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of Expedia stock held by Liberty. Accordingly, Mr. Diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25% of the members of the Board of Directors and matters as to which Delaware law requires a separate class vote). Upon Mr. Dillers permanent departure from Expedia, the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of Expedia at such time, Liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock. Mr. Diller, through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy, controlled approximately 59% of the combined voting power of the outstanding Expedia capital stock as of January 20, 2010. In addition, under a Governance Agreement among Mr. Diller, Liberty Media Corporation and Expedia, Inc., as amended, each of Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the Governance Agreement, equals or exceeds 8:1 over a continuous 12 month period. We cannot assure you that Mr. Diller and Liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged, in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions. As a result of Mr. Dillers ownership interests and voting power, and Libertys ownership interests and voting power upon Mr. Dillers permanent departure from us, Mr. Diller is currently, and in the future Liberty may be, in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions, including, corporate transactions such as mergers, business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us. Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between Expedia management and directors, on the one hand, and the management and directors of IAC, on the other. Mr. Diller serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and Mr. Kaufman serves as Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that Messrs. Diller and Kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both IAC and Expedia stock could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for each of Messrs. Diller and Kaufman when facing decisions that may affect both IAC and Expedia. Both Messrs. Diller and Kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between IAC and Expedia. Our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between IAC and Expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping director/executive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia. We may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable. The availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control. Particularly in light of existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. In addition, any downgrade of our debt ratings by Standard & Poors, Moodys Investor Service or similar ratings agencies, increases in general interest rate levels or further weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital. More recent experience suggests credit spreads can be significantly higher for companies with lower credit ratings, impacting returns for bondholders and increasing the cost of potential future debt issuances. 18 Table of Contents In addition, we have experienced, and may experience declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business, which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow. The extent of such impact is dependent on several factors, including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business, payment terms with suppliers and relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital, such as our agency hotel, advertising and managed corporate travel businesses. We have significant long term indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. As of December 31, 2009, the face value of our long term indebtedness totaled $895 million. Risks relating to our long term indebtedness include: Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; Making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses; Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate; Possible refinancing risk if certain of our senior note issues are put by holders in 2013; Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable. In addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants. The failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants, including those that restrict our ability to, among other things: Borrow money, and guarantee or provide other support for indebtedness of third parties including guarantees; Pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock; Make investments in entities that we do not control, including joint ventures; Enter into certain asset sale transactions, including partial or full spin off transactions; Enter into secured financing arrangements; Enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and Enter into unrelated businesses. These covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses or maximize stockholder value. In addition, our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests, including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements. Such default may allow the creditors to 19 Table of Contents accelerate the related debt, which acceleration may trigger cross acceleration or cross default provisions in other debt. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings). We have foreign exchange risk. We conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States. As a result, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the British pound sterling, the euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Chinese renminbi. These exposures include but are not limited to re measurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; fluctuations in merchant hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay; planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur; and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on cross border travel, principally Europe to the United States and the United States to Europe travel. Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition. As we have seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase, and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment, and the increasingly global nature of our business has made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly. We have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope, complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management, including the use of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities. We are exposed to various counterparty risks. We are exposed to the risk of failure to perform by various financial counterparties, including for our insurance coverages, investments, bank deposits, letters of credit and foreign exchange risk management. As it relates to foreign exchange, we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2009, we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of $136 million and the fair value of which was approximately $250,000. The counterparties to these contracts were JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, RBS, Banc of America, U.S. Bank, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, HSBC and BNP Paribas. Upon the maturity of these or subsequent contracts, the counterparties are potentially obligated to pay us net settlement values. If any of these counterparties were to liquidate, declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations, it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these forward contracts. In addition, due to the weakening economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our non financial contract counterparties. Our investments in China create risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in China. We have two principal businesses operating in China: eLong, an online transactional travel business; and TripAdvisor China, which operates a media site under the brand daodao.com and a metasearch site under the brand Kuxun. The success of these businesses and any future investments we make in China are subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application, development and interpretation of Chinas laws and regulations. Significant uncertainties exist in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations including requirements to permits and licenses, and such uncertainties could limit the available legal protections relating to our investments. Moreover, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in Chinas legal system, particularly with respect to the travel industry, the internet, media, foreign investment, taxation, labor, and currency exchange and regulation, including the introduction of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations. In addition, the laws and regulations of 20 Table of Contents China restrict foreign investment in areas including the air ticketing, travel agency, internet content provision, mobile communication and related businesses. Although we have established effective control through a series of agreements between the companies in which our Chinese investments are held and their affiliated Chinese entities, future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict our ability to operate or restructure these entities or to engage in strategic transactions. Finally, China does not have treaties with the United States or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts. As a result, court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which China does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or impossible to enforce in China. Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views of personal privacy rights, or data security breaches. In the processing of our traveler transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and we rely on information collected online for purposes of advertising to visitors to our websites. This information is increasingly subject to legislation, regulations and industry policies in numerous jurisdictions around the world. These requirements and restrictions are not necessarily consistently applied. This government and industry action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. We could be adversely affected if legislation, regulations or other requirements are expanded to require changes in our current business practices or if governing jurisdictions or industry groups interpret or implement their requirements in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues for regulators and consumers, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the protections that should apply to travel and or online data. We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches. In addition, certain of our acquired companies may not have the same standards related to data collection, storage and transfer that Expedia has historically maintained. Failure to improve their standards or a substantial data breach in any of our businesses could significantly harm our business, damage our reputation, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and or cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands. These and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties. Our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses, increased complexity of our business, impairing management resources and their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and management. Further, the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, as well as the integration of an acquired business, may divert management time and other resources. Some acquisitions may not be successful and their performance may result in the impairment of their carrying value. Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are: Use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness; Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences; Costs incurred in identifying and performing due diligence on potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful; 21 Table of Contents Difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the acquired company; Impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and affiliates of our business and the acquired business; The assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the acquired company; Failure to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions and investments; Entrance into markets in which we have no direct prior experience; and Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets arising from our acquisitions. We cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors. Our websites rely on content and technology intellectual property, much of which we regard as proprietary. We protect our proprietary technology by relying on trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, patents and confidentiality agreements. In connection with our license agreements with third parties, we seek to control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Even with all of these precautions, it is possible for someone else to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or content without our authorization or to develop similar technology independently. Effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available through the internet, and policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult and expensive. We cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. This misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the future, we may need to go to court to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We currently license from third parties some of the technologies incorporated into our websites. As we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies, we may be required to license additional technology. We cannot be sure that such technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Part I. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Part I. Item 2.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, Expedia and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property, personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights and other claims. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrants business, and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation matters that the Company and its subsidiaries are defending, including those described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or results of operations based upon the standard set forth in the SECs rules. Securities Class Action Litigation against IAC Beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC) and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. These cases arose out of IACs August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value of IACs stock was artificially inflated by pre announcement statements about its financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by IACs travel businesses. On December 20, 2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits, appointed co lead plaintiffs, and designated co lead plaintiffs counsel. See In re IAC/InterActiveCorp Securities Litigation, No. 04 CV 7447 (S.D.N.Y.). Expedia is not a party to this litigation, however, under the terms of its Separation Agreement with IAC, Expedia has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities, if any, associated with any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the spin off of Expedia from IAC (the Spin Off) of the businesses or entities that comprise Expedia following the Spin Off. On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative action, Stuart Garber, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al., No. 04 603416, was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New York County) against certain of IACs officers and directors. On November 15, 2004, another related shareholder derivative action, Lisa Butler, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al., No. 04 CV 9067, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of IACs current and former directors. On January 24, 2005, the federal district court consolidated the Butler case with the securities class action for pre trial purposes only. On April 11, 2005, the district court issued a similar consolidation order in respect of the Garber case. On July 5, 2005, the plaintiffs in the related shareholder suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint against IAC (as a nominal defendant) and sixteen current or former officers or directors of IAC or its former travel business. The complaint, which is based upon factual allegations similar to those in the securities class action, purports to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and contribution and indemnification. The complaint sought an order voiding the election of IACs then Board of Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC. On September 15, 2005, IAC and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the shareholder derivative suits. On November 30, 2005, the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions. On January 6, 2006, the defendants filed reply papers in further support of the motions. The court issued an opinion and order (i) granting the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in the securities class action, with leave to replead, and (ii) granting the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in the shareholder derivative suits, with prejudice. 23 Table of Contents On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative suits filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the District Courts order of dismissal. On June 14, 2007, on consent of the parties, the appeal was withdrawn from active consideration by the Court of Appeals, subject to reinstatement by no later than March 31, 2008. On May 15, 2007, the plaintiffs in the securities class action filed a second amended complaint. The new pleading continues to allege that the defendants failed to disclose material information concerning problems at the Companys then travel businesses and to assert the same legal claims as its predecessor. On August 15, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. A hearing on the motion has not been scheduled. Expedia believes that the claims in the class action and derivative suits lack merit and will continue to vigorously defend against them. hotels.com.

(hotels.com), Mary Canales, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. hotels.com, L.P., No. DC 03 162 (District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County). The complaint, as amended, alleges that hotels.com breached its contract with its customers by charging customers taxes that exceed the amount required by or paid to the applicable taxing authorities and by charging customers fees that do not correspond to any specific services provided.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents and travel service providers. We make available, on a stand alone and package basis, travel products and services provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and non travel advertisers access to a potential source 38 Table of Contents of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction based websites. For additional information about our portfolio of brands, see the disclosure set forth in Part I, Item 1, Business, under the caption Management Overview. All percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers. Trends The travel industry, including offline agencies, online agencies and suppliers of travel products and services, has been characterized by intense competition, as well as rapid and significant change. In addition, beginning in late 2008, global economic and financial market conditions worsened markedly, creating uncertainty for travelers and suppliers. This macroeconomic downturn has pressured discretionary spending on travel and advertising, with initial weakness in the United States and the United Kingdom markets increasing and spreading to all geographies. Although recent macroeconomic trends have been generally stable to slightly improving, unemployment remains at historically high levels and consumer spending remains pressured. As such, our near term visibility remains limited. In late April 2009, the World Health Organization acknowledged an outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1), which was categorized as a pandemic in June 2009, with reported cases in Mexico and eight other countries. In response, travel advisories were issued by several countries against non essential travel, primarily to Mexico. Expedia observed an increase in cancellation activity from both customers traveling to higher risk destinations and customers in APAC regions, which have a heightened sensitivity to virus risk. However, the pandemic does not seem to have intensified, and any related cancellation activity has abated. Airline Sector The airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil. U.S. airlines responded to chronic overcapacity, financial losses and extreme volatility in oil prices by aggressively reducing their cost structures and seating capacities. Reduced seating capacities are generally negative for Expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites, and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms, car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers. Most carriers aggressively reduced capacities in 2008 and 2009, and at this time, plans for re visiting capacity expansion in 2010 appear to be relatively limited. In 2008, many carriers raised their per seat yields by increasing fares, assessing fuel surcharges and increasing the use of a la carte pricing for such items as baggage, food and beverage and preferred seating. To a large degree, the use of ancillary fees to supplement revenues have remained, and in some cases been expanded. However, as overall travel demand waned at the end of 2008 and into 2009, carriers began lowering ticket prices in order to attract more leisure travelers. Expedia generally favors a low fare environment, as low fares tend to encourage leisure travel, leave more of the travel budget for hotel spend and because our air revenues are tied principally to ticket volumes, not prices. Hence, the 2009 fare environment was a favorable one for Expedia, as airfares on tickets sold by Expedia decreased 15% in 2009. More recently, however, given the stabilization in the macro economy and aggressive capacity reductions, carriers have been cutting fares less aggressively. In the fourth quarter of 2009, fares were down just 4%, and our expectations are for fares to begin growing again in 2010. In addition to capacity and pricing actions, carriers have responded to industry conditions by aggressively reducing costs in every aspect of their operations, including distribution costs. Prior to 2008, airlines lowered (and in some cases, eliminated) travel agent commissions and overrides, and increased direct distribution through their proprietary websites. Carriers also reduced payments to GDS intermediaries, which have historically passed on a portion of these payments to large travel agents, including Expedia. In 2009, Expedia.com and other major online travel agencies began offering air tickets to consumers without an associated online booking fee, matching the airline supplier sites, which also do not charge online booking fees. Expedia has broadened this fee elimination to many of its international websites, as well as removed most 39 Table of Contents change/cancel fees in excess of those charged by travel suppliers. These fee actions, combined with the above reductions in distribution costs, have combined to reduce Expedias global revenue per ticket by over 30% in the past three years. As a result of the above industry dynamics and the strength of our other product lines, in 2009 air revenue constituted just 12% of our global revenues. We may encounter additional pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew in 2010 and beyond, and as air carriers and GDSs re negotiate their long term agreements in 2011. In addition to the above challenges, larger carriers participating in the Expedia marketplace have generally reduced their share of total air seat capacity, while leading low cost carriers such as Southwest in the United States have increased their relative capacities, but have generally chosen not to participate in the Expedia marketplace. This trend has negatively impacted our ability to obtain supply in our air business, and increased the relative attractiveness of other online and offline sales channels. Hotel Sector In 2008, the hotel sector witnessed supply growth and slowing demand, resulting in declining occupancy rates. ADR growth, which had been robust in 2006 and 2007, slowed considerably throughout 2008, and by the end of the year had stopped growing entirely. Some key leisure travel markets for Expedia, such as Las Vegas and Hawaii, have experienced dramatic year on year declines in ADRs. In 2009, we experienced a 15% decline in global ADRs due primarily to weak travel demand and continued supply expansion. While lower occupancies have historically increased the availability of discounted hotel rooms, and a lower rate of ADR growth can positively impact underlying room night growth, lower ADRs also decrease our revenue per room night as our remuneration varies proportionally with the room price. Revenue per room night in 2009 declined 17% primarily due to the downward movement in ADRs as well as adverse movements in foreign exchange rates and lower fees. In 2009, the industry declines in occupancies and ADRs were more severe than those experienced after the 9/11 terror events. And although ADRs appear to have stabilized somewhat throughout 2009, they are still expected to be down in the low to mid single digits for at least the first half of 2010. These trends, combined with softer demand in a weakening economy and lower air capacity into our core leisure travel destinations, create a challenging backdrop for our hotel business, which generates nearly two thirds of our worldwide revenue and an even greater percentage of our profitability. Online Travel Increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. According to PhoCusWright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, in 2009 approximately 56% of U.S. leisure, unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online, compared with approximately 32% of European travel. Online penetration in the Asia Pacific region is estimated to lag behind that of Europe. These penetration rates have increased over the past few years, and are expected to continue growing. This significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel. This competition has intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services, and supplier growth outpaced online agency growth for several years. As a result, according to PhoCusWright, by 2009 travel supplier sites accounted for 61% of total online travel spend in the United States. More recently, due to booking fee reductions and eliminations, online agents appear to be regaining share of overall online travel spend. Our visibility on whether these share gains continue once we pass the anniversary of the fee actions in late 2010 is limited. Differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed dramatically in the past several years, and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive, with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on features other than price. Competitive entrants such as metasearch companies have in some 40 Table of Contents cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies; although in most cases they are not providing actual travel booking services. Some of these competitors have raised significant amounts of capital and have begun to aggressively market their service offerings. In early 2009, TripAdvisor.com launched a competitive metasearch travel offering featuring a Fee Estimator enabling customers to see the price of their flight including various airline fees such as baggage charges. The online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. In particular, the agency hotel model has seen rapid adoption in Europe, and Expedia has only recently introduced a competitive offering. While agency hotel is an important component of our European strategy, we expect it will take time to gain traction with incremental hotel suppliers, and for Expedia to drive meaningful demand to those hotels. Intense competition has also historically led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries, and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins. In 2009, we experienced a reversal of these trends due to several factors including the softer macro environment, lower ad rates and a pullback in spend by some of our online competitors impacted by lower fee revenues, but there can be no assurance that reversal will continue in the future. Strategy We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for leisure, unmanaged business or managed business travelers. We are committed to providing travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging Expedias critical assets our brand portfolio, technology and content innovation, global reach and breadth of product offering. In addition, we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations, activities, suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings. A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows: Portfolio of Travel Brands. We seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers, suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industry leading brands. We target several different demographics, from the value conscious traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a high touch, customized vacation package through our Classic Vacations brand. We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higher end travel packages. Our hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews. In the United States, hotels.com generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations, and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone. Through Egencia, we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Further, our TripAdvisor Media Network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and user generated content. We believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models, allowing them to offer their products and services to the industrys broadest range of travelers using our various agency, merchant and advertising business models. We intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio, geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers. Technology and Content Innovation. Expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation, from Expedia.coms inception as a division of Microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as Expedias introduction of its Expedia Easy Manage program, offering smaller properties in secondary and 41 Table of Contents tertiary markets in Europe and Asia Pacific through an agency model hotel program, Media Solutions introduction of rich media display ads called StorePoint Expandables, TripAdvisors launch of its Family Vacation Critic, which offers reviews of kid friendly and parent tested hotels, resorts, attractions and destinations to help parents select the best family vacation, and FlipKeys launch of self service listings for vacation property owners to merchandise their offerings. We intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience, supplier integration and presentation, platform improvements, search engine marketing and search engine optimization. Global Reach. Our Expedia, hotels.com and TripAdvisor Media Network brands operate both in North America and internationally. We also offer Chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in eLong and through our TripAdvisor brands daodao.com and kuxun.cn, and we offer hotels to European based travelers through our wholly owned subsidiary Venere, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, approximately 34% of our worldwide gross bookings and 37% of worldwide revenue were international. Egencia, our corporate travel business, operates in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region using direct points of sale as well as strategic partnerships. We believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees travel experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of Egencia. In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings, as well as proprietary and user generated content for travelers. Our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers. As an example, our traveler review feature whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites. In addition, our increasing scale enhances our websites appeal to travel and non travel advertisers. We intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale. We anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce. Future launches may occur under any of our brands, or through acquisition of third party brands, as in the case of eLong, Venere, Kuxun and Egencia. Breadth of Product Offering. We offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time. Travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer, including via our 24/7 1 800 telesales service, which is an integral part of the Companys appeal to travelers. Over 60% of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations, with less than 15% of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets. We facilitate travel products and services either as stand alone products or as part of package transactions. We have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and packages businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction; however, we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our Venere brand as well as our Expedia and hotel.com brands. We also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental, destination services, cruise and other product offerings. We have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as increasing advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as Expedia.com and hotels.com, which have historically been focused on transaction revenue. In 2009, advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 11% of worldwide revenue. 42 Table of Contents Seasonality We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For more information on each of these policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below. Accounting for Certain Merchant Revenue We accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and contract terms. Actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior. Marketing Promotions We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services, which include inducement offers. Inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers, and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used. 43 Table of Contents Loyalty Program Accruals We offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers, such as our hotels.com welcomerewards program. Welcomerewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. As travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions. We determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including: (i) the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed, and (ii) an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products, which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques. The actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates. Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis. In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the Companys total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument. Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Definite Lived Intangible Assets. We review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an 44 Table of Contents asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. For additional information about our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2008, see Note 5 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. Other Long Term Liabilities Various Legal and Tax Contingencies. We record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. Occupancy Tax. Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations. Generally, hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer 45 Table of Contents payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. Certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. We note that there are more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in the United States, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. Rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and e commerce. It is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations. We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Stock Based Compensation In the first quarter of 2009, we awarded stock options as our primary form of employee stock based compensation. We measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the Black Scholes option valuation model. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the remaining term on a straight line basis. The Black Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term. If any of the assumptions used in the Black Scholes model change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. We record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stock based awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the type of award, the employee class and historical experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. New Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Segments Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we have three reportable segments: Leisure, the TripAdvisor Media Network and Egencia. The change from two reportable segments, North America and Europe, was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands. We determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. 46 Table of Contents Our Leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including: Expedia.com and hotels.com in the United States and localized Expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, Expedia Affiliate Network, Hotwire.com, Venere, eLong and Classic Vacations. Our TripAdvisor Media Network segment provides advertising services to travel suppliers on its websites, which aggregate traveler opinions and unbiased travel articles about cities, hotels, restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through tripadvisor.com and its localized international versions as well as through its various travel media content properties within the TripAdvisor Media Network. Our Egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. Reclassifications During the first quarter of 2009, our development and information technology teams were effectively combined to better support our global brands. As a result of our reorganization, in addition to costs to develop and maintain our website and internal use applications, technology and content expense now also includes the majority of information technology costs such as costs to support and operate our network and back office applications (including related data center costs), system monitoring and network security, and other technology leadership and support functions. The most significant reclassification of costs occurred between general and administrative expense and technology and content expense as, historically, a significant portion of the information technology costs were within general and administrative expense. Technology costs to operate our live site and call center applications in production remained in cost of revenue. For a detail of the amounts reclassified for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Metrics Our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating Expedia. Gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds. As travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements, we have seen our gross bookings increase, reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions. Revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. Gross Bookings and Revenue Margin Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Gross Bookings Leisure $ 20,428 $ 19,749 $ 18,324 3 % 8 % TripAdvisor Media Network(1) N/A N/A Egencia 1,383 1,520 1,308 (9 )% 16 % Total gross bookings $ 21,811 $ 21,269 $ 19,632 3 % 8 % Revenue Margin Leisure 12.9 % 13.3 % 13.4 % TripAdvisor Media Network(1) N/A N/A N/A Egencia 7.8 % 7.2 % 7.0 % Total revenue margin(1) 13.6 % 13.8 % 13.6 % 47 Table of Contents (1) The TripAdvisor Media Network, which is comprised of media businesses that differ from our transaction based websites and our Egencia business, does not have associated gross bookings or revenue margin. However, third party revenue from the TripAdvisor Media Network is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin. The increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an 18% growth in transactions, substantially offset by lower prices for airline tickets and hotel room nights. The increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and travel product prices. The decrease in revenue margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the reduction in traveler fees, the impact of our loyalty programs and a greater mix of lower margin hotels, partially offset by lower air ticket prices and a reduction in the mix of lower margin air product. The increase in revenue margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue. Results of Operations Revenue Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Revenue by Segment Leisure $ 2,635 $ 2,626 $ 2,449 0 % 7 % TripAdvisor Media Network (Third party revenue) 212 201 125 6 % 60 % Egencia 108 110 91 (1 )% 20 % Total revenue $ 2,955 $ 2,937 $ 2,665 1 % 10 % In 2009, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases within our Leisure segment in hotel, car and advertising and media revenue and an increase within our TripAdvisor Media Segment in advertising and media revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in air revenue. Worldwide hotel revenue increased 2% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 23% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of packages and room nights booked through Venere (which we acquired in September 2008), partially offset by a 17% decline in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night declined largely due to a 15% decrease in ADRs, including a reduction in traveler fees. Excluding room nights stayed through Venere, room nights grew 20% for the year. Worldwide air revenue decreased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 24% decrease in revenue per air ticket, partially offset by a 15% increase in ticket volumes. Expedia.com eliminated consumer booking fees on online air tickets in March 2009, with certain other points of sale following at various dates into the third quarter of 2009, which primarily drove the decline in revenue per ticket. This elimination of fees on Expedia.com and other points of sale, combined with lower average ticket prices, contributed to the increase in our air ticketing volumes. Worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above, which includes advertising and media, car rental, destination services and agency cruise, increased by 5% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue. In 2008, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue. Worldwide hotel revenue increased 6% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to a 13% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages, partially offset 48 Table of Contents by a 6% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night decreased due to changes in foreign exchange rates and a 2% decrease in worldwide ADRs. Worldwide air revenue increased 2% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 2% increase in revenue per air ticket. Tickets sold were flat for the year as an 8% growth in the first half of the year was offset by an 8% decline in the second half of the year due to lower passenger volumes as a result of carrier capacity cuts and softer consumer demand. Our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue discussed above increased by 29% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increases in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue. In addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion, our revenue by business model is as follows: Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Revenue by Business Model Merchant $ 2,005 $ 2,004 $ 1,915 0 % 5 % Agency 639 651 567 (2 )% 15 % Advertising and media 311 282 183 10 % 55 % Total revenue $ 2,955 $ 2,937 $ 2,665 1 % 10 % Our merchant revenue for 2009 compared to 2008 was relatively flat as increases in car revenue were offset by decreases in air revenue. The increase in merchant revenue for 2008 compared to 2007 was driven by an increase in hotel revenue primarily due to higher room nights stayed, partially offset by lower ADRs. Agency revenue decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease in air revenue primarily resulting from our Expedia.com U.S. booking fee removal and decreased agency package revenue, partially offset by higher hotel revenue related to Venere and higher car revenue. Agency revenue increased for 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in air, hotel and car revenue. Advertising and media revenue increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 21% increase in advertising revenue at our Leisure transaction based websites as well as a 6% increase at TripAdvisor Media Network. Advertising and media revenue increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased revenue at TripAdvisor Media Network. Cost of Revenue Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Customer operations $ 293 $ 295 $ 267 (1 )% 11 % Credit card processing 178 200 189 (11 )% 6 % Data center and other 136 144 109 (5 )% 31 % Total cost of revenue $ 607 $ 639 $ 565 (5 )% 13 % % of revenue 20.5 % 21.7 % 21.2 % Cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) customer operations, including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors, (2) credit card processing, including merchant fees, charge backs and fraud, and (3) other costs, primarily including data center costs to support our websites, certain promotions, destination supply, and stock based compensation. In 2009, the primary drivers of the decrease in cost of revenue expense were a decrease in credit card processing costs as a result of our technology investments, lower promotions expense and air fulfillment efficiencies primarily resulting from bringing some of our air ticket fulfillment operations in house. We expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010. 49 Table of Contents In 2008, the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were an increase in customer operation costs primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes during 2008 versus 2007, an increase of credit card processing fees due to the increase in merchant bookings and an increase in promotions expense. Selling and Marketing Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Direct costs $ 747 $ 826 $ 762 (10 )% 8 % Indirect costs 280 279 233 0 % 20 % Total selling and marketing $ 1,027 $ 1,105 $ 995 (7 )% 11 % % of revenue 34.8 % 37.6 % 37.3 % Selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs, including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals, television, radio and print spending, private label and affiliate program commissions, public relations and other costs. The remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs, including personnel and related overhead in our Partner Services Group (PSG), the TripAdvisor Media Network, Egencia and Expedia Local Expert and stock based compensation costs. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $78 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower offline brand spending for our global websites, lower online spend as well as lower private label and affiliate expenses associated with the lower overall travel demand environment. Offline and online advertising spend decreased primarily as a result of a lower cost advertising environment, our investments in search engine optimization and marketing, and costs for other customer value enhancements that stimulate demand but do not impact selling and marketing expense such as fee reductions and loyalty programs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct costs for Venere. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase as a percentage of revenue in 2010 in part due to approximately $20 million in relocation and other costs related to the opening of a global headquarters for our lodging supply group. In 2008, selling and marketing expense increased $110 million primarily due to a $64 million increase in direct costs resulting from an increase in online marketing primarily driven by increase spend related to the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network as well as increased expenses at our international points of sale, offset slight by a decrease in other direct marketing. Indirect costs included in selling and marketing expense increased $46 million primarily due to increased headcount in the TripAdvisor Media Network, PSG, Egencia and European points of sale. Technology and Content Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Personnel and overhead $ 167 $ 156 $ 144 7 % 9 % Depreciation and amortization of technology assets 68 48 35 42 % 37 % Other 85 84 67 2 % 24 % Total technology and content $ 320 $ 288 $ 246 11 % 17 % % of revenue 10.8 % 9.8 % 9.2 % Technology and content expense includes product development and content expense, as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure, back office applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks, and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead, depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware, and purchased and internally developed software, and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stock based compensation. 50 Table of Contents The year over year increase of $32 million in technology and content expense in 2009 was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets as well as increased incentive compensation expense. We expect technology and content expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010. The year over year increase of $42 million in 2008 was primarily due to increased personnel related expenses primarily in our higher growth businesses, including the TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as an increase in the amortization of software development costs. General and Administrative Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Personnel and overhead $ 158 $ 154 $ 138 3 % 11 % Professional fees 74 58 58 26 % 0 % Other 58 57 56 3 % 1 % Total general and administrative $ 290 $ 269 $ 252 8 % 6 % % of revenue 9.8 % 9.1 % 9.5 % General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related costs, including our executive leadership, finance, legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal, tax and accounting, and other costs including stock based compensation. In 2009, the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal fees, settlements and other professional fees of $16 million, including costs related to the consumer class action lawsuit and occupancy tax matters, as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased incentive compensation expense. We expect general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010. In 2008, the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in personnel and overhead costs of $16 million. Personnel and overhead costs increased due to increased headcount related to the continued expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network and European points of sale, including through acquisitions such as Venere, as well as higher incentive compensation at certain points of sale. Amortization of Intangible Assets Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Amortization of intangible assets $ 38 $ 69 $ 78 (46 )% (10 )% % of revenue 1.3 % 2.4 % 2.9 % In 2009 and 2008, the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain technology and supplier relationship intangible assets, partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions. In 2009, the completion of amortization related to certain distribution agreements also contributed to the decrease. For additional information about our acquisitions, see Note 3 Acquisitions and Other Investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Occupancy Tax Assessments and Legal Reserves During 2009, we recognized $48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the San Francisco occupancy tax proceedings and an accrual of $19 million for the estimated settlement cost of the Expedia consumer class action lawsuit. For additional information, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges During 2009, in conjunction with the reorganization of our business around our global brands, and the resulting centralization of locations and brand management, marketing and administrative personnel as well as certain customer operations centers, we recognized $34 million in restructuring charges. These charges were primarily related to employee severance and related benefits. Restructuring charges related to the brand reorganization were substantially completed by the end of 2009. For additional information, see Note 12 Restructuring Charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long lived Assets In 2008, we recorded impairments of approximately $3 billion of long term assets, which consisted of $2.8 billion of goodwill, $223 million of intangible assets and $11 million related to capitalized software. Impaired intangible assets consisted of certain of our indefinite lived trade names. For additional information about our impairments, see Note 5 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements. We recorded no such impairments in 2009. Operating Income (Loss) Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Operating income (loss) $ 571 $ (2,429 ) $ 529 N/A N/A % of revenue 19.3 % (82.7 )% 19.9 % In 2009, the change to operating income was due to the prior year impairment of long term assets of approximately $3 billion. In addition, selling and marketing expense and cost of revenue decreased compared to the increase in revenue, partially offset by the San Francisco occupancy tax assessments, restructuring charges and class action settlement legal reserve as well as growth in technology and content and general and administrative expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth. In 2008, the recording of a significant operating loss and the resulting year over year decline was due to the impairment of long term assets of approximately $3 billion. Interest Income and Expense Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Interest income $ 6 $ 30 $ 39 (80 )% (23 )% Interest expense (84 ) (72 ) (53 ) 17 % 36 % Interest income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower average interest rates. Interest expense increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily resulting from interest on the $400 million senior unsecured notes issued in June 2008. The increase in 2009 was partially offset by lower interest expense related to our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our long term indebtedness totaled $895 million, $1.545 billion and $1.085 billion. 52 Table of Contents Other, net Other, net is comprised of the following: Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Foreign exchange rate losses, net $ (30 ) $ (47 ) $ (22 ) (37 )% 114 % Noncontrolling investment basis adjustment (5 ) N/A N/A Gain (loss) on derivative instruments assumed at Spin Off 5 (6 ) (101 )% (180 )% Federal excise tax refunds 12 N/A (100 )% Other (2 ) (3 ) (84 )% (43 )% Total other, net $ (35 ) $ (44 ) $ (19 ) (20 )% 137 % In 2008, in connection with the closing of an acquisition and the related holding of euros to economically hedge the purchase price, we recognized a net loss of $21 million, included in foreign exchange rate losses, net. In 2007, we recognized a $12 million gain related to federal excise tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 154 $ 6 $ 203 N/A (97 )% Effective tax rate 33.7 % (0.2 )% 40.9 % In 2009, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% federal statutory rate primarily due to a fourth quarter deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary, partially offset by state income taxes. The change in the 2009 effective rate compared to the 2008 rate was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill in 2008, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes. Absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 41.5%, and our 2009 effective rate was lower than this rate primarily due to the deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary and, to a lesser extent, lower accruals related to uncertain tax positions. We expect our effective tax rate to benefit in 2010 and beyond based on changes in our business structure combined with the relative growth in our international business. In 2008, our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory rate and the 2007 effective rate due to the impairment of goodwill, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes. Absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 41.5%, which was higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax positions and higher than our 2007 rate primarily due to higher accruals related to uncertain tax positions. In 2007, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, taxes related to our foreign operations and non deductible losses related to our derivative liabilities. Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations; our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $688 million and $758 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, including $148 million and $145 million of cash and short term investment balances of majority owned subsidiaries; and our revolving credit facility. 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a $1 billion revolving credit facility of which $958 million was available. This represents the total $1 billion facility less $42 million of outstanding stand by letters of credit (LOC). During 2009, we amended our credit facility to replace our tangible net worth covenant with a minimum interest coverage covenant, among other changes. As part of this amendment, our leverage ratio was tightened, pricing on our borrowings increased by 200 basis points and we paid approximately $6 million in fees. Outstanding credit facility borrowings bore interest reflecting our financial leverage. Based on our December 31, 2009 financial statements, the interest rate would equate to a base rate plus 262.5 basis points. At our discretion, we could choose a base rate equal to (1) the greater of the Prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or LIBOR plus 100 basis points or (2) various durations of LIBOR. In February 2010, we reached agreement on a new $750 million, three year revolving credit facility, replacing our prior credit facility. Pricing is based on the Companys credit ratings, with drawn amounts bearing interest at LIBOR plus 300 basis points, and undrawn amounts bearing interest at 50 basis points. Financial covenants remain the same under the new facility. We incurred approximately $8 million in fees, which will be amortized over the life of the credit facility. We currently have no borrowings outstanding under the facility. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. In October 2009, our long term ratings from Moodys and Standard and Poors were raised to Ba1 and BBB , respectively. Both agencies issued a stable ratings outlook at that time. Changes in our operating results, cash flows, or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. Should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. On February 10, 2010, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of outstanding common stock, the first dividend in our history. Future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination of our Board of Directors. Based on our current shares outstanding, we estimate this quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $20 million. Under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction, but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed. For most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant hotel business, we pay after the travelers use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. As long as the merchant hotel business grows, we expect that changes in working capital will positively impact operating cash flows. If this business model declines relative to our other businesses, or if there are changes to the model or booking patterns which compress the time of receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers, our working capital benefits could be reduced. Seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows. During the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. During the second half of the year, this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative. While we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue, merchant hotel growth rates or changes to the model or booking patterns as discussed above may affect working capital, which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations. As of December 31, 2009, we had a deficit in our working capital of $610 million, compared to a deficit of $367 million as of December 31, 2008 primarily due to the repayment of $650 million of borrowings under our credit facility and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations during 2009. We continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations. Ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure, which include our servers, networking equipment and software, release improvements to our software code and search engine marketing and optimization efforts. Our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions, share repurchases or expenditures in support of our business strategy. In the event we have acquisitions or share repurchases, this may reduce our cash balance and or increase our debt. 54 Table of Contents Our cash flows are as follows: Year ended December 31, $ Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 (In millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 676 $ 521 $ 712 $ 155 $ (191 ) Investing activities (48 ) (860 ) (180 ) 812 (680 ) Financing activities (660 ) 465 (790 ) (1,125 ) 1,255 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 9 (78 ) 22 87 (100 ) In 2009, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $155 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes and growth in operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in income tax and interest payments as well as occupancy tax assessments. In 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $191 million primarily due to a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in tax payments and faster invoice and payment processing for our hotel suppliers. In connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments, certain jurisdictions may assert that taxpayers are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances, which is referred to as pay to play. These jurisdictions may also attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of similar tax ordinances. Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we will continue to defend our position vigorously. During 2009, we paid $48 million related to tax assessments in San Francisco. In 2009, cash used in investing activities represented a positive change of $812 million in cash flows primarily due to a $493 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, cash provided by the net maturities of short term investments of $47 million in 2009 compared to $93 million in purchases in 2008 and a decrease in capital expenditures of $68 million. In 2008, cash used in investing activities increased by $680 million primarily due to a $479 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions, including $93 million as a contingent payment for the financial performance of a company we acquired during 2007, as well as the purchase of short term investments of $93 million by eLong and an increase in capital expenditures of $73 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily included the repayment of $650 million of borrowings under the credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily included $457 million of net borrowings of debt. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares in two tender offers where we acquired 55 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $1.385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offers. In addition, we paid withholding taxes for stock option exercises of $121 million on behalf of our Chairman and Senior Executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled. These were offset in part by $585 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility, $55 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $96 million in excess tax benefits on equity awards, of which approximately $92 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our Chairman and Senior Executive. In June 2008, we privately placed $400 million of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due in July 2016 (the 8.5% Notes). The 8.5% Notes were issued at 98.572% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized over their life. Interest is payable semi annually in January and July of each year, beginning January 1, 2009. We used the proceeds, net of the discount and issuance costs, of $392 million to repay the then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $330 million with the remaining cash was used for general corporate purposes. The effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2009 showed a net increase of $87 million primarily due to the relative appreciation in foreign currencies during 2009 compared to their depreciation in 2008. 55 Table of Contents The effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2008 showed a net decrease of $100 million primarily due to a sharp depreciation in foreign currencies during the second half of 2008 compared with appreciating foreign currencies throughout 2007, and included a $21 million loss related to euro cash holdings during the third quarter of 2008 to economically hedge the purchase price of an acquisition. We currently have authorization, for which there is no fixed termination date, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock; no such repurchases have been made under this authorization. The number of shares we may make under this authorization is subject to certain of our debt covenants. We also have a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which Expedia, Inc. may offer from time to time debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants. The shelf registration statement expires on October 15, 2010. In our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs. Our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the credit market disruptions, which were more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009. There can be no assurance, however, that future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009: By Period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years (In millions) Long term debt(1) $ 1,474 $ 71 $ 143 $ 143 $ 1,117 Operating leases(2) 231 38 69 55 69 Purchase obligations(3) 58 32 26 Guarantees(4) 65 65 Letters of credit(4) 42 42 Total(5) $ 1,870 $ 248 $ 238 $ 198 $ 1,186 (1) Our 8.5% Notes and 7.456% Notes include interest payments through maturity in 2016 and 2018, respectively, based on the stated fixed rates. In the above table, we have reflected the 7.456% Notes based on the maturity date in 2018; however such Notes are repayable in whole or in part on August 15, 2013 at the option of the holders. (2) The operating leases are for office space and related office equipment. We account for these leases on a monthly basis. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal options. Operating lease obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2018. (3) Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. (4) Guarantees and LOCs are commitments that represent funding responsibilities that may require our performance in the event of third party demands or contingent events. We use our stand by LOCs primarily to secure payment for hotel room transactions to particular hotel properties. The outstanding balance of our stand by LOCs directly reduces the amount available to us from our revolving credit facility. The LOC amounts in the above table represent the amount of commitment expiration per period. In addition, we provide a guarantee to the aviation authority of one country to protect against potential non delivery of our packaged travel services sold within that country. This country holds all travel agents and tour companies to the same standard. 56 Table of Contents (5) Excludes $190 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. Other than the items described above, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2009. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions For a discussion of certain relationships and related party transactions, see Note 15 Related Party Transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Management Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our exposure to market risk includes our long term debt, our revolving credit facility, derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk In June 2008, we issued $400 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 8.5%. In August 2006, we issued $500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7.456%. As a result, if market interest rates decline, our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. The fair values of our 8.5% Notes and our 7.456% Notes were approximately $431 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2009 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 8.5% Notes by approximately $11 million and our 7.456% Notes by approximately $18 million. In July 2005, we entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility. Interest on the facility was determined by market interest rates plus a spread based on our financial leverage. In February 2010, we entered into a new $750 million revolving credit facility, which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. Because our interest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our outstanding borrowing under the prior revolving credit facility were $0 and $650 million. We currently have no borrowings outstanding under the new facility. We did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in Australia, Canada, China and the European Union. Because we operate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. To the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally, during 2008, we began using foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue 57 Table of Contents exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash and accounts receivable for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency denominated operating liabilities. These instruments are typically short term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a net forward asset of less than $1 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of $1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges. Future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing, through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts, such exposures. As an example, if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10% against the U.S. dollar, we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $1 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures) and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of December 31, 2009. As the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of $30 million ($20 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), $47 million, and $22 million. As we increase our operations in international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. The economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies. Part II. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents and travel service providers. We make available, on a stand alone and package basis, travel products and services provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and non travel advertisers access to a potential source 38 Table of Contents of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction based websites. For additional information about our portfolio of brands, see the disclosure set forth in Part I, Item 1, Business, under the caption Management Overview. All percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers. Trends The travel industry, including offline agencies, online agencies and suppliers of travel products and services, has been characterized by intense competition, as well as rapid and significant change. In addition, beginning in late 2008, global economic and financial market conditions worsened markedly, creating uncertainty for travelers and suppliers. This macroeconomic downturn has pressured discretionary spending on travel and advertising, with initial weakness in the United States and the United Kingdom markets increasing and spreading to all geographies. Although recent macroeconomic trends have been generally stable to slightly improving, unemployment remains at historically high levels and consumer spending remains pressured. As such, our near term visibility remains limited. In late April 2009, the World Health Organization acknowledged an outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1), which was categorized as a pandemic in June 2009, with reported cases in Mexico and eight other countries. In response, travel advisories were issued by several countries against non essential travel, primarily to Mexico. Expedia observed an increase in cancellation activity from both customers traveling to higher risk destinations and customers in APAC regions, which have a heightened sensitivity to virus risk. However, the pandemic does not seem to have intensified, and any related cancellation activity has abated. Airline Sector The airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil. U.S. airlines responded to chronic overcapacity, financial losses and extreme volatility in oil prices by aggressively reducing their cost structures and seating capacities. Reduced seating capacities are generally negative for Expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites, and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms, car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers. Most carriers aggressively reduced capacities in 2008 and 2009, and at this time, plans for re visiting capacity expansion in 2010 appear to be relatively limited. In 2008, many carriers raised their per seat yields by increasing fares, assessing fuel surcharges and increasing the use of a la carte pricing for such items as baggage, food and beverage and preferred seating. To a large degree, the use of ancillary fees to supplement revenues have remained, and in some cases been expanded. However, as overall travel demand waned at the end of 2008 and into 2009, carriers began lowering ticket prices in order to attract more leisure travelers. Expedia generally favors a low fare environment, as low fares tend to encourage leisure travel, leave more of the travel budget for hotel spend and because our air revenues are tied principally to ticket volumes, not prices. Hence, the 2009 fare environment was a favorable one for Expedia, as airfares on tickets sold by Expedia decreased 15% in 2009. More recently, however, given the stabilization in the macro economy and aggressive capacity reductions, carriers have been cutting fares less aggressively. In the fourth quarter of 2009, fares were down just 4%, and our expectations are for fares to begin growing again in 2010. In addition to capacity and pricing actions, carriers have responded to industry conditions by aggressively reducing costs in every aspect of their operations, including distribution costs. Prior to 2008, airlines lowered (and in some cases, eliminated) travel agent commissions and overrides, and increased direct distribution through their proprietary websites. Carriers also reduced payments to GDS intermediaries, which have historically passed on a portion of these payments to large travel agents, including Expedia. In 2009, Expedia.com and other major online travel agencies began offering air tickets to consumers without an associated online booking fee, matching the airline supplier sites, which also do not charge online booking fees. Expedia has broadened this fee elimination to many of its international websites, as well as removed most 39 Table of Contents change/cancel fees in excess of those charged by travel suppliers. These fee actions, combined with the above reductions in distribution costs, have combined to reduce Expedias global revenue per ticket by over 30% in the past three years. As a result of the above industry dynamics and the strength of our other product lines, in 2009 air revenue constituted just 12% of our global revenues. We may encounter additional pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew in 2010 and beyond, and as air carriers and GDSs re negotiate their long term agreements in 2011. In addition to the above challenges, larger carriers participating in the Expedia marketplace have generally reduced their share of total air seat capacity, while leading low cost carriers such as Southwest in the United States have increased their relative capacities, but have generally chosen not to participate in the Expedia marketplace. This trend has negatively impacted our ability to obtain supply in our air business, and increased the relative attractiveness of other online and offline sales channels. Hotel Sector In 2008, the hotel sector witnessed supply growth and slowing demand, resulting in declining occupancy rates. ADR growth, which had been robust in 2006 and 2007, slowed considerably throughout 2008, and by the end of the year had stopped growing entirely. Some key leisure travel markets for Expedia, such as Las Vegas and Hawaii, have experienced dramatic year on year declines in ADRs. In 2009, we experienced a 15% decline in global ADRs due primarily to weak travel demand and continued supply expansion. While lower occupancies have historically increased the availability of discounted hotel rooms, and a lower rate of ADR growth can positively impact underlying room night growth, lower ADRs also decrease our revenue per room night as our remuneration varies proportionally with the room price. Revenue per room night in 2009 declined 17% primarily due to the downward movement in ADRs as well as adverse movements in foreign exchange rates and lower fees. In 2009, the industry declines in occupancies and ADRs were more severe than those experienced after the 9/11 terror events. And although ADRs appear to have stabilized somewhat throughout 2009, they are still expected to be down in the low to mid single digits for at least the first half of 2010. These trends, combined with softer demand in a weakening economy and lower air capacity into our core leisure travel destinations, create a challenging backdrop for our hotel business, which generates nearly two thirds of our worldwide revenue and an even greater percentage of our profitability. Online Travel Increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. According to PhoCusWright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, in 2009 approximately 56% of U.S. leisure, unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online, compared with approximately 32% of European travel. Online penetration in the Asia Pacific region is estimated to lag behind that of Europe. These penetration rates have increased over the past few years, and are expected to continue growing. This significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel. This competition has intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services, and supplier growth outpaced online agency growth for several years. As a result, according to PhoCusWright, by 2009 travel supplier sites accounted for 61% of total online travel spend in the United States. More recently, due to booking fee reductions and eliminations, online agents appear to be regaining share of overall online travel spend. Our visibility on whether these share gains continue once we pass the anniversary of the fee actions in late 2010 is limited. Differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed dramatically in the past several years, and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive, with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on features other than price. Competitive entrants such as metasearch companies have in some 40 Table of Contents cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies; although in most cases they are not providing actual travel booking services. Some of these competitors have raised significant amounts of capital and have begun to aggressively market their service offerings. In early 2009, TripAdvisor.com launched a competitive metasearch travel offering featuring a Fee Estimator enabling customers to see the price of their flight including various airline fees such as baggage charges. The online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. In particular, the agency hotel model has seen rapid adoption in Europe, and Expedia has only recently introduced a competitive offering. While agency hotel is an important component of our European strategy, we expect it will take time to gain traction with incremental hotel suppliers, and for Expedia to drive meaningful demand to those hotels. Intense competition has also historically led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries, and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins. In 2009, we experienced a reversal of these trends due to several factors including the softer macro environment, lower ad rates and a pullback in spend by some of our online competitors impacted by lower fee revenues, but there can be no assurance that reversal will continue in the future. Strategy We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for leisure, unmanaged business or managed business travelers. We are committed to providing travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging Expedias critical assets our brand portfolio, technology and content innovation, global reach and breadth of product offering. In addition, we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations, activities, suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings. A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows: Portfolio of Travel Brands. We seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers, suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industry leading brands. We target several different demographics, from the value conscious traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a high touch, customized vacation package through our Classic Vacations brand. We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higher end travel packages. Our hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews. In the United States, hotels.com generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations, and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone. Through Egencia, we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Further, our TripAdvisor Media Network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and user generated content. We believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models, allowing them to offer their products and services to the industrys broadest range of travelers using our various agency, merchant and advertising business models. We intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio, geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers. Technology and Content Innovation. Expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation, from Expedia.coms inception as a division of Microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as Expedias introduction of its Expedia Easy Manage program, offering smaller properties in secondary and 41 Table of Contents tertiary markets in Europe and Asia Pacific through an agency model hotel program, Media Solutions introduction of rich media display ads called StorePoint Expandables, TripAdvisors launch of its Family Vacation Critic, which offers reviews of kid friendly and parent tested hotels, resorts, attractions and destinations to help parents select the best family vacation, and FlipKeys launch of self service listings for vacation property owners to merchandise their offerings. We intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience, supplier integration and presentation, platform improvements, search engine marketing and search engine optimization. Global Reach. Our Expedia, hotels.com and TripAdvisor Media Network brands operate both in North America and internationally. We also offer Chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in eLong and through our TripAdvisor brands daodao.com and kuxun.cn, and we offer hotels to European based travelers through our wholly owned subsidiary Venere, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, approximately 34% of our worldwide gross bookings and 37% of worldwide revenue were international. Egencia, our corporate travel business, operates in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region using direct points of sale as well as strategic partnerships. We believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees travel experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of Egencia. In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings, as well as proprietary and user generated content for travelers. Our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers. As an example, our traveler review feature whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites. In addition, our increasing scale enhances our websites appeal to travel and non travel advertisers. We intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale. We anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce. Future launches may occur under any of our brands, or through acquisition of third party brands, as in the case of eLong, Venere, Kuxun and Egencia. Breadth of Product Offering. We offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time. Travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer, including via our 24/7 1 800 telesales service, which is an integral part of the Companys appeal to travelers. Over 60% of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations, with less than 15% of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets. We facilitate travel products and services either as stand alone products or as part of package transactions. We have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and packages businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction; however, we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our Venere brand as well as our Expedia and hotel.com brands. We also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental, destination services, cruise and other product offerings. We have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as increasing advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as Expedia.com and hotels.com, which have historically been focused on transaction revenue. In 2009, advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 11% of worldwide revenue. 42 Table of Contents Seasonality We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For more information on each of these policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below. Accounting for Certain Merchant Revenue We accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and contract terms. Actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior. Marketing Promotions We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services, which include inducement offers. Inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers, and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used. 43 Table of Contents Loyalty Program Accruals We offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers, such as our hotels.com welcomerewards program. Welcomerewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. As travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions. We determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including: (i) the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed, and (ii) an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products, which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques. The actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates. Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis. In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the Companys total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument. Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Definite Lived Intangible Assets. We review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an 44 Table of Contents asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. For additional information about our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2008, see Note 5 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. Other Long Term Liabilities Various Legal and Tax Contingencies. We record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. Occupancy Tax. Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations. Generally, hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer 45 Table of Contents payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. Certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. We note that there are more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in the United States, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. Rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and e commerce. It is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations. We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Stock Based Compensation In the first quarter of 2009, we awarded stock options as our primary form of employee stock based compensation. We measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the Black Scholes option valuation model. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the remaining term on a straight line basis. The Black Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term. If any of the assumptions used in the Black Scholes model change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. We record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stock based awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the type of award, the employee class and historical experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. New Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Segments Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we have three reportable segments: Leisure, the TripAdvisor Media Network and Egencia. The change from two reportable segments, North America and Europe, was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands. We determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. 46 Table of Contents Our Leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including: Expedia.com and hotels.com in the United States and localized Expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, Expedia Affiliate Network, Hotwire.com, Venere, eLong and Classic Vacations. Our TripAdvisor Media Network segment provides advertising services to travel suppliers on its websites, which aggregate traveler opinions and unbiased travel articles about cities, hotels, restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through tripadvisor.com and its localized international versions as well as through its various travel media content properties within the TripAdvisor Media Network. Our Egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. Reclassifications During the first quarter of 2009, our development and information technology teams were effectively combined to better support our global brands. As a result of our reorganization, in addition to costs to develop and maintain our website and internal use applications, technology and content expense now also includes the majority of information technology costs such as costs to support and operate our network and back office applications (including related data center costs), system monitoring and network security, and other technology leadership and support functions. The most significant reclassification of costs occurred between general and administrative expense and technology and content expense as, historically, a significant portion of the information technology costs were within general and administrative expense. Technology costs to operate our live site and call center applications in production remained in cost of revenue. For a detail of the amounts reclassified for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Metrics Our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating Expedia. Gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds. As travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements, we have seen our gross bookings increase, reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions. Revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. Gross Bookings and Revenue Margin Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Gross Bookings Leisure $ 20,428 $ 19,749 $ 18,324 3 % 8 % TripAdvisor Media Network(1) N/A N/A Egencia 1,383 1,520 1,308 (9 )% 16 % Total gross bookings $ 21,811 $ 21,269 $ 19,632 3 % 8 % Revenue Margin Leisure 12.9 % 13.3 % 13.4 % TripAdvisor Media Network(1) N/A N/A N/A Egencia 7.8 % 7.2 % 7.0 % Total revenue margin(1) 13.6 % 13.8 % 13.6 % 47 Table of Contents (1) The TripAdvisor Media Network, which is comprised of media businesses that differ from our transaction based websites and our Egencia business, does not have associated gross bookings or revenue margin. However, third party revenue from the TripAdvisor Media Network is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin. The increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an 18% growth in transactions, substantially offset by lower prices for airline tickets and hotel room nights. The increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and travel product prices. The decrease in revenue margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the reduction in traveler fees, the impact of our loyalty programs and a greater mix of lower margin hotels, partially offset by lower air ticket prices and a reduction in the mix of lower margin air product. The increase in revenue margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue. Results of Operations Revenue Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Revenue by Segment Leisure $ 2,635 $ 2,626 $ 2,449 0 % 7 % TripAdvisor Media Network (Third party revenue) 212 201 125 6 % 60 % Egencia 108 110 91 (1 )% 20 % Total revenue $ 2,955 $ 2,937 $ 2,665 1 % 10 % In 2009, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases within our Leisure segment in hotel, car and advertising and media revenue and an increase within our TripAdvisor Media Segment in advertising and media revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in air revenue. Worldwide hotel revenue increased 2% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 23% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of packages and room nights booked through Venere (which we acquired in September 2008), partially offset by a 17% decline in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night declined largely due to a 15% decrease in ADRs, including a reduction in traveler fees. Excluding room nights stayed through Venere, room nights grew 20% for the year. Worldwide air revenue decreased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 24% decrease in revenue per air ticket, partially offset by a 15% increase in ticket volumes. Expedia.com eliminated consumer booking fees on online air tickets in March 2009, with certain other points of sale following at various dates into the third quarter of 2009, which primarily drove the decline in revenue per ticket. This elimination of fees on Expedia.com and other points of sale, combined with lower average ticket prices, contributed to the increase in our air ticketing volumes. Worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above, which includes advertising and media, car rental, destination services and agency cruise, increased by 5% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue. In 2008, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue. Worldwide hotel revenue increased 6% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to a 13% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages, partially offset 48 Table of Contents by a 6% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night decreased due to changes in foreign exchange rates and a 2% decrease in worldwide ADRs. Worldwide air revenue increased 2% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 2% increase in revenue per air ticket. Tickets sold were flat for the year as an 8% growth in the first half of the year was offset by an 8% decline in the second half of the year due to lower passenger volumes as a result of carrier capacity cuts and softer consumer demand. Our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue discussed above increased by 29% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increases in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue. In addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion, our revenue by business model is as follows: Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Revenue by Business Model Merchant $ 2,005 $ 2,004 $ 1,915 0 % 5 % Agency 639 651 567 (2 )% 15 % Advertising and media 311 282 183 10 % 55 % Total revenue $ 2,955 $ 2,937 $ 2,665 1 % 10 % Our merchant revenue for 2009 compared to 2008 was relatively flat as increases in car revenue were offset by decreases in air revenue. The increase in merchant revenue for 2008 compared to 2007 was driven by an increase in hotel revenue primarily due to higher room nights stayed, partially offset by lower ADRs. Agency revenue decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease in air revenue primarily resulting from our Expedia.com U.S. booking fee removal and decreased agency package revenue, partially offset by higher hotel revenue related to Venere and higher car revenue. Agency revenue increased for 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in air, hotel and car revenue. Advertising and media revenue increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 21% increase in advertising revenue at our Leisure transaction based websites as well as a 6% increase at TripAdvisor Media Network. Advertising and media revenue increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased revenue at TripAdvisor Media Network. Cost of Revenue Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Customer operations $ 293 $ 295 $ 267 (1 )% 11 % Credit card processing 178 200 189 (11 )% 6 % Data center and other 136 144 109 (5 )% 31 % Total cost of revenue $ 607 $ 639 $ 565 (5 )% 13 % % of revenue 20.5 % 21.7 % 21.2 % Cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) customer operations, including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors, (2) credit card processing, including merchant fees, charge backs and fraud, and (3) other costs, primarily including data center costs to support our websites, certain promotions, destination supply, and stock based compensation. In 2009, the primary drivers of the decrease in cost of revenue expense were a decrease in credit card processing costs as a result of our technology investments, lower promotions expense and air fulfillment efficiencies primarily resulting from bringing some of our air ticket fulfillment operations in house. We expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010. 49 Table of Contents In 2008, the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were an increase in customer operation costs primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes during 2008 versus 2007, an increase of credit card processing fees due to the increase in merchant bookings and an increase in promotions expense. Selling and Marketing Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Direct costs $ 747 $ 826 $ 762 (10 )% 8 % Indirect costs 280 279 233 0 % 20 % Total selling and marketing $ 1,027 $ 1,105 $ 995 (7 )% 11 % % of revenue 34.8 % 37.6 % 37.3 % Selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs, including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals, television, radio and print spending, private label and affiliate program commissions, public relations and other costs. The remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs, including personnel and related overhead in our Partner Services Group (PSG), the TripAdvisor Media Network, Egencia and Expedia Local Expert and stock based compensation costs. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $78 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower offline brand spending for our global websites, lower online spend as well as lower private label and affiliate expenses associated with the lower overall travel demand environment. Offline and online advertising spend decreased primarily as a result of a lower cost advertising environment, our investments in search engine optimization and marketing, and costs for other customer value enhancements that stimulate demand but do not impact selling and marketing expense such as fee reductions and loyalty programs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct costs for Venere. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase as a percentage of revenue in 2010 in part due to approximately $20 million in relocation and other costs related to the opening of a global headquarters for our lodging supply group. In 2008, selling and marketing expense increased $110 million primarily due to a $64 million increase in direct costs resulting from an increase in online marketing primarily driven by increase spend related to the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network as well as increased expenses at our international points of sale, offset slight by a decrease in other direct marketing. Indirect costs included in selling and marketing expense increased $46 million primarily due to increased headcount in the TripAdvisor Media Network, PSG, Egencia and European points of sale. Technology and Content Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Personnel and overhead $ 167 $ 156 $ 144 7 % 9 % Depreciation and amortization of technology assets 68 48 35 42 % 37 % Other 85 84 67 2 % 24 % Total technology and content $ 320 $ 288 $ 246 11 % 17 % % of revenue 10.8 % 9.8 % 9.2 % Technology and content expense includes product development and content expense, as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure, back office applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks, and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead, depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware, and purchased and internally developed software, and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stock based compensation. 50 Table of Contents The year over year increase of $32 million in technology and content expense in 2009 was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets as well as increased incentive compensation expense. We expect technology and content expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010. The year over year increase of $42 million in 2008 was primarily due to increased personnel related expenses primarily in our higher growth businesses, including the TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as an increase in the amortization of software development costs. General and Administrative Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Personnel and overhead $ 158 $ 154 $ 138 3 % 11 % Professional fees 74 58 58 26 % 0 % Other 58 57 56 3 % 1 % Total general and administrative $ 290 $ 269 $ 252 8 % 6 % % of revenue 9.8 % 9.1 % 9.5 % General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related costs, including our executive leadership, finance, legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal, tax and accounting, and other costs including stock based compensation. In 2009, the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal fees, settlements and other professional fees of $16 million, including costs related to the consumer class action lawsuit and occupancy tax matters, as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased incentive compensation expense. We expect general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010. In 2008, the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in personnel and overhead costs of $16 million. Personnel and overhead costs increased due to increased headcount related to the continued expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network and European points of sale, including through acquisitions such as Venere, as well as higher incentive compensation at certain points of sale. Amortization of Intangible Assets Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Amortization of intangible assets $ 38 $ 69 $ 78 (46 )% (10 )% % of revenue 1.3 % 2.4 % 2.9 % In 2009 and 2008, the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain technology and supplier relationship intangible assets, partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions. In 2009, the completion of amortization related to certain distribution agreements also contributed to the decrease. For additional information about our acquisitions, see Note 3 Acquisitions and Other Investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Occupancy Tax Assessments and Legal Reserves During 2009, we recognized $48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the San Francisco occupancy tax proceedings and an accrual of $19 million for the estimated settlement cost of the Expedia consumer class action lawsuit. For additional information, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges During 2009, in conjunction with the reorganization of our business around our global brands, and the resulting centralization of locations and brand management, marketing and administrative personnel as well as certain customer operations centers, we recognized $34 million in restructuring charges. These charges were primarily related to employee severance and related benefits. Restructuring charges related to the brand reorganization were substantially completed by the end of 2009. For additional information, see Note 12 Restructuring Charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long lived Assets In 2008, we recorded impairments of approximately $3 billion of long term assets, which consisted of $2.8 billion of goodwill, $223 million of intangible assets and $11 million related to capitalized software. Impaired intangible assets consisted of certain of our indefinite lived trade names. For additional information about our impairments, see Note 5 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements. We recorded no such impairments in 2009. Operating Income (Loss) Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Operating income (loss) $ 571 $ (2,429 ) $ 529 N/A N/A % of revenue 19.3 % (82.7 )% 19.9 % In 2009, the change to operating income was due to the prior year impairment of long term assets of approximately $3 billion. In addition, selling and marketing expense and cost of revenue decreased compared to the increase in revenue, partially offset by the San Francisco occupancy tax assessments, restructuring charges and class action settlement legal reserve as well as growth in technology and content and general and administrative expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth. In 2008, the recording of a significant operating loss and the resulting year over year decline was due to the impairment of long term assets of approximately $3 billion. Interest Income and Expense Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Interest income $ 6 $ 30 $ 39 (80 )% (23 )% Interest expense (84 ) (72 ) (53 ) 17 % 36 % Interest income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower average interest rates. Interest expense increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily resulting from interest on the $400 million senior unsecured notes issued in June 2008. The increase in 2009 was partially offset by lower interest expense related to our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our long term indebtedness totaled $895 million, $1.545 billion and $1.085 billion. 52 Table of Contents Other, net Other, net is comprised of the following: Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Foreign exchange rate losses, net $ (30 ) $ (47 ) $ (22 ) (37 )% 114 % Noncontrolling investment basis adjustment (5 ) N/A N/A Gain (loss) on derivative instruments assumed at Spin Off 5 (6 ) (101 )% (180 )% Federal excise tax refunds 12 N/A (100 )% Other (2 ) (3 ) (84 )% (43 )% Total other, net $ (35 ) $ (44 ) $ (19 ) (20 )% 137 % In 2008, in connection with the closing of an acquisition and the related holding of euros to economically hedge the purchase price, we recognized a net loss of $21 million, included in foreign exchange rate losses, net.

Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 ($ in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 154 $ 6 $ 203 N/A (97 )% Effective tax rate 33.7 % (0.2 )% 40.9 % In 2009, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% federal statutory rate primarily due to a fourth quarter deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary, partially offset by state income taxes. The change in the 2009 effective rate compared to the 2008 rate was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill in 2008, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes. Absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 41.5%, and our 2009 effective rate was lower than this rate primarily due to the deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary and, to a lesser extent, lower accruals related to uncertain tax positions. We expect our effective tax rate to benefit in 2010 and beyond based on changes in our business structure combined with the relative growth in our international business. In 2008, our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory rate and the 2007 effective rate due to the impairment of goodwill, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes. Absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 41.5%, which was higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax positions and higher than our 2007 rate primarily due to higher accruals related to uncertain tax positions. In 2007, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, taxes related to our foreign operations and non deductible losses related to our derivative liabilities. Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations; our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $688 million and $758 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, including $148 million and $145 million of cash and short term investment balances of majority owned subsidiaries; and our revolving credit facility. 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a $1 billion revolving credit facility of which $958 million was available. This represents the total $1 billion facility less $42 million of outstanding stand by letters of credit (LOC). During 2009, we amended our credit facility to replace our tangible net worth covenant with a minimum interest coverage covenant, among other changes. As part of this amendment, our leverage ratio was tightened, pricing on our borrowings increased by 200 basis points and we paid approximately $6 million in fees. Outstanding credit facility borrowings bore interest reflecting our financial leverage. Based on our December 31, 2009 financial statements, the interest rate would equate to a base rate plus 262.5 basis points. At our discretion, we could choose a base rate equal to (1) the greater of the Prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or LIBOR plus 100 basis points or (2) various durations of LIBOR. In February 2010, we reached agreement on a new $750 million, three year revolving credit facility, replacing our prior credit facility. Pricing is based on the Companys credit ratings, with drawn amounts bearing interest at LIBOR plus 300 basis points, and undrawn amounts bearing interest at 50 basis points. Financial covenants remain the same under the new facility. We incurred approximately $8 million in fees, which will be amortized over the life of the credit facility. We currently have no borrowings outstanding under the facility. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. In October 2009, our long term ratings from Moodys and Standard and Poors were raised to Ba1 and BBB , respectively. Both agencies issued a stable ratings outlook at that time. Changes in our operating results, cash flows, or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. Should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. On February 10, 2010, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of outstanding common stock, the first dividend in our history. Future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination of our Board of Directors. Based on our current shares outstanding, we estimate this quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $20 million. Under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction, but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed. For most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant hotel business, we pay after the travelers use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. As long as the merchant hotel business grows, we expect that changes in working capital will positively impact operating cash flows. If this business model declines relative to our other businesses, or if there are changes to the model or booking patterns which compress the time of receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers, our working capital benefits could be reduced. Seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows. During the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. During the second half of the year, this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative. While we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue, merchant hotel growth rates or changes to the model or booking patterns as discussed above may affect working capital, which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations. As of December 31, 2009, we had a deficit in our working capital of $610 million, compared to a deficit of $367 million as of December 31, 2008 primarily due to the repayment of $650 million of borrowings under our credit facility and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations during 2009. We continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations. Ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure, which include our servers, networking equipment and software, release improvements to our software code and search engine marketing and optimization efforts. Our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions, share repurchases or expenditures in support of our business strategy. In the event we have acquisitions or share repurchases, this may reduce our cash balance and or increase our debt. 54 Table of Contents Our cash flows are as follows: Year ended December 31, $ Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 (In millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 676 $ 521 $ 712 $ 155 $ (191 ) Investing activities (48 ) (860 ) (180 ) 812 (680 ) Financing activities (660 ) 465 (790 ) (1,125 ) 1,255 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 9 (78 ) 22 87 (100 ) In 2009, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $155 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes and growth in operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in income tax and interest payments as well as occupancy tax assessments. In 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $191 million primarily due to a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in tax payments and faster invoice and payment processing for our hotel suppliers. In connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments, certain jurisdictions may assert that taxpayers are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances, which is referred to as pay to play. These jurisdictions may also attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of similar tax ordinances. Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we will continue to defend our position vigorously. During 2009, we paid $48 million related to tax assessments in San Francisco. In 2009, cash used in investing activities represented a positive change of $812 million in cash flows primarily due to a $493 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, cash provided by the net maturities of short term investments of $47 million in 2009 compared to $93 million in purchases in 2008 and a decrease in capital expenditures of $68 million. In 2008, cash used in investing activities increased by $680 million primarily due to a $479 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions, including $93 million as a contingent payment for the financial performance of a company we acquired during 2007, as well as the purchase of short term investments of $93 million by eLong and an increase in capital expenditures of $73 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily included the repayment of $650 million of borrowings under the credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily included $457 million of net borrowings of debt. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares in two tender offers where we acquired 55 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $1.385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offers. In addition, we paid withholding taxes for stock option exercises of $121 million on behalf of our Chairman and Senior Executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled. These were offset in part by $585 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility, $55 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $96 million in excess tax benefits on equity awards, of which approximately $92 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our Chairman and Senior Executive. In June 2008, we privately placed $400 million of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due in July 2016 (the 8.5% Notes). The 8.5% Notes were issued at 98.572% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized over their life. Interest is payable semi annually in January and July of each year, beginning January 1, 2009. We used the proceeds, net of the discount and issuance costs, of $392 million to repay the then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $330 million with the remaining cash was used for general corporate purposes. The effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2009 showed a net increase of $87 million primarily due to the relative appreciation in foreign currencies during 2009 compared to their depreciation in 2008. 55 Table of Contents The effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2008 showed a net decrease of $100 million primarily due to a sharp depreciation in foreign currencies during the second half of 2008 compared with appreciating foreign currencies throughout 2007, and included a $21 million loss related to euro cash holdings during the third quarter of 2008 to economically hedge the purchase price of an acquisition. We currently have authorization, for which there is no fixed termination date, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock; no such repurchases have been made under this authorization. The number of shares we may make under this authorization is subject to certain of our debt covenants. We also have a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which Expedia, Inc. may offer from time to time debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants. The shelf registration statement expires on October 15, 2010. In our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs. Our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the credit market disruptions, which were more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009. There can be no assurance, however, that future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009: By Period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years (In millions) Long term debt(1) $ 1,474 $ 71 $ 143 $ 143 $ 1,117 Operating leases(2) 231 38 69 55 69 Purchase obligations(3) 58 32 26 Guarantees(4) 65 65 Letters of credit(4) 42 42 Total(5) $ 1,870 $ 248 $ 238 $ 198 $ 1,186 (1) Our 8.5% Notes and 7.456% Notes include interest payments through maturity in 2016 and 2018, respectively, based on the stated fixed rates. In the above table, we have reflected the 7.456% Notes based on the maturity date in 2018; however such Notes are repayable in whole or in part on August 15, 2013 at the option of the holders. (2) The operating leases are for office space and related office equipment. We account for these leases on a monthly basis. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal options. Operating lease obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2018. (3) Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. (4) Guarantees and LOCs are commitments that represent funding responsibilities that may require our performance in the event of third party demands or contingent events. We use our stand by LOCs primarily to secure payment for hotel room transactions to particular hotel properties. The outstanding balance of our stand by LOCs directly reduces the amount available to us from our revolving credit facility. The LOC amounts in the above table represent the amount of commitment expiration per period. In addition, we provide a guarantee to the aviation authority of one country to protect against potential non delivery of our packaged travel services sold within that country. This country holds all travel agents and tour companies to the same standard. 56 Table of Contents (5) Excludes $190 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. Other than the items described above, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2009. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions For a discussion of certain relationships and related party transactions, see Note 15 Related Party Transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Management Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our exposure to market risk includes our long term debt, our revolving credit facility, derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk In June 2008, we issued $400 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 8.5%. In August 2006, we issued $500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7.456%. As a result, if market interest rates decline, our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. The fair values of our 8.5% Notes and our 7.456% Notes were approximately $431 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2009 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 8.5% Notes by approximately $11 million and our 7.456% Notes by approximately $18 million. In July 2005, we entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility. Interest on the facility was determined by market interest rates plus a spread based on our financial leverage. In February 2010, we entered into a new $750 million revolving credit facility, which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. Because our interest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our outstanding borrowing under the prior revolving credit facility were $0 and $650 million. We currently have no borrowings outstanding under the new facility. We did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in Australia, Canada, China and the European Union. Because we operate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. To the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally, during 2008, we began using foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue 57 Table of Contents exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash and accounts receivable for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency denominated operating liabilities. These instruments are typically short term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a net forward asset of less than $1 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of $1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges. Future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing, through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts, such exposures. As an example, if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10% against the U.S. dollar, we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $1 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures) and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of December 31, 2009. As the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of $30 million ($20 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), $47 million, and $22 million. As we increase our operations in international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. The economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies. Part II.
