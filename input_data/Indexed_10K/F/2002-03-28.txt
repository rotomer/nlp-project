Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations FOURTH QUARTER 2001 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide losses, including charges of $4,106 million primarily related to our Revitalization Plan, were $5,068 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, or $2.81 per diluted share of Common and Class B Stock. In the fourth quarter of 2000, earnings were $1,077 million (including charges for unusual items of $133 million), or $0.57 per diluted share. Worldwide sales and revenues were $41.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001, down $1.4 billion, reflecting primarily lower vehicle sales in North America, partially offset by higher vehicle sales in Europe. Unit sales of cars and trucks were 1,808,000 units, down 32,000 units, reflecting primarily lower market share in the United States, partially offset by higher market share in Europe. Results of our operations by business sector for the fourth quarter of 2001 and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Net Income/(Loss) 2001 Over/(Under) 2001 2000 2000 Automotive sector $(4,708) $ 629 $(5,337) Financial Services sector (360) 448 (808) Total Company net income/(loss) $(5,068) $1,077 $(6,145) Following an extensive review of Fords North and South American operations, on January 11, 2002, we announced the operating and financial goals of our Revitalization Plan, which we expect to achieve by mid decade. The pre tax impact of the Revitalization Plan and other fourth quarter charges include (in billions): Fixed asset impairments North America $3.1 South America 0.7 Total fixed asset impairments 3.8 Precious metals 1.0 Personnel (primarily North America salaried) 0.6 All other 0.3 Total pre tax charges $5.7 Memo: After tax effect of charges $4.1 These substantially non cash charges included $3.9 billion and $204 million for the Automotive sector and the Financial Services sector, respectively. The Automotive related charge included asset impairment charges, write down of precious metals and forward contracts related thereto, employee separation costs (primarily for employees who voluntarily accepted separation offers in 2001) and other charges, such as an accounting charge for Mazda pension expense and the impact of the devaluation of the Argentine peso. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these charges. We expect that the effects of our Revitalization Plan will improve our pre tax operating results to $7 billion annually, an improvement of $9 billion, by mid decade. This expectation is based on assumptions for the U.S. market for 2003 and beyond with respect to industry sales (16 million units annually), Ford brand market share (19%) and net pricing (negative). 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Automotive Sector Worldwide losses for our Automotive sector were $4,708 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 on sales of $33.8 billion. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2000 were $629 million on sales of $35.1 billion. Details of our Automotive sector earnings for the fourth quarter of 2001 and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Net Income/(Loss) 2001 Over/(Under) 2001 2000 2000 North American Automotive $(4,068) $ 607 $(4,675) Automotive Outside North America Europe 61 33 28 South America (598) (31) (567) Rest of World (103) 20 (123) Total Automotive Outside North America (640) 22 (662) Total Automotive sector $(4,708) $ 629 $(5,337) The decrease in our fourth quarter Automotive sector earnings in North America reflected primarily the asset impairments and other charges outlined above, lower vehicle unit sales volumes, significantly increased marketing costs for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands (16.7% of sales compared with 10.7% a year ago), and an increase in warranty and other costs associated with customer satisfaction initiatives. The improved fourth quarter results in Europe reflected an increase in vehicle unit sales and the benefits of last years restructuring actions. The decline in South America reflected primarily asset impairments related to the Revitalization Plan and other charges, lower operating results due to a weaker currency in Brazil, the devaluation of the Argentine peso and lower industry volumes in Brazil and Argentina. Financial Services Sector Details of our Financial Services sector earnings are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Net Income/(Loss) 2001 Over/(Under) 2001 2000 2000 Ford Credit $(297) $410 $(707) Hertz (58) 56 (114) Minority interests and other (5) (18) 13 Total Financial Services sector $(360) $448 $(808) Ford Credits consolidated loss in the fourth quarter of 2001 was $297 million, compared with earnings of $410 million in 2000. This result included charges associated with the Revitalization Plan ($204 million) and the ongoing impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 ($99 million). The Revitalization Plan charges included costs for strategic partnering actions in Brazil, including writedowns and losses related to the disposition of certain assets ($126 million); government initiatives in Argentina related to currency devaluation and consumer debt ($65 million); and voluntary employee separation costs in North America ($13 million). Excluding these charges and the impact of SFAS No. 133, Ford Credit earned $6 million, down $404 million from the same period a year earlier. The reduction was more than accounted for by a higher provision for credit losses ($913 million after taxes in 2001 compared with $360 million in 2000), offset partially by favorable volumes, margins and investment and other income related to securitizations. The higher provision for credit losses was in response to 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) higher credit loss experience in the fourth quarter of 2001, reflecting significant weakening economic conditions in the United States. Losses at Hertz in the fourth quarter of 2001 were $58 million, compared with earnings of $56 million a year ago. The profit decline was primarily due to the lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the slowdown in the U.S. economy. FULL YEAR 2001 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide sales and revenues were $162.4 billion in 2001, down $7.7 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily lower vehicle sales in North America, offset partially by higher vehicle sales in Europe. We sold 6,991,000 cars and trucks in 2001, down 433,000 units, reflecting primarily lower market share in the United States, partially offset by higher market share in Europe. Results of our operations by business sector for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $ 4,986 Financial Services sector 814 1,786 1,516 Income/(Loss) from continuing operations (5,453) 5,410 6,502 Income from discontinued operation* 309 735 Loss on spin off of discontinued operation (2,252) Total Company net income/(loss) $(5,453) $ 3,467 $ 7,237 * Visteon Corporation, our former automotive components subsidiary, was spun off to Ford Common and Class B stockholders on June 28, 2000. 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following unusual items were included in our 2001, 2000, and 1999 income from continuing operations (in millions): Automotive Sector Rest Total Financial North South of Auto Services America Europe America World Sector Sector 2001 Derivative instruments (SFAS No. 133) transition adjustment and ongoing effects $ (95) $ (95) $ (157) Mazda restructuring actions in the second quarter $ (114) (114) Write down of E commerce and Automotive related ventures in the third quarter (199) (199) Revitalization Plan and other fourth quarter charges (includes portion of SFAS No. 133) (3,149) $(552) (201) (3,902) (204) Total 2001 unusual items $(3,443) $(552) $ (315) $(4,310) $ (361) 2000 Asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations in Europe in the second quarter $(1,019) $(1,019) Inventory related profit reduction for Land Rover in the third quarter $ (13) (76) $ (17) (106) Write down of assets associated with the Nemak joint venture in the fourth quarter (133) (133) Total 2000 unusual items $ (146) $(1,095) $ (17) $(1,258) $ 1999 Gain from the sale of our interest in AutoEuropa to Volkswagen AG in the first quarter $ 165 $ 165 Inventory related profit reduction for Volvo Car in the second quarter $ (16) (125) $ (5) (146) Visteon related postretirement adjustment in the third quarter (incl. in Total Auto Sector) (125) Employee separation costs in the third quarter (79) (79) $ (23) Lump sum payments relating to ratification of the 1999 United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers contracts in the fourth quarter (80) (80) Total 1999 unusual items $ (175) $ 40 $ (5) $ (265) $ (23) Excluding these unusual items, losses from continuing operations would have been $782 million in 2001, compared with income from continuing operations of $6,668 million in 2000 and $6,790 million in 1999. 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We established and communicated the financial milestones listed below for 2001, which excluded Visteon in both the 2000 base period and 2001. Our results against these milestones, excluding the unusual items described above, are listed below. 2001 Milestone Actual Result Total Company Revenue Grow $5 billion Declined $8 billion Automotive North America 4%+ return on sales (2.3)% Europe 1%+ return on sales 0.8% South America Improve results Improved by $12 million Rest of World Achieve profitability Earned $156 million Total Costs Reduce $1 billion Increased $1 billion* (at constant volume and mix) Capital Spending Contain at $8 billion or less Spent $6.4 billion Financial Services Ford Credit Improve returns Declined 3.6 percentage points Grow earnings 10% Declined 22% * Excludes costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 North American Automotive $(5,597) $ 4,886 $5,418 Automotive Outside North America Europe 266 (1,130) 50 South America (777) (240) (444) Rest of World (159) 108 87 Total Automotive Outside North America (670) (1,262) (307) Visteon related postretirement adjustment (125) Total Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $4,986 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,267 million in 2001 on sales of $131.5 billion, compared with earnings of $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141.2 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,597 million in 2001 on sales of $91.0 billion, compared with earnings of $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased warranty and other costs associated with customer satisfaction initiatives. 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,130 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $777 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up about 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazils economy has recently entered into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and monetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth. We expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions continue to remain weak in Argentina primarily as a result of the recent peso devaluation. Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4 percentage points). Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $108 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. 2000 Compared with 1999 Worldwide earnings from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141 billion, compared with $4,986 million in 1999 on sales of $135 billion. The decrease in earnings reflected asset impairments and restructuring charges in Europe and lower earnings in North America, offset partially by improved results in South America. Adjusted for constant volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive sector declined $500 million compared with 1999. Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in North America were $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion, compared with $5,418 million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily costs associated with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The after tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in 2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999. 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2000, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999. Our Automotive sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with earnings of $50 million a year ago. The decline reflected primarily the second quarter 2000 charge of $1,019 million related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations. In 2000, approximately 17.9 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of Volvo Car and Land Rover, offset by a decrease in market share for Ford brand vehicles. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflected primarily continued aggressive competition. Our Automotive sector in South America lost $240 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with a loss of $444 million in 1999. The improvement reflected primarily higher vehicle margins resulting from cost reductions and improved product mix and pricing. In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.3 million in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in 2000, down 0.6 percentage points from 1999. The decline in market share reflected increased competition. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in the Rest of World were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from 1999. In 2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%, down 1.9 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings of our Financial Services sector consist primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Ford Credit $839 $1,536 $1,261 Hertz 23 358 336 Minority interests and other (48) (108) (81) Total Financial Services sector $814 $1,786 $1,516 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million, down $697 million or 45% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133, net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Automotive Sector Worldwide losses for our Automotive sector were $4,708 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 on sales of $33.8 billion. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2000 were $629 million on sales of $35.1 billion. Details of our Automotive sector earnings for the fourth quarter of 2001 and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Net Income/(Loss) 2001 Over/(Under) 2001 2000 2000 North American Automotive $(4,068) $ 607 $(4,675) Automotive Outside North America Europe 61 33 28 South America (598) (31) (567) Rest of World (103) 20 (123) Total Automotive Outside North America (640) 22 (662) Total Automotive sector $(4,708) $ 629 $(5,337) The decrease in our fourth quarter Automotive sector earnings in North America reflected primarily the asset impairments and other charges outlined above, lower vehicle unit sales volumes, significantly increased marketing costs for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands (16.7% of sales compared with 10.7% a year ago), and an increase in warranty and other costs associated with customer satisfaction initiatives. The improved fourth quarter results in Europe reflected an increase in vehicle unit sales and the benefits of last years restructuring actions. The decline in South America reflected primarily asset impairments related to the Revitalization Plan and other charges, lower operating results due to a weaker currency in Brazil, the devaluation of the Argentine peso and lower industry volumes in Brazil and Argentina. Financial Services Sector Details of our Financial Services sector earnings are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Net Income/(Loss) 2001 Over/(Under) 2001 2000 2000 Ford Credit $(297) $410 $(707) Hertz (58) 56 (114) Minority interests and other (5) (18) 13 Total Financial Services sector $(360) $448 $(808) Ford Credits consolidated loss in the fourth quarter of 2001 was $297 million, compared with earnings of $410 million in 2000. This result included charges associated with the Revitalization Plan ($204 million) and the ongoing impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 ($99 million). The Revitalization Plan charges included costs for strategic partnering actions in Brazil, including writedowns and losses related to the disposition of certain assets ($126 million); government initiatives in Argentina related to currency devaluation and consumer debt ($65 million); and voluntary employee separation costs in North America ($13 million). Excluding these charges and the impact of SFAS No. 133, Ford Credit earned $6 million, down $404 million from the same period a year earlier. The reduction was more than accounted for by a higher provision for credit losses ($913 million after taxes in 2001 compared with $360 million in 2000), offset partially by favorable volumes, margins and investment and other income related to securitizations. The higher provision for credit losses was in response to 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) higher credit loss experience in the fourth quarter of 2001, reflecting significant weakening economic conditions in the United States. Losses at Hertz in the fourth quarter of 2001 were $58 million, compared with earnings of $56 million a year ago. The profit decline was primarily due to the lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the slowdown in the U.S. economy. FULL YEAR 2001 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide sales and revenues were $162.4 billion in 2001, down $7.7 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily lower vehicle sales in North America, offset partially by higher vehicle sales in Europe. We sold 6,991,000 cars and trucks in 2001, down 433,000 units, reflecting primarily lower market share in the United States, partially offset by higher market share in Europe. Results of our operations by business sector for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $ 4,986 Financial Services sector 814 1,786 1,516 Income/(Loss) from continuing operations (5,453) 5,410 6,502 Income from discontinued operation* 309 735 Loss on spin off of discontinued operation (2,252) Total Company net income/(loss) $(5,453) $ 3,467 $ 7,237 * Visteon Corporation, our former automotive components subsidiary, was spun off to Ford Common and Class B stockholders on June 28, 2000. 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following unusual items were included in our 2001, 2000, and 1999 income from continuing operations (in millions): Automotive Sector Rest Total Financial North South of Auto Services America Europe America World Sector Sector 2001 Derivative instruments (SFAS No. 133) transition adjustment and ongoing effects $ (95) $ (95) $ (157) Mazda restructuring actions in the second quarter $ (114) (114) Write down of E commerce and Automotive related ventures in the third quarter (199) (199) Revitalization Plan and other fourth quarter charges (includes portion of SFAS No. 133) (3,149) $(552) (201) (3,902) (204) Total 2001 unusual items $(3,443) $(552) $ (315) $(4,310) $ (361) 2000 Asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations in Europe in the second quarter $(1,019) $(1,019) Inventory related profit reduction for Land Rover in the third quarter $ (13) (76) $ (17) (106) Write down of assets associated with the Nemak joint venture in the fourth quarter (133) (133) Total 2000 unusual items $ (146) $(1,095) $ (17) $(1,258) $ 1999 Gain from the sale of our interest in AutoEuropa to Volkswagen AG in the first quarter $ 165 $ 165 Inventory related profit reduction for Volvo Car in the second quarter $ (16) (125) $ (5) (146) Visteon related postretirement adjustment in the third quarter (incl. in Total Auto Sector) (125) Employee separation costs in the third quarter (79) (79) $ (23) Lump sum payments relating to ratification of the 1999 United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers contracts in the fourth quarter (80) (80) Total 1999 unusual items $ (175) $ 40 $ (5) $ (265) $ (23) Excluding these unusual items, losses from continuing operations would have been $782 million in 2001, compared with income from continuing operations of $6,668 million in 2000 and $6,790 million in 1999. 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We established and communicated the financial milestones listed below for 2001, which excluded Visteon in both the 2000 base period and 2001. Our results against these milestones, excluding the unusual items described above, are listed below. 2001 Milestone Actual Result Total Company Revenue Grow $5 billion Declined $8 billion Automotive North America 4%+ return on sales (2.3)% Europe 1%+ return on sales 0.8% South America Improve results Improved by $12 million Rest of World Achieve profitability Earned $156 million Total Costs Reduce $1 billion Increased $1 billion* (at constant volume and mix) Capital Spending Contain at $8 billion or less Spent $6.4 billion Financial Services Ford Credit Improve returns Declined 3.6 percentage points Grow earnings 10% Declined 22% * Excludes costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 North American Automotive $(5,597) $ 4,886 $5,418 Automotive Outside North America Europe 266 (1,130) 50 South America (777) (240) (444) Rest of World (159) 108 87 Total Automotive Outside North America (670) (1,262) (307) Visteon related postretirement adjustment (125) Total Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $4,986 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,267 million in 2001 on sales of $131.5 billion, compared with earnings of $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141.2 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,597 million in 2001 on sales of $91.0 billion, compared with earnings of $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased warranty and other costs associated with customer satisfaction initiatives. 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,130 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $777 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up about 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazils economy has recently entered into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and monetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth. We expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions continue to remain weak in Argentina primarily as a result of the recent peso devaluation. Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4 percentage points). Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $108 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. 2000 Compared with 1999 Worldwide earnings from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141 billion, compared with $4,986 million in 1999 on sales of $135 billion. The decrease in earnings reflected asset impairments and restructuring charges in Europe and lower earnings in North America, offset partially by improved results in South America. Adjusted for constant volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive sector declined $500 million compared with 1999. Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in North America were $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion, compared with $5,418 million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily costs associated with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The after tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in 2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999. 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2000, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999. Our Automotive sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with earnings of $50 million a year ago. The decline reflected primarily the second quarter 2000 charge of $1,019 million related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations. In 2000, approximately 17.9 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of Volvo Car and Land Rover, offset by a decrease in market share for Ford brand vehicles. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflected primarily continued aggressive competition. Our Automotive sector in South America lost $240 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with a loss of $444 million in 1999. The improvement reflected primarily higher vehicle margins resulting from cost reductions and improved product mix and pricing. In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.3 million in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in 2000, down 0.6 percentage points from 1999. The decline in market share reflected increased competition. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in the Rest of World were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from 1999. In 2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%, down 1.9 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings of our Financial Services sector consist primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Ford Credit $839 $1,536 $1,261 Hertz 23 358 336 Minority interests and other (48) (108) (81) Total Financial Services sector $814 $1,786 $1,516 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million, down $697 million or 45% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133, net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) higher credit loss experience in the fourth quarter of 2001, reflecting significant weakening economic conditions in the United States. Losses at Hertz in the fourth quarter of 2001 were $58 million, compared with earnings of $56 million a year ago. The profit decline was primarily due to the lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the slowdown in the U.S. economy. FULL YEAR 2001 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide sales and revenues were $162.4 billion in 2001, down $7.7 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily lower vehicle sales in North America, offset partially by higher vehicle sales in Europe. We sold 6,991,000 cars and trucks in 2001, down 433,000 units, reflecting primarily lower market share in the United States, partially offset by higher market share in Europe. Results of our operations by business sector for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $ 4,986 Financial Services sector 814 1,786 1,516 Income/(Loss) from continuing operations (5,453) 5,410 6,502 Income from discontinued operation* 309 735 Loss on spin off of discontinued operation (2,252) Total Company net income/(loss) $(5,453) $ 3,467 $ 7,237 * Visteon Corporation, our former automotive components subsidiary, was spun off to Ford Common and Class B stockholders on June 28, 2000. 41 Item 7.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We established and communicated the financial milestones listed below for 2001, which excluded Visteon in both the 2000 base period and 2001. Our results against these milestones, excluding the unusual items described above, are listed below. 2001 Milestone Actual Result Total Company Revenue Grow $5 billion Declined $8 billion Automotive North America 4%+ return on sales (2.3)% Europe 1%+ return on sales 0.8% South America Improve results Improved by $12 million Rest of World Achieve profitability Earned $156 million Total Costs Reduce $1 billion Increased $1 billion* (at constant volume and mix) Capital Spending Contain at $8 billion or less Spent $6.4 billion Financial Services Ford Credit Improve returns Declined 3.6 percentage points Grow earnings 10% Declined 22% * Excludes costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 North American Automotive $(5,597) $ 4,886 $5,418 Automotive Outside North America Europe 266 (1,130) 50 South America (777) (240) (444) Rest of World (159) 108 87 Total Automotive Outside North America (670) (1,262) (307) Visteon related postretirement adjustment (125) Total Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $4,986 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,267 million in 2001 on sales of $131.5 billion, compared with earnings of $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141.2 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,597 million in 2001 on sales of $91.0 billion, compared with earnings of $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased warranty and other costs associated with customer satisfaction initiatives. 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,130 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $777 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up about 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazils economy has recently entered into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and monetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth. We expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions continue to remain weak in Argentina primarily as a result of the recent peso devaluation. Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4 percentage points). Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $108 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. 2000 Compared with 1999 Worldwide earnings from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141 billion, compared with $4,986 million in 1999 on sales of $135 billion. The decrease in earnings reflected asset impairments and restructuring charges in Europe and lower earnings in North America, offset partially by improved results in South America. Adjusted for constant volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive sector declined $500 million compared with 1999. Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in North America were $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion, compared with $5,418 million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily costs associated with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The after tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in 2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999. 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2000, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999. Our Automotive sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with earnings of $50 million a year ago. The decline reflected primarily the second quarter 2000 charge of $1,019 million related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations. In 2000, approximately 17.9 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of Volvo Car and Land Rover, offset by a decrease in market share for Ford brand vehicles. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflected primarily continued aggressive competition. Our Automotive sector in South America lost $240 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with a loss of $444 million in 1999. The improvement reflected primarily higher vehicle margins resulting from cost reductions and improved product mix and pricing. In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.3 million in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in 2000, down 0.6 percentage points from 1999. The decline in market share reflected increased competition. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in the Rest of World were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from 1999. In 2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%, down 1.9 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings of our Financial Services sector consist primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Ford Credit $839 $1,536 $1,261 Hertz 23 358 336 Minority interests and other (48) (108) (81) Total Financial Services sector $814 $1,786 $1,516 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million, down $697 million or 45% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133, net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following unusual items were included in our 2001, 2000, and 1999 income from continuing operations (in millions): Automotive Sector Rest Total Financial North South of Auto Services America Europe America World Sector Sector 2001 Derivative instruments (SFAS No. 133) transition adjustment and ongoing effects $ (95) $ (95) $ (157) Mazda restructuring actions in the second quarter $ (114) (114) Write down of E commerce and Automotive related ventures in the third quarter (199) (199) Revitalization Plan and other fourth quarter charges (includes portion of SFAS No. 133) (3,149) $(552) (201) (3,902) (204) Total 2001 unusual items $(3,443) $(552) $ (315) $(4,310) $ (361) 2000 Asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations in Europe in the second quarter $(1,019) $(1,019) Inventory related profit reduction for Land Rover in the third quarter $ (13) (76) $ (17) (106) Write down of assets associated with the Nemak joint venture in the fourth quarter (133) (133) Total 2000 unusual items $ (146) $(1,095) $ (17) $(1,258) $ 1999 Gain from the sale of our interest in AutoEuropa to Volkswagen AG in the first quarter $ 165 $ 165 Inventory related profit reduction for Volvo Car in the second quarter $ (16) (125) $ (5) (146) Visteon related postretirement adjustment in the third quarter (incl. in Total Auto Sector) (125) Employee separation costs in the third quarter (79) (79) $ (23) Lump sum payments relating to ratification of the 1999 United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers contracts in the fourth quarter (80) (80) Total 1999 unusual items $ (175) $ 40 $ (5) $ (265) $ (23) Excluding these unusual items, losses from continuing operations would have been $782 million in 2001, compared with income from continuing operations of $6,668 million in 2000 and $6,790 million in 1999. 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We established and communicated the financial milestones listed below for 2001, which excluded Visteon in both the 2000 base period and 2001. Our results against these milestones, excluding the unusual items described above, are listed below. 2001 Milestone Actual Result Total Company Revenue Grow $5 billion Declined $8 billion Automotive North America 4%+ return on sales (2.3)% Europe 1%+ return on sales 0.8% South America Improve results Improved by $12 million Rest of World Achieve profitability Earned $156 million Total Costs Reduce $1 billion Increased $1 billion* (at constant volume and mix) Capital Spending Contain at $8 billion or less Spent $6.4 billion Financial Services Ford Credit Improve returns Declined 3.6 percentage points Grow earnings 10% Declined 22% * Excludes costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 North American Automotive $(5,597) $ 4,886 $5,418 Automotive Outside North America Europe 266 (1,130) 50 South America (777) (240) (444) Rest of World (159) 108 87 Total Automotive Outside North America (670) (1,262) (307) Visteon related postretirement adjustment (125) Total Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $4,986 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,267 million in 2001 on sales of $131.5 billion, compared with earnings of $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141.2 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,597 million in 2001 on sales of $91.0 billion, compared with earnings of $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased warranty and other costs associated with customer satisfaction initiatives. 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,130 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $777 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up about 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazils economy has recently entered into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and monetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth. We expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions continue to remain weak in Argentina primarily as a result of the recent peso devaluation. Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4 percentage points). Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $108 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. 2000 Compared with 1999 Worldwide earnings from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141 billion, compared with $4,986 million in 1999 on sales of $135 billion. The decrease in earnings reflected asset impairments and restructuring charges in Europe and lower earnings in North America, offset partially by improved results in South America. Adjusted for constant volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive sector declined $500 million compared with 1999. Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in North America were $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion, compared with $5,418 million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily costs associated with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The after tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in 2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999. 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2000, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999. Our Automotive sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with earnings of $50 million a year ago. The decline reflected primarily the second quarter 2000 charge of $1,019 million related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations. In 2000, approximately 17.9 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of Volvo Car and Land Rover, offset by a decrease in market share for Ford brand vehicles. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflected primarily continued aggressive competition. Our Automotive sector in South America lost $240 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with a loss of $444 million in 1999. The improvement reflected primarily higher vehicle margins resulting from cost reductions and improved product mix and pricing. In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.3 million in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in 2000, down 0.6 percentage points from 1999. The decline in market share reflected increased competition. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in the Rest of World were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from 1999. In 2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%, down 1.9 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings of our Financial Services sector consist primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Ford Credit $839 $1,536 $1,261 Hertz 23 358 336 Minority interests and other (48) (108) (81) Total Financial Services sector $814 $1,786 $1,516 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million, down $697 million or 45% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133, net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We established and communicated the financial milestones listed below for 2001, which excluded Visteon in both the 2000 base period and 2001. Our results against these milestones, excluding the unusual items described above, are listed below. 2001 Milestone Actual Result Total Company Revenue Grow $5 billion Declined $8 billion Automotive North America 4%+ return on sales (2.3)% Europe 1%+ return on sales 0.8% South America Improve results Improved by $12 million Rest of World Achieve profitability Earned $156 million Total Costs Reduce $1 billion Increased $1 billion* (at constant volume and mix) Capital Spending Contain at $8 billion or less Spent $6.4 billion Financial Services Ford Credit Improve returns Declined 3.6 percentage points Grow earnings 10% Declined 22% * Excludes costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 North American Automotive $(5,597) $ 4,886 $5,418 Automotive Outside North America Europe 266 (1,130) 50 South America (777) (240) (444) Rest of World (159) 108 87 Total Automotive Outside North America (670) (1,262) (307) Visteon related postretirement adjustment (125) Total Automotive sector $(6,267) $ 3,624 $4,986 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,267 million in 2001 on sales of $131.5 billion, compared with earnings of $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141.2 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,597 million in 2001 on sales of $91.0 billion, compared with earnings of $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased warranty and other costs associated with customer satisfaction initiatives. 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,130 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $777 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up about 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazils economy has recently entered into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and monetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth. We expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions continue to remain weak in Argentina primarily as a result of the recent peso devaluation. Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4 percentage points). Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $108 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. 2000 Compared with 1999 Worldwide earnings from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141 billion, compared with $4,986 million in 1999 on sales of $135 billion. The decrease in earnings reflected asset impairments and restructuring charges in Europe and lower earnings in North America, offset partially by improved results in South America. Adjusted for constant volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive sector declined $500 million compared with 1999. Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in North America were $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion, compared with $5,418 million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily costs associated with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The after tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in 2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999. 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2000, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999. Our Automotive sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with earnings of $50 million a year ago. The decline reflected primarily the second quarter 2000 charge of $1,019 million related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations. In 2000, approximately 17.9 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of Volvo Car and Land Rover, offset by a decrease in market share for Ford brand vehicles. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflected primarily continued aggressive competition. Our Automotive sector in South America lost $240 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with a loss of $444 million in 1999. The improvement reflected primarily higher vehicle margins resulting from cost reductions and improved product mix and pricing. In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.3 million in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in 2000, down 0.6 percentage points from 1999. The decline in market share reflected increased competition. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in the Rest of World were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from 1999. In 2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%, down 1.9 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings of our Financial Services sector consist primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Ford Credit $839 $1,536 $1,261 Hertz 23 358 336 Minority interests and other (48) (108) (81) Total Financial Services sector $814 $1,786 $1,516 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million, down $697 million or 45% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133, net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,130 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $777 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up about 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazils economy has recently entered into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and monetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth. We expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions continue to remain weak in Argentina primarily as a result of the recent peso devaluation. Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4 percentage points). Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $108 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. 2000 Compared with 1999 Worldwide earnings from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141 billion, compared with $4,986 million in 1999 on sales of $135 billion. The decrease in earnings reflected asset impairments and restructuring charges in Europe and lower earnings in North America, offset partially by improved results in South America. Adjusted for constant volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive sector declined $500 million compared with 1999. Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in North America were $4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9 billion, compared with $5,418 million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily costs associated with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The after tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in 2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999. 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2000, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999. Our Automotive sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with earnings of $50 million a year ago. The decline reflected primarily the second quarter 2000 charge of $1,019 million related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations. In 2000, approximately 17.9 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of Volvo Car and Land Rover, offset by a decrease in market share for Ford brand vehicles. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflected primarily continued aggressive competition. Our Automotive sector in South America lost $240 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with a loss of $444 million in 1999. The improvement reflected primarily higher vehicle margins resulting from cost reductions and improved product mix and pricing. In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.3 million in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in 2000, down 0.6 percentage points from 1999. The decline in market share reflected increased competition. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in the Rest of World were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from 1999. In 2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%, down 1.9 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings of our Financial Services sector consist primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Ford Credit $839 $1,536 $1,261 Hertz 23 358 336 Minority interests and other (48) (108) (81) Total Financial Services sector $814 $1,786 $1,516 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million, down $697 million or 45% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133, net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2000, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999. Our Automotive sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with earnings of $50 million a year ago. The decline reflected primarily the second quarter 2000 charge of $1,019 million related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations. In 2000, approximately 17.9 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of Volvo Car and Land Rover, offset by a decrease in market share for Ford brand vehicles. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflected primarily continued aggressive competition. Our Automotive sector in South America lost $240 million from continuing operations in 2000, compared with a loss of $444 million in 1999. The improvement reflected primarily higher vehicle margins resulting from cost reductions and improved product mix and pricing. In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.3 million in 1999. Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in 2000, down 0.6 percentage points from 1999. The decline in market share reflected increased competition. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in the Rest of World were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from 1999. In 2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%, down 1.9 percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings of our Financial Services sector consist primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are shown below (in millions): Net Income/(Loss) 2001 2000 1999 Ford Credit $839 $1,536 $1,261 Hertz 23 358 336 Minority interests and other (48) (108) (81) Total Financial Services sector $814 $1,786 $1,516 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million, down $697 million or 45% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133, net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention).

FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The following table summarizes the effects of securitization transactions on Ford Credits earnings for the years indicated (in millions on a pre tax basis): 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of receivables $ 739 $ 14 $ 83 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (327) Net gain 412 14 83 Servicing fees collected 456 190 136 Interest income from retained securities 379 152 173 Excess spread and other 186 201 41 Total investment and other income related to securitization $1,433 $ 557 $ 433 Memo: Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 433 Securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables, as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from sold receiveables that Ford Credit continues to service, and other income related to interest only strips. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. As shown above, in 2001 such gains were $412 million, compared with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credits financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of securitization for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Total investment and other income related to securitization (excluding SFAS No. 133) $1,760 $ 557 $ 3 Impact of current year receivable sales on financing margin (1,059) (243) (218) Impact of prior year receivable sales on financing margin (611) (521) (158) Pre tax impact of securitization 90 (207) 57 Tax (33) 77 (21) After tax impact of securitization $ 57 $ (130) $ 36 Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates, and Ford Credit is planning to sell a smaller amount of finance receivables, we do not anticipate that the gains on sales of receivables will continue at the level experienced in 2001. As a result of the large increase in the use of securitization in 2001, we also anticipate that there will be a significant unfavorable effect on Ford Credits financing margin in 2002. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy. 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2000 Compared with 1999 Ford Credits consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million, up $275 million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected primarily improved net financing margins and a higher level of receivables, offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs. Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of $336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume related performance, offset partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include cash generated from operations, gross cash balances, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which reflect financial assets available to fund the business and pay future obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.1 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Marketable securities 10.9 13.1 18.9 VEBA 2.7 3.7 3.7 Gross cash $ 17.7 $ 20.2 $ 25.4 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating related (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures and financing related. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Present year end gross cash $17.7 $20.2 $25.4 Prior year end gross cash 20.2 25.4 25.7 Present over (under) prior $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(6.3) $ 3.6 $ 5.0 Capital expenditures (6.4) (7.4) (7.1) Depreciation and amortization 5.3 5.4 5.2 Impairment charges (depreciation and amortization) 3.8 1.1 Changes in working capital a/ 4.6 4.1 (1.9) Capital transactions with Financial Services sector b/ 0.4 0.7 0.4 All other (0.1) (0.7) 4.5 Total operating related 1.3 6.8 6.1 Acquisitions and divestitures (2.3) (2.7) (5.8) Financing related Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (1.9) (2.8) (2.3) Issuance of common stock 0.5 0.6 0.3 Purchase of common stock (1.8) (1.8) (0.7) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt 1.7 0.3 2.1 Total financing related (1.5) (9.3) (0.6) Total change in gross cash $(2.5) $(5.2) $(0.3) a/ Working capital includes current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt). b/ Includes capital contributions, dividends, loans, loan repayments and asset sales. In 2001, we spent $6.4 billion for capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down $1.0 billion from 2000, reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions. Capital expenditures were 4.8% of sales in 2001, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago. The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily lower receivables ($2.2 billion in 2001 compared with $4.7 billion in 2000), resulting largely from implementation of Fords best practices for receivables management (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory improvements across much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000). Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001. However, no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to Ford Credit as additional equity, which lowered Ford Credits debt to equity ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt). In 2001, we spent $2.0 billion for acquisitions of other companies (primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in Hertz. These expenditures were offset partially by divestitures (primarily proceeds of about $400 million from the sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture). 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2001, we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program ($1.2 billion) and our anti dilutive share repurchase program. Issuances of common stock in 2001, reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises, resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500 million. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had total debt of $13.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately 28 years, of which $902 million matures by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% of this amount is available through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non guaranteed basis, $7.4 billion and $598 million of these credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively. Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities On January 30, 2002, we sold 100 million shares of Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to the public at a price of $50 per share, for net proceeds (after underwriting commissions, but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The preferred securities were issued by Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II, the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company. The preferred securities can be converted into shares of Ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted, the aggregate amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about 282 million shares. Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31, 2001, equal to last year. Outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2001 totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit, with an average remaining maturity of 48 days. At December 31, 2001, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables and, in the case of Ford Credit Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from $42.3 billion at the end of 2000 to $15.7 billion ($13.8 billion net of overborrowings) at December 31, 2001 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention).

FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings by Ford Credits foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2001, Ford Credit issued approximately $40.3 billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years. During 2002, Ford Credit plans to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through term debt issuances and $15 billion to $20 billion through securitization transactions (excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs), which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive. Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost (as described below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity. Ford Credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient. Ford Credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs. As a result of this funding strategy, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credits funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available. We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions. However, Ford Credits ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury Notes of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). The relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons Ford Credit securitizes assets as a funding source. Since 1998, the fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over 264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates. Over the last year, Ford Credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ford Credits proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below (in billions): Receivable Type 2001 2000 1999 Retail $32.0 $19.2 $8.7 Wholesale 8.8 0.3 1.2 Net Proceeds... $40.8 $19.5 $9.9 In addition, in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables resulting in $9.6 billion of proceeds. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) For additional liquidity, Ford Credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December 31, 2001, including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in use at December 31, 2001 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe may at Fords option use $7.4 billion and $598 million, respectively, of Fords committed credit facilities, which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December 31, 2001, banks also provided $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper program. Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.4 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these commitments were utilized. Special Purpose Entities Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations. Ford Credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinate classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve, for the benefit of securitization investors, isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the SPE would be beyond the reach of Ford Credits creditors. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of these SPEs are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors, with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after investors are fully paid. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees. The retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit that was held by SPEs was $58.7 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall into three basic categories: Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE. Receivable repurchase obligations. The rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations. Ford Credit makes representations and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria. If a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered, the SPE may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the SPE. The repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest. Mandatory sale of additional receivables. Ford Credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations. In most amortizing structures, the SPE issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received. In revolving structures, the SPE issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period, before receiving repayments of principal. Because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the sponsor of the securitization transaction, is required to replenish or "top up" the SPE with new receivables, which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period. In addition, in connection with securitization transactions, the SPE engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of 1% of the principal amount of the receivables. As servicer of the sold receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures. However, if Ford Credit makes material changes to a receivable, including changes to the interest rate, changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates, Ford Credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the SPE at face value plus accrued interest. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertzs fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets. During 2001, Hertz aligned its funding strategy with Ford Credits by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity, and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.6 billion represents global and other committed credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million consists of seasonal short term facilities; and $500 million consists of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, down $10.8 billion compared with December 31, 2000. This decrease reflected primarily net losses of $5.5 billion, dividend payments of $1.9 billion, foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.2 billion (primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion (primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps) and $1.2 billion spent on share repurchases. Dividends and Share Repurchases In October 2001, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2001 dividend on Fords common and Class B stock of $0.15 per share, which represented a 50% reduction from the $0.30 per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of 2000. On January 11, 2002, our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share, which represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend. These dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5 billion annually. Also, during 2001 we purchased $1.2 billion of our common stock under our $5 billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000. However, in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On September 26, 2001, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A and lowered Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertzs short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies as negative. Moodys Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A2 to A3, affirmed Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings at A2 and Prime 1, respectively, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from stable to negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long and short term debt ratings from A3 to Baa1 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and changed its rating 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) outlook on Hertz to negative. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from A to BBB+, lowered Ford Credits short term debt rating from A 1 to A 2, and changed the rating outlook for both companies from negative to stable. S&P also lowered Hertzs long and short term debt ratings from A to BBB and from A 1 to A 2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies to negative. Contractual Obligations and Commitments For information regarding debt and other obligations of the Automotive and Financial Services sectors, including amounts maturing in each of the next five years, see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we, as part of our normal business practices, enter into long term arrangements with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed/minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. HERTZ PURCHASE In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired (for a total price of about $735 million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about 18% of the economic interest in Hertz. As a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill and existing intangible assets and goodwill be evaluated for these new separation requirements. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. At year end 2001, we had goodwill of $6.6 billion and other intangible assets of $1.3 billion. We are presently evaluating the amount of the transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to Kwik Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We will adopt the Statement on January 1, 2003. Although we are assessing the impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. Although we are 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives.

Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk.

Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) assessing the impact, we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following: Product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty. An example of a customer satisfaction action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May 2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our vehicles. Warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated. Marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through Ford Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing program) are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. In general, the amount of financing cost that we provide to Ford Credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate. Costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them. To the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted. Retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit (i.e., health care and life insurance) costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on AA rated corporate long term bond yields. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) our North and South American Automotive operations in 2001 and our European Automotive operations in 2000. Allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in Ford Credits portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases. These losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal, interest or lease payments. Our estimates are based on several factors, including prices of used vehicles, loan to value ratios, the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation (all of which affect severity of loss) and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio (both of which affect the frequency of defaults). We monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. When we determine an account to be uncollectible, we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses. We increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account. For information regarding how Ford Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Ford Credit Market and Other Risks Credit Risk." Depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio. Our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us. We sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information, such as our new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. We record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases. Initially, depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination. Monthly, we monitor vehicle line performance and, quarterly, we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are: lease termination volumes, vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that modifications are necessary, we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio. OUTLOOK Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in our major markets is as follows: United States approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.5 million units sold in 2001 Europe approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on nineteen markets) Brazil approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6 million units sold in 2001 Australia approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000 units sold in 2001 Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing costs, which are expected to be higher in 2002), we expect 2002 earnings (excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven, 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject.

AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in affiliates. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange, interest rate and other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We use a value at risk ("VAR") analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows: o A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments (e.g., forwards and options) and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an 18 month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) o The VAR analysis calculates the potential risk, within a 99% confidence level, on cross border currency cash flow exposures, including the effects of foreign currency derivatives. (Translation exposures are not included in the VAR analysis). The Monte Carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution. o Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the RiskMetricsTM datasets. Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates. Based on our overall currency exposure (including derivative positions) during 2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average $300 million, with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2001, currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $275 million, within a 99% confidence level. Compared with our projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001 VAR amount is approximately $25 million lower, primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately a negative $259 million and a positive $56 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $267 million and $280 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts and stockpiles. The $1 billion pre tax write down of precious metals, discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, related to these procurement activities. In conjunction with this write down, we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our Treasurers Office, which manages our price hedging activity. Our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines. Speculative actions are not permitted. In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a VAR analysis, using historical volatilities, to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges, forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge. Based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity, at December 31, 2001, commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million, within a 99% confidence level. Over the last year the VAR measurements averaged $339 million, with a high of $625 million and a low of $167 million. These risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Exposures are monitored on a regular basis. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. Exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor, within a 95% confidence level (market convention). Estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make Ford Credits positions less valuable. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. o Operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems, actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by Ford Credits own employees or outside persons. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks. See Ford Motor Credit Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject. Credit Risk Ford Credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers. These contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used. Segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract. Ford Credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies. In general, collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. As a final step, after reasonable collection efforts have failed, vehicles are repossessed; however, collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible. Ford Credit also extends non consumer loans, which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities. To monitor credit performance, Ford Credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements, performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers), and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Residual Risk Ford Credits lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in Automotive Leasing Guide. For financial reporting purposes, however, Ford Credit sets the internal value of expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans, marketing programs and quality metrics. Any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and Ford Credits internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation. Ford Credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values. At lease termination, Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value, net of transportation cost. Sometimes, lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns. Market Risk The goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford Credit uses various financial instruments, particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk. Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not engage in any trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets. Since Ford Credits principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of Ford Credits financial assets and derivative instruments and, therefore, would not be expected to have a material impact on Ford Credits financial position or results of operations. For instance, assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets, debt and hedging instruments, Ford Credits after tax earnings would decline by $66 million over the ensuing twelve month period. Liquidity Risk One of Ford Credits major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity. Global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper, the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables. Ford Credits ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings. Management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt, the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credits liquidity position is conducted periodically. For a detailed discussion of Ford Credits funding sources and debt ratings, see Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources." 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Operating Risk Ford Credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. Improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation. To address this risk, we and Ford Credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements, safeguard assets from misuse or theft, and ensure the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations. These controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with the Automotive sector incurring significant losses and the Financial Services sector providing offsetting profits. In addition, we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002. Similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the Revitalization Plan, we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade. 2002 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2002. While we hope to achieve these goals, they should not be interpreted as projections, expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are as follows: Restructuring Priorities 2002 Milestone Communicate/implement plans Report on progress Quality (U.S.) Improve J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey Capacity utilization (North America) Improve by 10% Non product related cost Reduce by $2 billion Divest non core operations $1 billion cash realization Financial Results Corporate Pre tax earnings (excluding unusual items) Positive Capital spending $7 billion Europe Improve results South America Improve results Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: increasing price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors; a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth or other factors; lower than anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products; currency or commodity price fluctuations; availability of fuel; a market shift from truck sales in the United States; lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; a credit rating downgrade, labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; insufficient credit loss reserves; and our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices. Our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility. For more information on these financial exposures, see Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below.
