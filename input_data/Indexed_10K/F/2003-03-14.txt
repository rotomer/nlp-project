Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The presentation below, consistent with our prior periodic reports, provides a geographic split of our Automotive operations, reflecting the results of our various automotive affiliates grouped by legal domicile. The results of our continuing operations exclude the results of discontinued and held for sale operations, which are described in Note 3 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. FOURTH QUARTER 2002 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide losses were $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, or $0.07 per diluted share of Common and Class B Stock. In the fourth quarter of 2001, losses were $5,068 million, including charges of $4,106 million primarily related to our Revitalization Plan, or $2.81 per diluted share. Worldwide sales and revenues were $41.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002, up $869 million, reflecting primarily improvement in net pricing and mix. Unit sales of cars and trucks were 1,791,000, down 21,000 units, due to reduced U.S. and European industry volume, and reduced U.S. market share, partially offset by a fourth quarter 2002 increase in U.S. dealer inventories (23,000 units) and the non recurrence of a reduction in U.S. dealer inventories in the fourth quarter of 2001 (101,000 units). Results of our operations by business sector for the fourth quarter of 2002 and 2001 are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Net Income/(Loss) 2002 Over/(Under) 2002 2001 2001 Automotive sector $ (342) $(4,667) $ 4,325 Financial Services sector 331 (364) 695 Income/(loss) from continuing operations (11) (5,031) 5,020 Income/(loss) from discontinued and held for sale operations * (15) (37) 22 Loss on disposal of discontinued and held for sale operations * (104) (104) Total Company net income/(loss) $ (130) $(5,068) $ 4,938 * See Note 3 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a discussion of these discontinued and held for sale operations. Automotive Sector Worldwide losses for our Automotive sector were $342 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 on sales of $34.7 billion. Losses in the fourth quarter of 2001 were $4,667 million on sales of $33.6 billion. Details of our geographic Automotive sector operations for the fourth quarter of 2002 and 2001 are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations 2002 Over/(Under) 2002 2001 2001 North American Automotive $ (49) $(4,024) $ 3,975 Automotive Outside North America Europe (363) 59 (422) South America (11) (598) 587 Rest of World 81 (104) 185 Total Automotive Outside North America (293) (643) 350 Total Automotive sector $ (342) $(4,667) $ 4,325 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The improved fourth quarter results in our North American automotive operations reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges that were primarily related to our Revitalization Plan, as well as improvements in cost performance (primarily lower costs related to warranty coverages and additional service actions), net revenue and vehicle mix. These were offset partially by lower unit sales volume in 2002 due primarily to lower U.S. industry demand (down 400,000 units to 17.1 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis) and lower market share (down 1.6 percentage points to 21.2%) for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles, compared with 2001 levels. The decrease in fourth quarter results in Europe reflected charges related to restructuring actions involving our Ford brand Europe and Premier Automotive Group operations, as well as a less favorable vehicle mix and lower production for dealer inventories. These were partially offset by a higher European market share (up 0.6 percentage points to 10.6%) for all vehicle brands. The fourth quarter restructuring charges in Europe discussed above totaled $117 million for Ford brand operations and $106 million for Premier Automotive Group operations, with each primarily reflecting employee separation costs. In the case of Ford brand operations, the employee separation costs were incurred primarily in preparation for the planned transfer of production of the Transit vehicle from our Genk, Belgium facility to a facility owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in Turkey Ford Otosan in which we have a 41% equity interest. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $11 million from operations in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with a loss of $598 million for the same period one year ago. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other restructuring charges that were largely related to our Revitalization Plan and the reversal of accruals related to trade tariffs as a result of the settlement between Brazil and Argentina of MERCOSUR trade balance rules. The results also reflected improved operating fundamentals, partially offset by lower industry volumes. The earnings improvement of $185 million in Rest of World reflected primarily the non recurrence of a Mazda pension related charge in the fourth quarter of 2001. Financial Services Sector Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations 2002 Over/(Under) 2002 2001 2001 Ford Credit $ 372 $(301) $ 673 Hertz 16 (58) 74 Minority interests and other (57) (5) (52) Total Financial Services sector $ 331 $(364) $ 695 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $372 million, compared with a loss of $301 million in 2001, which included charges associated with the Revitalization Plan ($204 million). Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement reflected a lower provision for credit losses, lower charges from hedging activities, and the net favorable impact of receivables sales, offset partially by lower net financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in the fourth quarter of 2002 were $16 million, compared with a loss of $58 million a year ago. The profit increase was primarily due to improved worldwide car rental volume and pricing, the continued recovery from the adverse impact the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 had on business travel during the fourth quarter of 2001, and cost reductions. 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Included in the $57 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. This partnership owns leased assets, primarily leveraged leases involving aircraft, power generation, rail, shipping, and telecommunications equipment. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $40 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft), which is in bankruptcy. FULL YEAR 2002 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide sales and revenues were $162.6 billion in 2002, up $1.8 billion from 2001. The increase is explained by higher Automotive revenues, reflecting higher unit sales volume and improved vehicle mix in North America, partially offset by lower financial services revenues resulting from increased sales of receivables. We sold 6,973,000 cars and trucks in 2002, down 35,000 units from 2001. Results of our operations by business sector for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Automotive Sector Financial Services Sector Total 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Income/(loss) from continuing operations $ (987) $(6,155) $ 3,664 $1,271 $ 806 $ 1,792 $ 284 $(5,349) $ 5,456 Income/(loss) from discontinued and held for sale operations (93) (112) 269 30 8 (6) (63) (104) 263 Loss on disposal of discontinued and held for sale operations (168) (2,252) (31) (199) (2,252) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle * (708) (294) (1,002) Total Company net income/(loss) $(1,956) $(6,267) $ 1,681 $ 976 $ 814 $ 1,786 $ (980) $(5,453) $ 3,467 * See Note 7 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment of goodwill pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, to which this relates. 43 Item 7.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector geographic earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 North American Automotive $ (278) $(5,488) $ 4,909 Automotive Outside North America Europe (725) 268 (1,115) South America (295) (776) (236) Rest of World 311 (159) 106 Total Automotive Outside North America (709) (667) (1,245) Total Automotive sector $ (987) $(6,155) $ 3,664 2002 Compared with 2001 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $987 million in 2002 on sales of $134.4 billion, compared with losses of $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion. Our automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $278 million in 2002 on sales of $94.1 billion, compared with losses of $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion. The improvement in earnings reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan, as well as the non recurrence of costs related to our 2001 Firestone tire replacement action (about $2 billion). Additionally, profits improved due to achievement of our 2002 milestone to reduce non product costs by $2 billion and the replenishment of dealer inventories in the U.S., which were unusually low at year end 2001. These improvements were partially offset by increased product related costs and lower market share. Net pricing (per vehicle, at constant mix) was about the same as 2001 levels, with pricing improvements being offset by higher variable marketing costs. In 2002, approximately 17.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.5 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 21.1% in 2002, down 1.7 percentage points from a year ago. The decline in market share reflected a number of factors, including an increase in the number of new competitive product offerings and our discontinuation of four vehicle lines (Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager, Lincoln Continental and most models of the Ford Escort). Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 15.8% of sales of those brands, up from 14.7% a year ago, reflecting continuing competitive pressures in the United States. Our automotive sector losses in Europe were $725 million from continuing operations in 2002, compared with earnings of $268 million a year ago. The decrease reflected primarily the loss related to our sale of Kwik Fit, charges related to restructuring actions involving our Ford brand Europe and Premier Automotive Group operations (discussed above), as well as a less favorable vehicle mix primarily at Jaguar and lower production to reduce dealer inventories. In 2002, approximately 17.2 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.8 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.9% in 2002, up 0.3 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to share improvement for Ford brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 8.7%), Jaguar brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 0.3%) and Volvo brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 1.4%). Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in South America were $295 million in 2002, compared with losses of $776 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan. The results also reflected the adverse effects of currency devaluation, partially offset by continuing improvement in operating fundamentals. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2002, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.6 million in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.3% in 2002, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago. The increase in market share reflected market acceptance of our new Ford Fiesta model and strong sales performance. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $311 million in 2002, compared with losses of $159 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 pension and restructuring related charges at Mazda, as well as net revenue and volume improvements throughout our Asia Pacific operations and operating improvements at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 824,000 units in 2002, up about 51,000 units from a year ago. In 2002, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 14.3%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2001, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures in the small car segment and the truck segment. 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion, compared with earnings of $3,664 million in 2000 on sales of $140.8 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion, compared with earnings of $4,909 million in 2000 on sales of $103.8 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased costs associated with warranty and additional service actions. In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $268 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,115 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $776 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $236 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In 2001, approximately 1.6 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.5 million in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 8.2% in 2001, down 1.4 percentage points compared 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with 2000. The decline in market share reflected new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for market share. Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $106 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Financial Services sector consists primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 Ford Credit $1,235 $ 831 $1,542 Hertz 127 23 358 Minority interests and other (91) (48) (108) Total Financial Services sector $1,271 $ 806 $1,792 2002 Compared with 2001 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations was $1,235 million, up $404 million from 2001. Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins. Revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that Ford Credit continues to service. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. In addition, the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that Ford Credit retains, our undivided interest in wholesale receivables, and other income related to interest only assets. Interest only assets, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. As shown below, total revenue related to receivables sales was $2,610 million in 2002, compared with $1,433 million and $557 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 resulted from the growth in Ford Credits outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years. Gains on sales of receivables in 2002 were about the same as those in 2001, reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold (about 1.9% in 2002, compared with 2.2% in 2001). Sales of receivables reduce Ford Credits financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold, as well as in future years, compared with what they otherwise would be if Ford Credit continued to own the receivables. These foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The improved fourth quarter results in our North American automotive operations reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges that were primarily related to our Revitalization Plan, as well as improvements in cost performance (primarily lower costs related to warranty coverages and additional service actions), net revenue and vehicle mix. These were offset partially by lower unit sales volume in 2002 due primarily to lower U.S. industry demand (down 400,000 units to 17.1 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis) and lower market share (down 1.6 percentage points to 21.2%) for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles, compared with 2001 levels. The decrease in fourth quarter results in Europe reflected charges related to restructuring actions involving our Ford brand Europe and Premier Automotive Group operations, as well as a less favorable vehicle mix and lower production for dealer inventories. These were partially offset by a higher European market share (up 0.6 percentage points to 10.6%) for all vehicle brands. The fourth quarter restructuring charges in Europe discussed above totaled $117 million for Ford brand operations and $106 million for Premier Automotive Group operations, with each primarily reflecting employee separation costs. In the case of Ford brand operations, the employee separation costs were incurred primarily in preparation for the planned transfer of production of the Transit vehicle from our Genk, Belgium facility to a facility owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in Turkey Ford Otosan in which we have a 41% equity interest. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $11 million from operations in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with a loss of $598 million for the same period one year ago. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other restructuring charges that were largely related to our Revitalization Plan and the reversal of accruals related to trade tariffs as a result of the settlement between Brazil and Argentina of MERCOSUR trade balance rules. The results also reflected improved operating fundamentals, partially offset by lower industry volumes. The earnings improvement of $185 million in Rest of World reflected primarily the non recurrence of a Mazda pension related charge in the fourth quarter of 2001. Financial Services Sector Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations are shown below (in millions): Fourth Quarter Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations 2002 Over/(Under) 2002 2001 2001 Ford Credit $ 372 $(301) $ 673 Hertz 16 (58) 74 Minority interests and other (57) (5) (52) Total Financial Services sector $ 331 $(364) $ 695 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $372 million, compared with a loss of $301 million in 2001, which included charges associated with the Revitalization Plan ($204 million). Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement reflected a lower provision for credit losses, lower charges from hedging activities, and the net favorable impact of receivables sales, offset partially by lower net financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in the fourth quarter of 2002 were $16 million, compared with a loss of $58 million a year ago. The profit increase was primarily due to improved worldwide car rental volume and pricing, the continued recovery from the adverse impact the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 had on business travel during the fourth quarter of 2001, and cost reductions. 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Included in the $57 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. This partnership owns leased assets, primarily leveraged leases involving aircraft, power generation, rail, shipping, and telecommunications equipment. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $40 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft), which is in bankruptcy. FULL YEAR 2002 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide sales and revenues were $162.6 billion in 2002, up $1.8 billion from 2001. The increase is explained by higher Automotive revenues, reflecting higher unit sales volume and improved vehicle mix in North America, partially offset by lower financial services revenues resulting from increased sales of receivables. We sold 6,973,000 cars and trucks in 2002, down 35,000 units from 2001. Results of our operations by business sector for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Automotive Sector Financial Services Sector Total 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Income/(loss) from continuing operations $ (987) $(6,155) $ 3,664 $1,271 $ 806 $ 1,792 $ 284 $(5,349) $ 5,456 Income/(loss) from discontinued and held for sale operations (93) (112) 269 30 8 (6) (63) (104) 263 Loss on disposal of discontinued and held for sale operations (168) (2,252) (31) (199) (2,252) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle * (708) (294) (1,002) Total Company net income/(loss) $(1,956) $(6,267) $ 1,681 $ 976 $ 814 $ 1,786 $ (980) $(5,453) $ 3,467 * See Note 7 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment of goodwill pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, to which this relates. 43 Item 7.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector geographic earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 North American Automotive $ (278) $(5,488) $ 4,909 Automotive Outside North America Europe (725) 268 (1,115) South America (295) (776) (236) Rest of World 311 (159) 106 Total Automotive Outside North America (709) (667) (1,245) Total Automotive sector $ (987) $(6,155) $ 3,664 2002 Compared with 2001 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $987 million in 2002 on sales of $134.4 billion, compared with losses of $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion. Our automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $278 million in 2002 on sales of $94.1 billion, compared with losses of $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion. The improvement in earnings reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan, as well as the non recurrence of costs related to our 2001 Firestone tire replacement action (about $2 billion). Additionally, profits improved due to achievement of our 2002 milestone to reduce non product costs by $2 billion and the replenishment of dealer inventories in the U.S., which were unusually low at year end 2001. These improvements were partially offset by increased product related costs and lower market share. Net pricing (per vehicle, at constant mix) was about the same as 2001 levels, with pricing improvements being offset by higher variable marketing costs. In 2002, approximately 17.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.5 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 21.1% in 2002, down 1.7 percentage points from a year ago. The decline in market share reflected a number of factors, including an increase in the number of new competitive product offerings and our discontinuation of four vehicle lines (Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager, Lincoln Continental and most models of the Ford Escort). Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 15.8% of sales of those brands, up from 14.7% a year ago, reflecting continuing competitive pressures in the United States. Our automotive sector losses in Europe were $725 million from continuing operations in 2002, compared with earnings of $268 million a year ago. The decrease reflected primarily the loss related to our sale of Kwik Fit, charges related to restructuring actions involving our Ford brand Europe and Premier Automotive Group operations (discussed above), as well as a less favorable vehicle mix primarily at Jaguar and lower production to reduce dealer inventories. In 2002, approximately 17.2 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.8 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.9% in 2002, up 0.3 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to share improvement for Ford brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 8.7%), Jaguar brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 0.3%) and Volvo brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 1.4%). Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in South America were $295 million in 2002, compared with losses of $776 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan. The results also reflected the adverse effects of currency devaluation, partially offset by continuing improvement in operating fundamentals. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2002, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.6 million in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.3% in 2002, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago. The increase in market share reflected market acceptance of our new Ford Fiesta model and strong sales performance. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $311 million in 2002, compared with losses of $159 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 pension and restructuring related charges at Mazda, as well as net revenue and volume improvements throughout our Asia Pacific operations and operating improvements at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 824,000 units in 2002, up about 51,000 units from a year ago. In 2002, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 14.3%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2001, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures in the small car segment and the truck segment. 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion, compared with earnings of $3,664 million in 2000 on sales of $140.8 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion, compared with earnings of $4,909 million in 2000 on sales of $103.8 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased costs associated with warranty and additional service actions. In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $268 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,115 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $776 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $236 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In 2001, approximately 1.6 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.5 million in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 8.2% in 2001, down 1.4 percentage points compared 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with 2000. The decline in market share reflected new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for market share. Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $106 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Financial Services sector consists primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 Ford Credit $1,235 $ 831 $1,542 Hertz 127 23 358 Minority interests and other (91) (48) (108) Total Financial Services sector $1,271 $ 806 $1,792 2002 Compared with 2001 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations was $1,235 million, up $404 million from 2001. Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins. Revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that Ford Credit continues to service. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. In addition, the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that Ford Credit retains, our undivided interest in wholesale receivables, and other income related to interest only assets. Interest only assets, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. As shown below, total revenue related to receivables sales was $2,610 million in 2002, compared with $1,433 million and $557 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 resulted from the growth in Ford Credits outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years. Gains on sales of receivables in 2002 were about the same as those in 2001, reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold (about 1.9% in 2002, compared with 2.2% in 2001). Sales of receivables reduce Ford Credits financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold, as well as in future years, compared with what they otherwise would be if Ford Credit continued to own the receivables. These foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U.

The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Included in the $57 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. This partnership owns leased assets, primarily leveraged leases involving aircraft, power generation, rail, shipping, and telecommunications equipment. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $40 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft), which is in bankruptcy. FULL YEAR 2002 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our worldwide sales and revenues were $162.6 billion in 2002, up $1.8 billion from 2001. The increase is explained by higher Automotive revenues, reflecting higher unit sales volume and improved vehicle mix in North America, partially offset by lower financial services revenues resulting from increased sales of receivables. We sold 6,973,000 cars and trucks in 2002, down 35,000 units from 2001.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector geographic earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 North American Automotive $ (278) $(5,488) $ 4,909 Automotive Outside North America Europe (725) 268 (1,115) South America (295) (776) (236) Rest of World 311 (159) 106 Total Automotive Outside North America (709) (667) (1,245) Total Automotive sector $ (987) $(6,155) $ 3,664 2002 Compared with 2001 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $987 million in 2002 on sales of $134.4 billion, compared with losses of $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion. Our automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $278 million in 2002 on sales of $94.1 billion, compared with losses of $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion. The improvement in earnings reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan, as well as the non recurrence of costs related to our 2001 Firestone tire replacement action (about $2 billion). Additionally, profits improved due to achievement of our 2002 milestone to reduce non product costs by $2 billion and the replenishment of dealer inventories in the U.S., which were unusually low at year end 2001. These improvements were partially offset by increased product related costs and lower market share. Net pricing (per vehicle, at constant mix) was about the same as 2001 levels, with pricing improvements being offset by higher variable marketing costs. In 2002, approximately 17.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.5 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 21.1% in 2002, down 1.7 percentage points from a year ago. The decline in market share reflected a number of factors, including an increase in the number of new competitive product offerings and our discontinuation of four vehicle lines (Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager, Lincoln Continental and most models of the Ford Escort). Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 15.8% of sales of those brands, up from 14.7% a year ago, reflecting continuing competitive pressures in the United States. Our automotive sector losses in Europe were $725 million from continuing operations in 2002, compared with earnings of $268 million a year ago. The decrease reflected primarily the loss related to our sale of Kwik Fit, charges related to restructuring actions involving our Ford brand Europe and Premier Automotive Group operations (discussed above), as well as a less favorable vehicle mix primarily at Jaguar and lower production to reduce dealer inventories. In 2002, approximately 17.2 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.8 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.9% in 2002, up 0.3 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to share improvement for Ford brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 8.7%), Jaguar brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 0.3%) and Volvo brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 1.4%). Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in South America were $295 million in 2002, compared with losses of $776 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan. The results also reflected the adverse effects of currency devaluation, partially offset by continuing improvement in operating fundamentals. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2002, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.6 million in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.3% in 2002, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago. The increase in market share reflected market acceptance of our new Ford Fiesta model and strong sales performance. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $311 million in 2002, compared with losses of $159 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 pension and restructuring related charges at Mazda, as well as net revenue and volume improvements throughout our Asia Pacific operations and operating improvements at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 824,000 units in 2002, up about 51,000 units from a year ago. In 2002, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 14.3%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2001, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures in the small car segment and the truck segment. 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion, compared with earnings of $3,664 million in 2000 on sales of $140.8 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion, compared with earnings of $4,909 million in 2000 on sales of $103.8 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased costs associated with warranty and additional service actions. In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $268 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,115 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $776 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $236 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In 2001, approximately 1.6 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.5 million in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 8.2% in 2001, down 1.4 percentage points compared 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with 2000. The decline in market share reflected new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for market share. Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $106 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Financial Services sector consists primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 Ford Credit $1,235 $ 831 $1,542 Hertz 127 23 358 Minority interests and other (91) (48) (108) Total Financial Services sector $1,271 $ 806 $1,792 2002 Compared with 2001 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations was $1,235 million, up $404 million from 2001. Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins. Revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that Ford Credit continues to service. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. In addition, the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that Ford Credit retains, our undivided interest in wholesale receivables, and other income related to interest only assets. Interest only assets, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. As shown below, total revenue related to receivables sales was $2,610 million in 2002, compared with $1,433 million and $557 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 resulted from the growth in Ford Credits outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years. Gains on sales of receivables in 2002 were about the same as those in 2001, reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold (about 1.9% in 2002, compared with 2.2% in 2001). Sales of receivables reduce Ford Credits financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold, as well as in future years, compared with what they otherwise would be if Ford Credit continued to own the receivables. These foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector geographic earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 North American Automotive $ (278) $(5,488) $ 4,909 Automotive Outside North America Europe (725) 268 (1,115) South America (295) (776) (236) Rest of World 311 (159) 106 Total Automotive Outside North America (709) (667) (1,245) Total Automotive sector $ (987) $(6,155) $ 3,664 2002 Compared with 2001 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $987 million in 2002 on sales of $134.4 billion, compared with losses of $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion. Our automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $278 million in 2002 on sales of $94.1 billion, compared with losses of $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion. The improvement in earnings reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan, as well as the non recurrence of costs related to our 2001 Firestone tire replacement action (about $2 billion). Additionally, profits improved due to achievement of our 2002 milestone to reduce non product costs by $2 billion and the replenishment of dealer inventories in the U.S., which were unusually low at year end 2001. These improvements were partially offset by increased product related costs and lower market share. Net pricing (per vehicle, at constant mix) was about the same as 2001 levels, with pricing improvements being offset by higher variable marketing costs. In 2002, approximately 17.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.5 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 21.1% in 2002, down 1.7 percentage points from a year ago. The decline in market share reflected a number of factors, including an increase in the number of new competitive product offerings and our discontinuation of four vehicle lines (Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager, Lincoln Continental and most models of the Ford Escort). Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 15.8% of sales of those brands, up from 14.7% a year ago, reflecting continuing competitive pressures in the United States. Our automotive sector losses in Europe were $725 million from continuing operations in 2002, compared with earnings of $268 million a year ago. The decrease reflected primarily the loss related to our sale of Kwik Fit, charges related to restructuring actions involving our Ford brand Europe and Premier Automotive Group operations (discussed above), as well as a less favorable vehicle mix primarily at Jaguar and lower production to reduce dealer inventories. In 2002, approximately 17.2 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.8 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.9% in 2002, up 0.3 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to share improvement for Ford brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 8.7%), Jaguar brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 0.3%) and Volvo brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 1.4%). Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in South America were $295 million in 2002, compared with losses of $776 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan. The results also reflected the adverse effects of currency devaluation, partially offset by continuing improvement in operating fundamentals. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2002, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.6 million in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.3% in 2002, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago. The increase in market share reflected market acceptance of our new Ford Fiesta model and strong sales performance. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $311 million in 2002, compared with losses of $159 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 pension and restructuring related charges at Mazda, as well as net revenue and volume improvements throughout our Asia Pacific operations and operating improvements at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 824,000 units in 2002, up about 51,000 units from a year ago. In 2002, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 14.3%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2001, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures in the small car segment and the truck segment. 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion, compared with earnings of $3,664 million in 2000 on sales of $140.8 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion, compared with earnings of $4,909 million in 2000 on sales of $103.8 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased costs associated with warranty and additional service actions. In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $268 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,115 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $776 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $236 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In 2001, approximately 1.6 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.5 million in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 8.2% in 2001, down 1.4 percentage points compared 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with 2000. The decline in market share reflected new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for market share. Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $106 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Financial Services sector consists primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 Ford Credit $1,235 $ 831 $1,542 Hertz 127 23 358 Minority interests and other (91) (48) (108) Total Financial Services sector $1,271 $ 806 $1,792 2002 Compared with 2001 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations was $1,235 million, up $404 million from 2001. Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins. Revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that Ford Credit continues to service. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. In addition, the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that Ford Credit retains, our undivided interest in wholesale receivables, and other income related to interest only assets. Interest only assets, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. As shown below, total revenue related to receivables sales was $2,610 million in 2002, compared with $1,433 million and $557 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 resulted from the growth in Ford Credits outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years. Gains on sales of receivables in 2002 were about the same as those in 2001, reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold (about 1.9% in 2002, compared with 2.2% in 2001). Sales of receivables reduce Ford Credits financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold, as well as in future years, compared with what they otherwise would be if Ford Credit continued to own the receivables. These foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of our Automotive sector geographic earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 North American Automotive $ (278) $(5,488) $ 4,909 Automotive Outside North America Europe (725) 268 (1,115) South America (295) (776) (236) Rest of World 311 (159) 106 Total Automotive Outside North America (709) (667) (1,245) Total Automotive sector $ (987) $(6,155) $ 3,664 2002 Compared with 2001 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $987 million in 2002 on sales of $134.4 billion, compared with losses of $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion. Our automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $278 million in 2002 on sales of $94.1 billion, compared with losses of $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion. The improvement in earnings reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan, as well as the non recurrence of costs related to our 2001 Firestone tire replacement action (about $2 billion). Additionally, profits improved due to achievement of our 2002 milestone to reduce non product costs by $2 billion and the replenishment of dealer inventories in the U.S., which were unusually low at year end 2001. These improvements were partially offset by increased product related costs and lower market share. Net pricing (per vehicle, at constant mix) was about the same as 2001 levels, with pricing improvements being offset by higher variable marketing costs. In 2002, approximately 17.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.5 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 21.1% in 2002, down 1.7 percentage points from a year ago. The decline in market share reflected a number of factors, including an increase in the number of new competitive product offerings and our discontinuation of four vehicle lines (Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager, Lincoln Continental and most models of the Ford Escort). Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 15.8% of sales of those brands, up from 14.7% a year ago, reflecting continuing competitive pressures in the United States. Our automotive sector losses in Europe were $725 million from continuing operations in 2002, compared with earnings of $268 million a year ago. The decrease reflected primarily the loss related to our sale of Kwik Fit, charges related to restructuring actions involving our Ford brand Europe and Premier Automotive Group operations (discussed above), as well as a less favorable vehicle mix primarily at Jaguar and lower production to reduce dealer inventories. In 2002, approximately 17.2 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.8 million units in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.9% in 2002, up 0.3 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to share improvement for Ford brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 8.7%), Jaguar brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 0.3%) and Volvo brand vehicles (up 0.1 percentage points to 1.4%). Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in South America were $295 million in 2002, compared with losses of $776 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 asset impairments and other one time charges largely related to our Revitalization Plan. The results also reflected the adverse effects of currency devaluation, partially offset by continuing improvement in operating fundamentals. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2002, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.6 million in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.3% in 2002, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago. The increase in market share reflected market acceptance of our new Ford Fiesta model and strong sales performance. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $311 million in 2002, compared with losses of $159 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 pension and restructuring related charges at Mazda, as well as net revenue and volume improvements throughout our Asia Pacific operations and operating improvements at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 824,000 units in 2002, up about 51,000 units from a year ago. In 2002, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 14.3%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2001, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures in the small car segment and the truck segment. 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion, compared with earnings of $3,664 million in 2000 on sales of $140.8 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion, compared with earnings of $4,909 million in 2000 on sales of $103.8 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased costs associated with warranty and additional service actions. In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $268 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,115 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $776 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $236 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In 2001, approximately 1.6 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.5 million in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 8.2% in 2001, down 1.4 percentage points compared 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with 2000. The decline in market share reflected new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for market share. Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $106 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Financial Services sector consists primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 Ford Credit $1,235 $ 831 $1,542 Hertz 127 23 358 Minority interests and other (91) (48) (108) Total Financial Services sector $1,271 $ 806 $1,792 2002 Compared with 2001 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations was $1,235 million, up $404 million from 2001. Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins. Revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that Ford Credit continues to service. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. In addition, the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that Ford Credit retains, our undivided interest in wholesale receivables, and other income related to interest only assets. Interest only assets, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. As shown below, total revenue related to receivables sales was $2,610 million in 2002, compared with $1,433 million and $557 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 resulted from the growth in Ford Credits outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years. Gains on sales of receivables in 2002 were about the same as those in 2001, reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold (about 1.9% in 2002, compared with 2.2% in 2001). Sales of receivables reduce Ford Credits financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold, as well as in future years, compared with what they otherwise would be if Ford Credit continued to own the receivables. These foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2002, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.6 million in 2001. Our share of those unit sales was 10.3% in 2002, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago. The increase in market share reflected market acceptance of our new Ford Fiesta model and strong sales performance. Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $311 million in 2002, compared with losses of $159 million in 2001. The improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the 2001 pension and restructuring related charges at Mazda, as well as net revenue and volume improvements throughout our Asia Pacific operations and operating improvements at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 824,000 units in 2002, up about 51,000 units from a year ago. In 2002, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 14.3%, down 0.8 percentage points from 2001, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures in the small car segment and the truck segment. 2001 Compared with 2000 Worldwide losses from continuing operations for our Automotive sector were $6,155 million in 2001 on sales of $130.8 billion, compared with earnings of $3,664 million in 2000 on sales of $140.8 billion. Adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our Firestone tire replacement action, our total costs in the Automotive sector increased $1.0 billion compared with 2000. Our Automotive sector losses from continuing operations in North America were $5,488 million in 2001 on sales of $90.8 billion, compared with earnings of $4,909 million in 2000 on sales of $103.8 billion. The earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes, the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly increased marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement action and increased costs associated with warranty and additional service actions. In 2001, approximately 17.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, down from 17.8 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 22.8% in 2001, down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments, as well as the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese competitors. Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased to 14.7% of sales of those brands, up from 11.1% a year ago, reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs (such as 0.0% financing during the fourth quarter), cash rebates and other incentive programs. Our Automotive sector earnings in Europe were $268 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with losses of $1,115 million a year ago. The increase reflected the non recurrence of the 2000 charge related to asset impairments and restructuring, as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the effect on depreciation from last years asset impairment and restructuring actions. In 2001, approximately 17.8 million new cars and trucks were sold in our nineteen primary European markets, down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001, up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford brand Mondeo and Transit models and our acquisition of Land Rover. Our Automotive sector losses in South America were $776 million from continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $236 million in 2000. The decrease is more than explained by asset impairment charges and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In 2001, approximately 1.6 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil, compared with 1.5 million in 2000. Our share of those unit sales was 8.2% in 2001, down 1.4 percentage points compared 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with 2000. The decline in market share reflected new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for market share. Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $106 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Financial Services sector consists primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 Ford Credit $1,235 $ 831 $1,542 Hertz 127 23 358 Minority interests and other (91) (48) (108) Total Financial Services sector $1,271 $ 806 $1,792 2002 Compared with 2001 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations was $1,235 million, up $404 million from 2001. Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins. Revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that Ford Credit continues to service. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. In addition, the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that Ford Credit retains, our undivided interest in wholesale receivables, and other income related to interest only assets. Interest only assets, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. As shown below, total revenue related to receivables sales was $2,610 million in 2002, compared with $1,433 million and $557 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 resulted from the growth in Ford Credits outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years. Gains on sales of receivables in 2002 were about the same as those in 2001, reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold (about 1.9% in 2002, compared with 2.2% in 2001). Sales of receivables reduce Ford Credits financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold, as well as in future years, compared with what they otherwise would be if Ford Credit continued to own the receivables. These foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with 2000. The decline in market share reflected new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for market share. Automotive sector losses from continuing operations outside North America, Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001, compared with earnings of $106 million in 2000. The earnings deterioration reflected Fords share of a non cash charge relating to Mazdas pension expenses and other restructuring actions at Mazda. New car and truck sales in Australia, our largest market in Rest of World, were approximately 773,000 units in 2001, down about 14,000 units from a year ago. In 2001, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.1%, down 0.6 percentage points from 2000, reflecting primarily share deterioration in the full size car segment due to continued aggressive competition. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Financial Services sector consists primarily of two segments, Ford Credit and Hertz. Details of our Financial Services sector earnings from continuing operations for 2002, 2001, and 2000 are shown below (in millions): Income/(Loss)from Continuing Operations 2002 2001 2000 Ford Credit $1,235 $ 831 $1,542 Hertz 127 23 358 Minority interests and other (91) (48) (108) Total Financial Services sector $1,271 $ 806 $1,792 2002 Compared with 2001 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations was $1,235 million, up $404 million from 2001. Apart from the non recurrence of last years Revitalization Plan charges, the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins. Revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that Ford Credit continues to service. Gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold. In addition, the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that Ford Credit retains, our undivided interest in wholesale receivables, and other income related to interest only assets. Interest only assets, also referred to as excess spread, represent Ford Credits right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees. As shown below, total revenue related to receivables sales was $2,610 million in 2002, compared with $1,433 million and $557 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 resulted from the growth in Ford Credits outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years. Gains on sales of receivables in 2002 were about the same as those in 2001, reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold (about 1.9% in 2002, compared with 2.2% in 2001). Sales of receivables reduce Ford Credits financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold, as well as in future years, compared with what they otherwise would be if Ford Credit continued to own the receivables. These foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables. The net impact of securitizations on Ford Credits revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount, type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period, as well as the interest 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized. The following table shows the estimated after tax impact of sales of receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions for the years indicated, net of the effect of reduced financing margins resulting from the foregone revenue attributable to the sold receivables (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sales of receivables $ 728 $ 739 $ 14 SFAS No. 133 fair value basis adjustment (199) (327) Net gain on sales of receivables $ 529 $ 412 $ 14 Servicing fees 700 456 190 Interest income from retained securities 606 379 152 Excess spread and other 775 186 201 Total revenue related to receivables sales $2,610 $1,433 $ 557 Reduction in financing margin from current year securitizations* (968) (1,059) (243) Reduction in financing margin from prior year securitizations* (1,967) (611) (521) Pre tax impact of receivable sales (325) (237) (207) Tax 120 88 77 After tax impact of receivable sales $ (205) $ (149) $(130) Memo: After tax impact of sales of receivables excluding SFAS No. 133 $ (79) $ 57 $(130) * Calculated on a basis using a borrowing cost equal to the actual financing rate paid to securitization investors, which was significantly lower than Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt for the years presented. If calculated on a basis using Ford Credits average borrowing cost for unsecured debt, the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown. Earnings at Hertz in 2002, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $127 million. The Hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at Ford FSG, Inc., Hertz parent company, which is not applicable to Hertz financial statements. Results for Hertz in 2002 included a $294 million non cash charge related to impairment of goodwill in Hertz industrial and construction equipment rental business in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2001, Hertz had earnings of $23 million. The increase in earnings, before the change in accounting principle, was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs. Included in the $91 million loss for "minority interests and other" within the Financial Services sector for 2002 is an after tax charge related to our equity interest in a partnership that holds diversified financing assets. These are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of USL Capital Corporation in 1996. The charge, totaling $95 million after tax, is specifically related to aircraft leases to United Airlines (twelve aircraft) and US Airways (five aircraft) which are in bankruptcy, and telecommunications equipment leases to a WorldCom subsidiary. In all, the partnership has leased 69 aircraft to 11 lessees, primarily to U.S. based airlines; our share of the partnerships remaining investment in aircraft leases is about $350 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Ford Credits consolidated income from continuing operations in 2001 was $831 million, down $711 million or 46% from 2000. Excluding Ford Credits share of the charges associated with the Revitalization Plan, net income was about $1 billion, down $507 million compared with 2000, due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of SFAS No. 133 from hedging activity, offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions, higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins. Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million. In 2000, Hertz had earnings of $358 million. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the United States, reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the United States economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Automotive Sector For the Automotive sector, liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances, cash generated from operations, our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines. Gross Cash Automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust, which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term, as summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 4.1 $ 3.4 Marketable securities 17.4 10.9 13.1 VEBA 2.7 2.7 3.7 Gross cash $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 In managing our business, we classify changes in gross cash in three categories: operating (including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the Financial Services sector), acquisitions and divestitures, and financing. Changes for the last three years are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross cash at end of period $25.3 $17.7 $20.2 Gross cash at beginning of period 17.7 20.2 25.4 Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) Operating related cash flows Automotive net income/(loss) $(2.0) $(6.3) $ 1.7 Non cash, one time charges 1.7 4.3 3.5 Depreciation and special tools amortization 4.9 5.0 5.1 Changes in receivables, inventory and trade payables (1.8) 4.4 (0.5) Other primarily expense and payment timing differences 3.8 (0.1) 3.7 Capital transactions with Financial Services sector * 0.4 0.4 0.7 Capital expenditures (6.8) (6.3) (7.4) Total operating related cash flows before tax refunds 0.2 1.4 6.8 Tax refunds 2.6 Total operating related cash flows 2.8 1.4 6.8 Divestitures and asset sales 0.9 0.4 Acquisitions and capital contributions (0.3) (2.7) (2.7) Financing related cash flows Convertible trust preferred securities 4.9 Value Enhancement Plan (5.6) Dividends to shareholders (0.7) (1.9) (2.8) Net issuance/(purchase) of stock 0.1 (1.4) (1.2) Changes in total Automotive Sector debt (0.1) 1.7 0.3 Total financing related cash flows 4.2 (1.6) (9.3) Total change in gross cash $ 7.6 $(2.5) $(5.2) * Includes the net of capital contributions, dividends, loans and loan repayments. In 2002, we had non cash one time charges of $1.7 billion, reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, but requires annual testing for impairment), losses on the sales of Kwik Fit and other businesses, and restructuring charges in our Ford brand European Automotive operations and Premier Automotive Group operations. Timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows. In 2002, these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by $3.8 billion, denoted as 49 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) "Other" in the table above. These timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care, marketing, warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made. In 2002, we spent $6.8 billion for Automotive sector capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. This was up $500 million from 2001, reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization. Capital expenditures were 5.0% of sales in 2002, up 0.2 percentage points from a year ago. During 2002, we received $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.5% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and about $2.6 billion of income tax refunds. These two factors alone explain substantially all of the $7.6 billion increase in our gross cash balances during 2002. Capital transactions with the Financial Services sector improved cash flow by $400 million, reflecting primarily dividends from Ford Credit, net of a $700 million cash contribution from Ford indirectly to Ford Credit in January 2002. Shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading (in billions): Full Year 2002 2001 Operating related cash flows $ 2.8 $ 1.4 Items Ford includes in operating related cash flow Capital transactions with Financial Services sector (0.4) (0.4) Capital expenditures 6.8 6.3 Net transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors * 0.1 (0.6) Other, primarily exclusion of cash in flows from VEBA draw down 0.2 0.8 Total reconciling items 6.7 6.1 Cash flows from operating activities before securities trading $ 9.5 $ 7.5 * Primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business, as shown in our sector statement of cash flows. Debt and Net Cash At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had total debt of $14.2 billion, up $400 million from a year ago. The weighted average maturity of our long term debt, substantially all of which is fixed rate debt, is approximately 27 years with about $1.1 billion maturing by December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of total debt (long term and short term) is approximately 26 years. At December 31, 2002, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash less total debt) of $11.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion and $8.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2002, the Automotive sector had $7.8 billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks; eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through June 30, 2007. Ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis $7.2 billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit or FCE Bank, plc, Ford Credits European operation ("FCE"). All of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow). Approximately $100 million of these facilities were in use at December 31, 2002. Other Securities Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I and Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II together have outstanding an aggregate $5.7 billion of trust preferred securities as described in Note 14 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. These securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2002, we redeemed our Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $177 million. 50 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Services Sector Ford Credit Debt and Cash Ford Credits total debt was $140.3 billion at December 31, 2002, down $5.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford Credits outstanding commercial paper (not including commercial paper issued to affiliates) at December 31, 2002 totaled $8.2 billion. The average remaining maturity of Ford Credits commercial paper in North America and Europe was 34 days. At December 31, 2002, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion. In the normal course of its funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs. This excess funding is referred to as "overborrowings." Of the $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $5 billion represented overborrowings, while the remaining $1.8 billion was employed in operating activities. Funding Ford Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford Credits funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford products, which to a large extent are influenced by Ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay its debt obligations. Funding sources for Ford Credit include the sale of commercial paper, issuance of term debt, the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and, in the case of FCE, the issuance of certificates of deposit. These funds are obtained from investors in various markets. Ford Credits commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs. Ford Credit has commercial paper programs in the United States, Europe, Canada and other international markets. It reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from $15.7 billion at the end of 2001 to $8.2 billion ($3.4 billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other Ford affiliates) at December 31, 2002 by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion, net of overborrowings. Ford Credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination, floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market Account program. At December 31, 2002, $5.1 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets. Long term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the United States and international capital markets. During 2002, Ford Credit issued approximately $13.5 billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years. During 2003, Ford Credit plans to raise $7 billion to $10 billion through term debt issuances and $12 billion to $15 billion through public term securitization transactions, which are discussed below. Other sources of funds include bank borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed. During 2002, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities, their lower relative cost (as described below), and the diversification of funding sources that they provide. Ford Credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources, including retail unsecured bond issuances, new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs. In addition, Ford Credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements. Under the whole loan sale program, Ford Credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans. Ford Credit sold $5 billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of 2002, and expects to complete further sales in 2003. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. Accordingly, Ford Credit does not treat such receivables as "managed receivables" and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below. 51 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) As a result of Ford Credits expanded securitization sources and other actions, the decline in debt ratings Ford Credit experienced in 2002 and 2001 did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Any further lowering of Ford Credits debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets. This in turn likely would cause Ford Credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions, or to reduce its assets and liabilities. Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. The cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate or interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities. Spreads are typically measured in basis points, where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Since 1998, the three year fixed rate spread on Ford Credits securitized funding has been at a level between 38 and 110 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between 46 basis points and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. In 2002, Ford Credits unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between 195 and 662 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, with an average spread of 357 basis points and a year end spread of 375 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Ford Credits worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended December 31 (in billions): Receivable Type 2002 2001 2000 Retail $36.5 $32.0 $19.2 Wholesale 4.8 8.8 0.3 Net Proceeds... $41.3 $40.8 $19.5 For additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2002, including $5.3 billion available for FCE. The majority of these facilities are available through June 30, 2007 and $900 million was in use at December 31, 2002 (primarily by affiliates outside of the United States and Europe). In addition, banks provide $13.6 billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credits asset backed commercial paper programs. All of Ford Credits global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow). Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored, commercial paper issuers (conduits) under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from Ford Credit or hold, at Ford Credits option, up to an aggregate of $12.6 billion of receivables. These agreements have varying maturity dates between March 31, 2003 and October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion of these commitments were used. These programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements) or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables, but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels. None of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating. For a discussion of the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46") on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities", below. 52 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) At December 31, 2002, Ford Credits debt to equity ratio was 12.8 to 1 on a managed basis (excluding the effect of Axus, our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation, that was held for sale), down from 14.8 to 1 at December 31, 2001. In calculating its managed leverage, Ford Credit adds outstanding securitized receivables (but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions) to debt, and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash, including overborrowings. Ford Credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the calculation of managed leverage because SFAS No. 133 adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures. Hertz Hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment, which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment. Hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry. Hertz fleet size, and its related financing requirements, generally peak in the months of June and July, and decline during the months of December and January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs. Hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs, and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business practice, to fund international needs. Hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets. During 2002, Hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources. As of December 31, 2002, $514 million was outstanding under this program. At December 31, 2002, Hertz had committed credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion. Of this amount, $1.4 billion represented global and other committed credit facilities ($0.9 billion of which are available through June 30, 2007 and $0.5 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $500 million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2004; $215 million consisted of asset backed Letters of Credit, and $928 million consisted of 364 day asset backed commercial paper facilities. Total Company Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002, down $2.2 billion compared with December 31, 2001. As described below, changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by $5.3 billion, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $2.9 billion. Our stockholders equity also was reduced in 2002 by net losses of $980 million and dividend payments of $743 million. Post Retirement Obligations We sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities. For our major U.S. pension funds, the target asset allocation is 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. On December 31, 2002, the market value of our U.S. pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations (calculated using a discount rate of 6.75%, which is reduced from 7.25% used at year end 2001) by $7.3 billion for our U.S. plans. For non U.S. plans, the shortfall as of December 31, 2002, was $8.3 billion, for a total worldwide shortfall of $15.6 billion. Our stockholders equity was reduced by $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 because of increased pension under funding. Pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, and benefit levels (which can be contractually specified, such as those under the Ford UAW Retirement Plan that is subject to negotiation in 2003). If these assumptions were to remain unchanged, we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans 53 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) before 2007. However, we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required. For example, in January 2003 we contributed $500 million in cash to the U.S. pension funds and, depending on a determination that it will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, expect to contribute an additional $500 million by June 2003. Further, after giving effect to these contributions, based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions, we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before 2005. We sponsor post retirement health care plans, primarily in the U.S. We partially fund these obligations through a VEBA trust, which is invested in short term fixed income investments. Debt Ratings Our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"); Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"); and Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies. Debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue, and are based on information provided by us or other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Long and short term debt ratings of BBB and F3 or higher by Fitch, Baa3 and P 3 or higher by Moodys and BBB and A3 or higher by S&P are considered "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. Fitch Ratings. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz from A to BBB+, confirmed Ford Credits and Hertz short term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all three companies as negative. On October 31, 2002, Fitch affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz at BBB+, short term debt ratings at F2 and its rating outlook as negative. Moodys Ratings. On January 16, 2002, Moodys lowered Fords long term debt rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credits long and short term debt ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime 1 to Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. Moodys also lowered Hertz long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short term debt rating at Prime 2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative. On December 10, 2002, Moodys confirmed Hertz long term debt rating at Baa2, short term debt rating at Prime 2 and its rating outlook is negative. On March 7, 2003, Moodys affirmed the long term debt rating of Ford at Baa1 and long and short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A3 and Prime 2, respectively, and confirmed the rating outlook of both companies as negative. S&P Ratings. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for Ford, Ford Credit and Hertz to negative. On October 16, 2002, S&P placed Ford, Ford Credit and Hertzs long term debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The short term debt rating of Ford Credit was reaffirmed at A2. On October 25, 2002, S&P lowered the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit from BBB+ to BBB. It affirmed the short term debt ratings of Ford Credit at A2. S&P stated that its rating outlook on us was negative and that is was concerned that the benefits of our Revitalization Plan could eventually be offset by decreasing industry demand in North America, industry wide price competition and Fords market share weakness. S&P also indicated that its ratings on Ford could be lowered further if it comes to doubt Fords ability to sustain earnings improvement, including the achievement of at least breakeven per tax earnings in our Automotive operations in 2003. On October 30, 2002, S&P affirmed Hertz long term debt rating at BBB and its short term debt rating at A2. On March 7, 2003, S&P affirmed the long term debt ratings of Ford and Ford Credit at BBB and the short term debt rating of Ford Credit at A2. The outlook for all companies is negative. 54 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. These include guarantees, sales of receivables by Ford Credit, and variable interest entities, each of which is discussed below. Guarantees (See also Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Occasionally, we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth. As of December 31, 2002, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $486 million. In the ordinary course of business, we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction. These indemnifications include claims for any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment related matters; financial matters; and dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim. Sales of Receivables by Ford Credit Securitizations Ford Credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations. Ford Credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. Ford Credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from Ford franchised dealers and non Ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories, generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables. Ford Credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases. In 2002, Ford Credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries. In a typical securitization, Ford Credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity ("SPE") and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. Following the transfer of the sold receivables to the SPE, the receivables are no longer assets of Ford Credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest bearing securities, usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates, which are paid by the SPE from future collections on the receivables it owns. These securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, are structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization, excess spread and cash reserve funds. These securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions. Ford Credit uses SPEs in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors. Assuming, accounting rules are met, the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet. The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to issue senor securities (typically with a higher debt rating than Ford Credits debt securities) in a highly liquid and efficient market, thereby providing Ford Credit with a cost effective source of funding. The two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the SPE is conventional in the asset backed securitization market. Most of the SPEs used in Ford Credits securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities. Ford Credit also sponsors one securitization SPE, FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), that is not a qualifying SPE under SFAS No. 140 55 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited. However, because FCAR maintains substantive third party equity, this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2002 under applicable accounting rules. However, see " Variable Interest Entities" below and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on Ford Credits FCAR securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by Ford Credit. None of our or Ford Credits officers, directors or employees holds any equity interest in the SPEs or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the SPEs. The SPEs do not own stock in either Ford or Ford Credit or any of their affiliates. Ford Credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables. The retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities, undivided interests in wholesale receivables, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and interest only strips. Subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the SPEs. Restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to SPE investors and, after investors are fully paid, remaining cash is returned to Ford Credit. Interest only strips, also referred to as excess spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other required payments. The subordinated securities, restricted cash, interest only strips, and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by Ford Credit in securitizations was $71.3 billion and $58.7 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credits retained interests in such sold receivables were $17.6 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Ford Credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default. The holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit to repurchase their securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities issued by SPEs. However, as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions, Ford Credit, as the seller of the finance receivables to the SPE and servicer of such receivables, is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations include indemnification of the SPE and its trustees, the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer, the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls. Based on its experience, Ford Credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments. In 2002, Ford Credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about $340 million for all retail securitization programs. Whole loan Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit sold about $5 billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions. In addition, Ford Credit is contractually committed to sell an additional $2 billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of 2003 through a whole loan sale transaction. In respect of whole loan sale transactions, Ford Credit generally has the same indemnification, repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions. These continuing obligations are discussed above. Ford Credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee. Unlike securitizations, however, whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without Ford Credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables. Because Ford Credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program, it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables. No SPEs are used in Ford Credits whole loan sale program. 56 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risks to Future Sales of Receivables Some of Ford Credits securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on Ford Credits overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels. Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables. In addition, Ford Credits ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions, general demand for the type of receivables Ford Credit offers, market capacity for Ford Credit sponsored investments, market disruption and Ford Credits debt ratings. If as a result of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to Ford Credit, its liquidity would be adversely impacted. Variable Interest Entities (See also Item 2. "Properties" and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements) Automotive Our Automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments. In many cases, we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components. We have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost, high quality parts and vehicles, world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners. These investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest. In some cases, we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity; in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing. In many cases, labor used by the joint ventures are Ford employees, the cost of which we are reimbursed; however, failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees. The terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation. For a discussion of the impact of FIN 46 on our accounting for these joint ventures, see Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Financial Services It is reasonably possible that FCAR, in its existing structure, may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with FIN 46. Our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to FCAR is approximately $1.7 billion, which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, FCAR had gross assets of $12.2 billion and gross liabilities of $11.8 billion. We continue to assess structures that would maintain FCAR as an unconsolidated entity under FIN 46. We are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of FIN 46 and its impact on FCAR. In addition, Ford Credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank. FIN 46 might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs into their financial results. If this occurs, the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for Ford Credits use of these SPEs or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from Ford Credit. At December 31, 2002, about $6 billion of retail installment sale contracts Ford Credit originated were held by these SPEs. We believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these SPEs in our financial results. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on the bank sponsors of these SPEs and on the continued availability and costs of this program. We believe bank sponsors will not terminate their SPEs or reduce their purchase of receivables. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials 57 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and services. Many of these obligations are recorded; others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements. Some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event. In order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs, a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Total year years years years Debt obligations $162,222 $42,086 $56,655 $23,858 $39,623 Capital lease obligations 284 45 48 37 154 Operating lease obligations 3,294 856 1,125 603 710 Total $165,800 $42,987 $57,828 $24,498 $40,487 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Warranty and Additional Service Actions See Notes 1 and 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions. Nature of Estimates Required: The estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Pension See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities 58 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U.

The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Discount rates o Inflation o Salary growth o Expected return on plan assets o Retirement rates o Mortality rates We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our major plans in 2003 (in millions): Effect on U. S. Plans: December 31, 2002 Percentage Decline Reduction Higher Point in Funded in 2003 Assumption Change Status Equity Expense Discount rate 0.5 pts. $ 1,800 $ 1,100 $ 10 Expected return on assets 0.5 pts. 175 Other Post Retirement Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance) See Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other post retirement benefits. Nature of Estimates Required: The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other post retirement benefits (e.g., retiree health care) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments. Assumptions and Approach Used: The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: o Health care cost trends o Inflation o Discount rates o Expected return on plan assets o Salary growth o Mortality rates o Retirement rates Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated AA. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets 59 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) reflects history and asset allocation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below (assuming no changes in benefit levels); the 2003 expense effect includes the impact on service cost and interest cost as well as amortization of gains or losses (in millions): Effect on U. S. and Canadian Plans: December 31, 2002 Assumption Percentage Obligation 2003 Expense Point Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Discount rate +/ 0.5 pts. $(1,700)/$1,700 $(130)/$130 Health care cost trend +/ 1.0 pts. 3,900/(3,300) 560/(460) Allowance for Credit Losses See Note 10 of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69

The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time, and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Nature of Estimates Required: We estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models. These factors include historical credit loss trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and projected used vehicle values, and general economic measures. Assumptions and Approach Used: The factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions: o Frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time, which is measured principally by the repossession rate (the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period) o Loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. We estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models. We monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly. Sensitivity Analysis: We believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases; however, changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses. Over the past three years, repossession rates for our U.S. retail and lease portfolio have varied between 2% and 3%. 60 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in the United States (in millions): Effect on: December 31, 2002 2002 Provision Assumption Percentage Allowance for for Credit Point Credit Losses Losses Change Higher/(Lower) Higher/(Lower) Repossession rates +/ 0.1 pts. $80/$(80) $80/$(80) Loss severity +/ 1.0 pts. 25/(25) 25/(25) Changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation on Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date, reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term. Nature of Estimates Required: Each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer. At the origination of the lease, we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end. Significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict. We depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value. We monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly. We review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased, we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value (our net investment in the operating lease, equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis. Each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. In the latter case, the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us. For returned vehicles, we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value. Over the last five years, about 60% to 70% of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us. Assumptions and Approach Used: Our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions: o Auction value: the expected o Return rates: the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease. will be returned at the end of the lease. We estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models. These models use historical auction values, historical return rates for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle quality data. Sensitivity Analysis: The largest impact of changes in assumptions is on Ford Credits U.S. retail operating leases of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles. If future auction values for all of the Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles in our U.S. operating lease portfolio at year end 2002 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about $70 million in the 2003 through 2005 period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value. Similarly, if future return rates for our existing portfolio of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the U.S. were to increase by one 61 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all unvested employee awards as of January 1, 2003, and all new awards granted to employees after January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of SFAS No. 148. The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities in June 2002. This Statement requires obligations associated with disposing of operations to be recognized and measured at fair value when certain liabilities are incurred. The current accounting guidance allows for recognition of liabilities on the commitment date of a disposal or exit plan. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations. For further discussion, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires us to consolidate variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose information about variable interest entities in which we have a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. We are adopting FIN 46 as it becomes effective, which could materially impact our financial statements. For further discussion of FIN 46, see "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities" above and Note 13 of the Notes to our Financial Statements. 62 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) percentage point from our present estimates, we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $15 million in the 2003 through 2005 period. Changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in "Net investment in operating leases" and on the income statement in the "Depreciation" line of the Financial Services sector. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.

We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2003 and plant closures related to our Revitalization Plan will follow SFAS No. 146 accounting guidelines. We do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment of long lived assets to be held and used, and long lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this Statement on January 1, 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. We adopted the Statement on January 1, 2003 and do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) OUTLOOK 2003 Financial Milestones We have set and communicated certain financial milestones for 2003. The financial milestones for 2003 are as follows: Planning Assumptions Industry Volume U.S. 16.5 million units Europe 17.0 million units Net Pricing U.S. Zero Europe 1% Physicals Milestone Quality Improve in all regions Market Share Improve in all regions Automotive: Cost Performance (at constant volume and mix) Improve by at least $500 million Capital Spending $8 billion Financial Results Automotive Income Before Taxes Breakeven Operating Cash Flow* Breakeven Ford Credit Improve cash contribution to Parent Maintain managed leverage in low end of 13 14 to 1 range ** * Consistent with operating cash flow calculation under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Automotive Sector" above. ** Consistent with definition of leverage under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector" above. Based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones, we expect 2003 fully diluted earnings to be about 70 cents per share for the full year and 20 cents per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect the Automotive sector to break even and the Financial Services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company. Revitalization Plan Update In January 2002, we announced our Revitalization Plan, which is expected to improve our pre tax income to $7 billion by mid decade. Excluding unusual items, our pre tax earnings in 2002 were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the Revitalization Plan last year. We also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the Revitalization Plan. With the progress made on costs in 2002, coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year, we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well. This expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of 70 cents per share. Pension and Health Care Expenses We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans, primarily in the United States. We also provide health care coverage for our active employees, 63 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve. These quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. 68 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) The process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of Ford Credits operations in the United States and Canada, which together represented approximately 74% of its total owned finance receivables at December 31, 2002. For its international affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis," to measure re pricing mismatch. This process uses re pricing schedules, which group assets, debt, and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate swaps, effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt, to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance. As a result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives, Ford Credits debt re prices slightly faster than its assets. Other things equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid on Ford Credits debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets, thereby initially reducing Ford Credits earnings by a small amount. Correspondingly, during a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credits earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount. To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credits pre tax earnings over the following year. This sensitivity as of year end 2001 and 2002 is as follows: Pre tax earnings impact given a Pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates (in millions) interest rates (in millions) December 31, 2002 $(153) $156 December 31, 2001 $(120) $121 While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios, actual results could differ from those projected. The model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. 69 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily in the United States. Pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, under which most of our U.S. hourly employees are covered, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract. These obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to our Financial Statements and under "Critical Accounting Estimates" above. Based on present assumptions and benefit agreements, we expect our 2003 U.S. pre tax pension expense to be about $270 million, which is about $460 million higher than it was in 2002. In 2002, our health care costs for United States employees was $2.8 billion, with about $1.9 billion attributable to retirees and $900 million attributable to active employees. Our health care costs in the United States have been rising at about 16% a year over the last two years. The cost of prescription drugs, which rose about 15% in 2002 compared with 2001, is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately 30% of our total United States health care costs. Although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits, we expect these trends to continue over the next several years. Risk Factors Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: o greater price competition in the U.S. and Europe resulting from currency fluctuations, industry overcapacity or other factors; o a significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the U.S. or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo political events or other factors; o lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products; o work stoppages at key Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies; o the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs; o increased safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions; o unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise; o worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for our post retirement benefit plans (e.g., investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements); o currency or commodity price fluctuations; o a market shift from truck sales in the U.S.; o economic difficulties in South America or Asia; o reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; o labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business; o a change in our requirements under long term supply arrangements under which we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities or pay minimum amounts; o a further credit rating downgrade; o inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts; o higher than expected credit losses; o lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles; o increased price competition in the rental car industry and or a general decline in business or leisure travel due to terrorist attacks, act of war or measures taken by governments in response thereto that negatively affect the travel industry; and o our inability to implement the Revitalization Plan. 64 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives. The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Controller, and the Chief Financial Officer of Ford Credit. Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit, which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through securitization transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources. We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses. Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written polices and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the GRMC and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 17 of our Notes to Financial Statements. The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. The quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged. Beginning with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ("EaR") model from a value at risk ("VaR"). VaR is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolios liquidation value. EaR provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than VaR. The model to calculate EaR combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices. EaR includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities, investments in foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and options). Our EaR is based on transaction exposure, which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions, and our related hedging activity. At December 31, 2002, the EaR from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than $390 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $60 million higher than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities, such as non ferrous (e.g., aluminum) and precious metals (e.g., palladium, platinum and rhodium), ferrous alloys (e.g., steel), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene), which we use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge. In our hedging actions, we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options). Based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures (e.g., precious metals, aluminum, copper, natural gas, and unleaded gas), at December 31, 2002, the EaR from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than $59 million, within a 95% confidence level, which is approximately $25 million lower than the EaR projection for 2002 calculated as of December 31, 2001. The decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis. In addition to these price hedging activities, our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business. These procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts, long term supply contracts, and stockpiles. Any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the GRMC. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates. We have $25.3 billion in cash (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), which we invest in securities of various types and maturities. Many of these securities are interest sensitive. These securities are generally classified as Trading or Available for Sale. The Trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement. The Available for Sale portfolio realized 66 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our Trading and our Available for Sale portfolios. As of December 31, 2002, the value of our Trading portfolio was $18.5 billion (including assets contained in a VEBA trust), the value of our Available for Sale portfolio was $1.6 billion, and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion. Assuming a hypothetical, instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our Available for Sale and Trading portfolios would be reduced by $185 million and $27 million, respectively. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, currency and commodity risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the GRMC. Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions. We establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure, based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. Substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single A or better. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS Overview Ford Credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: o Market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results. o Credit risk the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. o Residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values. o Liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credits overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent 67 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) with these risks. Credit and residual risks are discussed above under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" and liquidity risk is discussed above under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Services Sector Ford Credit", in each case in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The following discusses Ford Credits market risks: Foreign Currency Risk. To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credits market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and consists principally of "re pricing risk" or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instruments re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it takes an instruments interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For fixed rate instruments, the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instruments principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument. For a floating rate instrument, the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on December 31st would have a re pricing period of one year on January 1st, regardless of the instruments maturity. Ford Credits receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables. Fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credits funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit often borrows longer term, with five to ten year maturities. These debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. Ford Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without derivatives, Ford Credits assets would re price more quickly than its debt. Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps. On a monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities. Ford Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating, to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques. These simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios, including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve.
