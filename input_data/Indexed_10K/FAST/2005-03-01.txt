BUSINESS Fastenal Company (Fastenal Company and, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Fastenal Company Services, Fastenal Company Purchasing, Fastenal Company Leasing, Fastenal Canada Company, Fastenal Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V., Fastenal Mexico Services S. de R.L. de C.V., Fastenal Singapore P.T.E. Ltd., Fastenal Asia Pacific, Limited., FASTCO (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd., and Fastenal Europe, B.V., collectively, the Company) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had 1,533 store sites located in 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, and the Netherlands, and 5,502 people employed at these sites. The Company sells industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion. As of December 31, 2004 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below. 2 The Company operated twelve distribution centers as of December 31, 2004 from which the Company distributes products to its store sites. Development of the Business Fastenal Company began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small, medium sized, and, in subsequent years, large cities. The Company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer its customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the Companys employees. The Company opened its first store site in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population of approximately 25,000. The following table shows the number of Company store sites at the end of each of the last ten years and the related consolidated net sales for each year during the last ten years: 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 Number of store sites at year end 1,533 1,314 1,169 1,025 897 807 764 642 483 375 Net sales (in millions) $ 1,238.5 994.9 905.4 818.3 755.6 618.2 511.2 404.2 292.3 226.5 As of December 31, 2004, the Company operated store sites in: Geographic location Number United States 1,421 Puerto Rico 8 Canada 95 Mexico 7 Singapore 1 Netherlands 1 The Company has closed only ten stores in its history; three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of the Companys product line or the expansion of the Companys distribution network improved the profitability of the locations. The Company selects new locations for its stores based on their proximity to the Companys distribution network, population statistics, and employment data for manufacturing and construction. The Company intends to continue opening new store sites and currently expects the rate of new store openings to be approximately 13 to 18% per year. The Company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its product lines. Subsequent to opening, the store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of its customer base. The Company believes, based on the demographics of the marketplace in the United States and Canada, that there is sufficient potential in those two countries to support at least 2,500 total stores. Many of the new store sites would be in cities in which the Company currently operates. The Company has not operated outside of the United States and Canada long enough to assess the market potential of those markets. 3 In addition to the stores discussed above, the Company also operates in plant sites. An in plant site is a selling unit located in or near a customers facility that sells product solely to that customer. These sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store. The Company opened the following store sites, outside the United States, in the last five years: 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Puerto Rico 1 1 1 1 Canada 16 9 7 4 11 Mexico 3 2 2 Singapore 1 Netherlands 1 During 2002, the Company began operating an in plant site in the Dominican Republic. The Company plans to open additional store sites in Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, and the Netherlands in the future. The store sites located outside the United States contributed approximately 6% of the Companys consolidated net sales in 2004. No assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved, or that new stores, once opened, will be profitable. It has been the Companys experience that near term profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites, due to the related start up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base. A new store generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. As a result of this process, sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month. Of the 49 stores opened in the first quarter of 2004, 21 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2004. For 2004, annual sales volumes of stores operating at least five years ranged between approximately $137 and $7,290, with 75% of these stores having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately $449 to $1,760. The data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of the Companys stores from 2003 to 2004 based on the age of each store. The stores opened in 2004 contributed approximately $31,500 (or approximately 2.5%) of the Companys consolidated net sales in 2004, with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2004. Age of store site as of December 31, 2004 Year opened Number of store sites in group as of December 31, 2004 Averagesales 2003 Averagesales 2004 Percent Change 01 year old 2004 219 $ $ 143 1 % 12 years old 2003 151 129 1 430 23 years old 2002 143 2 416 551 32.7 34 years old 2001 128 558 708 27.0 45 years old 2000 89 2 576 659 14.3 56 years old 1999 44 632 764 20.9 67 years old 1998 120 2 727 864 18.9 78 years old 1997 157 2 745 885 18.7 89 years old 1996 107 2 834 951 14.0 910 years old 1995 60 855 989 15.7 1011 years old 1994 62 812 917 13.0 1112 years old 1993 53 930 1,094 17.5 1216 years old 1989 1992 125 1,280 1,416 10.6 16+ years old 1967 1988 75 2,121 2,465 16.6 1 The average sales include sales of store sites open for less than the full fiscal year. 2 The company closed six stores in 2003. Each age group closed one store in 2003, except the 1997 group, which closed two stores. The 2003 average is calculated assuming the store number existed half of the year. No stores were closed during 2004. 4 As of December 31, 2004, the Company operated distribution centers in or near Winona, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Dallas, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Fresno, California; Seattle, Washington; Akron, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Winston Salem, North Carolina; Kansas City, Kansas; and Toronto, Ontario. Distribution centers are located so as to permit twice a week to five times a week deliveries to Company stores using Company trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier. As the number of stores increases, the Company intends to add new distribution centers. On August 31, 2001, the Company acquired certain assets of two subsidiaries of Textron, Inc. These assets were used in their business of selling packaged fasteners to the retail market (Do It Yourself or DIY Business). The DIY Business was purchased after a prolonged period of contraction; therefore, the historical sales and earnings were not reflective of the DIY Businesss operations at the time it was acquired by the Company. The DIY Business was subsequently sold to The Hillman Group, Inc. on October 3, 2002. The DIY Business produced net sales of $16,974 and $8,526 during the approximately nine months and four months, respectively, that it was operated by the Company in 2002 and 2001 (or approximately 1.9% and 1.0% of total net sales in each year, respectively). The Company operates a central UNIX/terminal based computer system allowing automatic data exchange between the stores and the distribution centers. The use of client/server technology allows the Companys network of UNIX based machines to serve networked personal computers and workstations. During the last six years, the Company has been converting a portion of this central processing system to a new computer software and operating system and plans to convert additional modules during 2005. At the store level, the Company operates a proprietary point of sale system. This system operates on a Microsoft Windows operating system. Trademarks The Company conducts its business in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Singapore, and the Netherlands under various trademarks and service marks, including Fastenal&reg;, EquipRite&reg;, CleanChoice&reg;, PowerPhase, and FastArc. During 2002 and 2001, the Company also operated the DIY Business under the trademarks FAS N IT and Anchor Wire. The Anchor Wire trademark was sold with the sale of the DIY Business in October 2002. Although the Company does not believe its operations are substantially dependent upon any of its trademarks or service marks, the Company considers its Fastenal name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to its business. 5 Products The Companys original product offering in 1967 was fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies, many of which are sold under the Fastenal&reg; product name. Today, the fastener product line consists of approximately 251,000 different stock items. This product line consists of two broad categories: threaded fasteners, such as bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers; and miscellaneous supplies, such as paints, various pins and machinery keys, concrete anchors, batteries, sealants, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, private label stud anchors, rivets, and related accessories. Threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects, and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures. Many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities; variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market. Therefore, the Company opens each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allows the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops. Threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 46%, 45%, and 46% of the Companys consolidated net sales in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the Fastenal&reg; product line. Most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly. Since 1993, the Company added additional product lines. These product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original Fastenal&reg; product line. The additional product lines include the following: Product line1: Yearintroduced Approximatenumber of stockitems Private label product name Tools 1993 85,000 FastTool Cutting tools 1996 70,000 SharpCut Hydraulics and pneumatics 1996 37,000 Fastenal&reg; Material handling 1996 10,000 EquipRite&reg; Janitorial supplies 1996 9,000 CleanChoice&reg; Electrical supplies 1997 13,000 PowerPhase Welding supplies2 1997 21,000 FastArc Safety supplies 1999 11,000 Fastenal&reg; Raw materials (metals) 2001 8,000 Fastenal&reg; 1 During 2002 and 2001, the Company sold product in an eleventh product line called Retail packaged product. This product line was added with the 2001 acquisition of the DIY Business. The DIY Business was sold in 2002. This product line is now included in the other product lines and represents a subset of the type of products included in our CSP conversion. 2 The Company does not sell welding gases. The Company plans to add other product lines in the future. 6 Inventory Control The Company determines its inventory stocking levels through its computer systems, its sales personnel at the store, district, and region levels, and its product managers. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of Companys stores, from individual stores, and from geographic areas; it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information. The computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary based on an established minimum maximum level. All stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers. Manufacturing and Support Services Operations In 2004 approximately 94.8% of the Companys consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards. The remaining 5.2% of the Companys consolidated net sales for 2004 related to products manufactured, modified or repaired by either the Companys Manufacturing Division or its Support Services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non standard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers specifications. The services provided by the Support Services group include, but are not limited to, items such as tool repair, band saw blade welding, third party logistics, and light manufacturing. The Company engages in these activities primarily as a service to its customers and expects these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 10% of the Companys consolidated net sales. Sources of Supply The Company uses a large number of suppliers for the approximately 515,000 standard stock items it distributes. Most items distributed by the Company can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. No single supplier accounted for more than 5% of the Companys purchases in 2004. Geographic Information Information regarding the Companys revenues and certain of the Companys assets by geographic location is set forth in note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Fastenal Companys Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference. Foreign currency fluctuations, changes in trade relations, or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact the Companys ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and the Companys foreign sales. 7 Customers and Marketing The Company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer customers in small, medium, and large sized cities a full line of products at convenient locations, and to the high quality of the Companys employees. Most of the Companys customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets. The construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations. Other users of the Companys products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. As of December 31, 2004, the Companys total number of active customer accounts (defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days) was approximately 204,000. During each of the past three years ended December 31, 2004, no one customer accounted for a significant portion of the Companys sales. The Company believes that the large number of its customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to the Company from economic downturns in a particular market. Store personnel generate a significant portion of the Companys sales through direct calls on customers. Because of the nature of the Companys business, the Company makes limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television, radio, and newspapers. Forms of advertising used by the Company include signs, catalogs, and direct mailings. Competition The Companys business is highly competitive. Competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which the Company has stores. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the Companys products are customer service and convenience. Some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses, while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales. The Company, however, believes that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products, is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area, taken together with the Companys ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers, makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products. Having trained personnel at each store also enhances the Companys ability to compete (see Employees below). Employees As of December 31, 2004, the Company employed a total of 7,946 full and part time employees, 5,502 being store managers and store employees, and the balance being employed in the Companys distribution centers, manufacturing operations, service operations, and home office. The Company believes that the quality of its employees is critical to its ability to compete successfully in the markets it currently serves and to its ability to open new stores in new markets. The Company fosters the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decision making. Wherever possible, promotions are from within the Company. For example, most new store managers are promoted from an assistant managers position at another store and district managers (who supervise a number of stores) are usually former store managers. 8 The Companys sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis, while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections. As a result, a significant portion of the Companys total employment cost varies with sales volume. The Company also pays incentive bonuses to its leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors: sales growth, profit growth, profitability, and return on assets, and to its other personnel for achieving pre determined cost containment goals. None of the Companys employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the Company has experienced no work stoppages. The Company believes its employee relations are excellent. Posting of Periodic and Current Reports Fastenal Companys annual reports on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, current reports on Form 8 K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are available free of charge on or through the Companys website at www.fastenal.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

It is anticipated that all sites for new stores will continue to be leased. It is the Companys policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular store operations if deemed desirable by management. It has been the Companys experience that space suitable for its needs and available for leasing is more than sufficient. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 4.
