ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain tabular information will not foot due to rounding. Business Overview Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We operate stores primarily located in North America. On December 31, 2008, we operated 2,311 company owned or leased store locations. Most of our customers are in the manufacturing and construction markets. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and maintenance and repair operations (MRO). The construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. Other users of our products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our customers are primarily located in North America. Financial Overview During 2008 and 2007, the weakness of the global industrial environment negatively impacted our business. During most of 2006 and all of 2005, the strength of the global industrial environment positively impacted our performance. The impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years (2008 group reflects stores opened in 1998 and earlier) and opened greater than five 19 Table of Contents years (2008 group reflects stores opened in 2003 and earlier). These two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. The stores opened greater than two years (2008 group reflects stores opened in 2006 and earlier) represent a consistent same store view of our business. The net sales growth rate for each of the groups was as follows: Store Age 2008 2007 2006 Opened greater than 10 years 6.9 % 4.4 % 8.0 % Opened greater than 5 years 7.8 % 6.1 % 9.7 % Opened greater than 2 years 9.6 % 7.3 % 12.2 % Net Sales Net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 2,340,425 $ 2,061,819 $ 1,809,337 Percentage change 13.5 % 14.0 % 18.8 % The 2008, 2007, and 2006 net sales growth rate percentages reflect a weakening economy since late 2006 versus a strengthening economy from summer 2003 to late 2006 in the North American market. The increase in net sales in 2008, 2007, and 2006 came primarily from unit sales growth in existing stores opened more than two years, growth in our newer product lines, and new store openings. Stores opened in 2008 contributed approximately $31,917 (or 1.4%) to 2008 net sales. Stores opened in 2007 contributed approximately $87,374 (or 3.7%) to 2008 net sales and approximately $35,267 (or 1.7%) to 2007 net sales. The rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years, and, as stated earlier, the sales of older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores. Monthly Daily Sales Growth Our business had daily sales growth rates (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year) as follows: Month 2008 2007 2006 January 15.6 % 12.6 % 23.9 % February 15.0 % 11.8 % 21.3 % March 16.9 % 15.5 % 21.1 % April 17.1 % 12.0 % 19.1 % May 16.0 % 13.2 % 19.2 % June 15.9 % 14.8 % 20.6 % July 14.8 % 13.9 % 19.7 % August 16.4 % 13.4 % 20.7 % September 14.3 % 13.7 % 16.1 % October 11.9 % 14.7 % 15.9 % November 6.8 % 15.2 % 16.3 % December 0.0 % 16.8 % 17.7 % Note: Daily sales are defined as the sales for a period divided by the number of business days in a period. The strong growth in 2006 generally represents a continuation of the strong environments experienced in 2004 and 2005. The growth in 2007 generally represents a weakening environment which began in late 2006. The final three months of 2007 continued in the same variable fashion as the previous nine months but showed consistent 20 Table of Contents improvement from the third quarter daily sales growth rate of 13.7%. Generally speaking, this improvement in late 2007 remained in the first nine months of 2008 and weakened in the October to December time frame. The third and fourth quarters of 2008 were influenced by variations in the number of business days versus 2007. This was most pronounced in September 2008 which had 21 business days versus 19 in September 2007. This had a dampening effect on September 2008s daily average sales growth as some of our customers purchases are based more on monthly budgets rather than daily consumption. The slow down in the final three months of the year resulted from the general economic weakness in the global marketplace. We believe the improvement in the final months of 2007, and the first nine months of 2008, and our performance in the final months of 2008 relative to the marketplace in which we operate, were driven, in part, by our pathway to profit initiative described later. Sales by Product Line The following table indicates, by product line, the year of introduction and the percentage of net sales. Type Introduced 2008 2007 2006 Fasteners1 1967 51.2 % 50.7 % 51.5 % Tools 1993 9.9 % 10.6 % 10.9 % Cutting tools 1996 4.5 % 4.6 % 4.8 % Hydraulics & pneumatics 1996 6.6 % 6.5 % 6.2 % Material handling 1996 5.9 % 6.1 % 6.3 % Janitorial supplies 1996 5.4 % 5.4 % 5.3 % Electrical supplies 1997 4.2 % 4.1 % 3.7 % Welding supplies 1997 3.6 % 3.6 % 3.5 % Safety supplies 1999 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.4 % Metals 2001 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.6 % Direct ship2 2004 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.6 % Other 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 1 Fastener product line represents fasteners and miscellaneous supplies. Threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90% of the fastener product line sales in 2008, 2007, and 2006 and approximately 46% of consolidated net sales in 2008, 2007, and 2006. 2 Direct ship represents a cross section of products from the ten product lines. The items included here represent certain items with historically low margins which are shipped direct from our suppliers to our customers. Impact of Fuel Prices Rising fuel prices negatively impacted 2008 and 2007; however, we did feel some relief in the final months of 2008. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2008, our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately $2.9 million, $3.7 million, $3.7 million, and $2.4 million per month, respectively. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2007, total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately $2.1 million, $2.5 million, $2.4 million, and $2.7 million per month, respectively. The changes resulted from variations in fuel costs, the freight initiative discussed below, increases in product sales, and the increase in the number of vehicles necessary to support additional sales personnel and to support additional store locations. These fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles (semi tractors, straight trucks, and sprinter trucks) which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses (the split in the last several years has been approximately 50:50 between distribution and store use). In 2005, we introduced our new freight model as a means to continue to improve our operating performance. The freight model represents a focused effort to haul a higher percentage of our products utilizing the Fastenal trucking network (which operates at a substantial savings to external service providers because of our ability to leverage our existing routes) and to charge freight more consistently in our various operating units. 21 Table of Contents This initiative positively impacted the latter two thirds of 2005, all of 2006, all of 2007, and all of 2008 despite the changes in average per gallon fuel costs shown in the following table: 2008 Quarter 2007 Quarter 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Diesel fuel $ 3.47 $ 4.30 $ 4.38 $ 3.11 $ 2.59 $ 2.85 $ 2.94 $ 3.25 Gasoline $ 3.07 $ 3.65 $ 3.85 $ 2.49 $ 2.31 $ 2.96 $ 2.86 $ 2.92 The average price of a gallon of diesel fuel and a gallon of gasoline decreased by 4.3% and 14.7%, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008. Given the nature of our distribution business, fluctuations in fuel prices can have a meaningful impact on our results. This impact is also covered later in our discussion about gross margin and operating and administrative expenses. Gross Profit Margins Gross profit as a percent of net sales was as follows: 2008 52.8 % 2007 50.8 % 2006 50.2 % Gross profit margins for 2008 increased over 2007 and 2006. The improvement was driven by several factors: (1) a focused effort to challenge our sales force to increase the gross margin on business with a lower than acceptable margin, (2) a focused effort to stay ahead of inflationary increases in product cost, (3) improvements in our direct sourcing operations, (4) continued focus on our freight initiative (discussed earlier), and (5) continued focus on our product availability. This product availability focus centers on our master stocking hubs in Indianapolis, Indiana and Modesto, California, and our efficient ability to move product from store to store. Due to the benefit of item (4) above, the rising fuel costs discussed earlier had only a nominal negative impact on our gross margin early in the first quarter of 2008 and this reversed to a positive gross margin impact from late in the first quarter into the second, third, and fourth quarters. Gross profit margins for 2007 increased over 2006. The improvement was driven by our freight initiative (discussed earlier) and by improvements in our direct sourcing operations. These improvements were partially offset by the rising diesel fuel cost (discussed earlier). Operating and Administrative Expenses Operating and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were as follows: 2008 33.6 % 2007 32.6 % 2006 32.5 % Operating and administrative expenses in 2008 grew 17.0% over 2007. While this rate of growth was greater than our sales growth of 13.5%, it represents the slowest rate of growth we have achieved in recent history. The growth was primarily driven by (1) payroll and related costs, which expanded due to headcount growth and increased incentive due to our gross margin improvement; (2) transportation costs, which expanded due to rising fuel costs; and (3) our legal settlement described earlier in this Form 10 K. As the economy dramatically weakened in October 2008, we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth in subsequent quarters if our sales growth were to continue to weaken. We were pleased with our ability to reign in expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 given the increase in personnel and store locations compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 grew 11.0% over the fourth quarter of 2007. 22 Table of Contents Operating and administrative expenses grew at a rate faster than the net sales growth rate in 2007. This growth was primarily due to increases in occupancy and transportation expenses, our stock option expense, and, to a lesser extent, the initiatives (most notably the CSP2 conversions) mentioned elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The operating and administrative expenses for 2008 include $3,247 of additional compensation expense related to the adoption of new stock option accounting rules in early 2007. During 2007, this expense was $1,915. We granted options to purchase 2,200,000 shares in 2007 and an additional 275,000 shares in April 2008. These options vest over a five to eight year period. The two option grants, when combined, will result in compensation expense of approximately $300 per month for the next four years, and dropping slightly in the remaining period. No other stock options were outstanding during 2008 or 2007. Operating and administrative expenses grew at a rate faster than the net sales growth rate in 2006. This was primarily due to (1) the initiatives (most notably the CSP2 conversions) mentioned elsewhere in this Form 10 K and their impact on employee numbers throughout the organization during 2006, (2) the impact of rising fuel costs for the first eight months of the year, and (3) increases in occupancy costs. In addition, the loss of a business day for the year, which occurred in the third quarter, negatively impacted our ability to leverage operating and administrative expenses. Payroll & Related Costs Payroll and related costs represented approximately 65%, 67%, and 67% of operating and administrative expenses in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Our net payroll cost for 2008 increased approximately 14.1% over 2007. Our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased approximately 7.2% over the fourth quarter of 2007. The disparity between the 9.2% full time equivalent headcount growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 7.2% expense growth is driven by contractions in the incentive commissions and bonuses earned during the final quarter of 2008. Our sales personnel (including our branch managers, district managers, and regional leaders) are rewarded for growth in sales, gross profit dollars, and pre tax earnings. The contraction in the growth rates of these amounts during the fourth quarter, when compared to the growth rates in previous quarters of 2008, drove the contraction in the growth of incentive commissions and bonuses. In 2008, payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales due to increased incentive plan payouts resulting primarily from increased gross profit dollars for the year. In 2007, payroll and related costs increased at a rate which was less than the rate of increase in net sales. In 2006, payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales growth primarily due to the impact of the additional employees from our CSP2 conversions, and from our master hub initiative. Effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively. This tight management was significant, given our store expansion discussed elsewhere and given our acceleration in the addition of outside sales personnel at existing stores discussed elsewhere. The following sets forth the average number of employees (numbers are presented on a full time equivalent basis) for each of 2008, 2007, and 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Store personnel 8,142 6,808 5,951 Distribution and manufacturing personnel 2,158 1,992 1,839 Administrative and sales support personnel 1,406 1,363 1,261 Total 11,706 10,163 9,051 % Change 15.2 % 12.3 % 15.0 % The rate of increase in store personnel in 2008 was faster than the sales growth rate due to the additional personnel added as part of our pathway to profit initiative discussed elsewhere. The rate of increase in distribution and manufacturing and administrative and sales support personnel in 2008 and 2007 was slower than the sales growth rate due to the tight management of headcount growth since early 2007 when we first introduced our pathway to profit initiative discussed elsewhere in this report. 23 Table of Contents We were pleased with our organizations ability to manage payroll and related costs in 2008, 2007, and 2006, while also contributing an annual profit sharing amount of approximately $5,207, $4,743, and $3,153, respectively, to our employees 401(k) plan accounts or Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) in the case of our Canadian employees. Occupancy Costs Occupancy costs represented approximately 17.3%, 18.4%, and 17.3% of operating expenses in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2008, we were able to leverage our occupancy costs for the first time since earlier in the decade. Occupancy expenses grew approximately 9.9% from 2007 to 2008 and 21.1% from 2006 to 2007. This improving trend was driven by the completion of our standard stocking model (formerly referred to as CSP) store conversion during 2006 and due to the decrease in the rate of store openings pursuant to our pathway to profit initiative. Occupancy costs in 2008, 2007, and 2006 increased due to: (1) a 7.5%, 8.1%, and 14.0% increase in the number of store locations in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, (2) the upgrade of store locations in connection with the store upgrade initiative (formerly referred to as CSP), and (3) the relocation of existing stores. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we relocated approximately 5%, 8%, and 12% of our stores, respectively. Transportation Costs Transportation costs represented approximately 5.4%, 5.0%, and 5.0% of operating expenses in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. One component of operating and administrative expenses that experienced meaningful de leverage in 2008 was transportation cost. Our transportation costs grew approximately 26.7% from 2007 to 2008 and 14.4% from 2006 to 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in fuel costs discussed earlier and by the increase in the number of vehicles needed to support an expanded sales force. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Property, Plant, and Equipment The loss on sale of property and equipment for 2008 and 2006 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles. The 2008 number was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our Dallas, Texas distribution center. Net Earnings Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), growth rates in net earnings, and growth rates in EPS, were as follows: Dollar amounts 2008 2007 2006 Net earnings $ 279,705 232,622 199,038 Basic EPS $ 1.88 1.55 1.32 Diluted EPS $ 1.88 1.55 1.32 Percentage change 2008 2007 2006 Net earnings 20.2 % 16.9 % 19.3 % Basic EPS 21.3 % 17.4 % 20.0 % Diluted EPS 21.3 % 17.4 % 20.0 % During 2008 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses. During 2007 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned impact of payroll and related costs and the improvements in gross profit margins. During 2006 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the impact of the improvements in gross profit margins. The EPS growth rate was greater than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in all three years. 24 Table of Contents Working Capital Two components of working capital, accounts receivable and inventories, are highlighted below. The annual dollar increase and the annual rate of growth were as follows: Dollar growth 2008 2007 Accounts receivable $ 8,609 $ 26,799 Inventories $ 59,655 $ 48,595 Annual growth rate 2008 2007 Accounts receivable 3.6 % 12.8 % Inventories 11.8 % 10.7 % These two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital. These initiatives include (1) the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management (this facility became operational early in 2005) and (2) the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory, new expanded inventory, inventory necessary for upcoming store openings, or inventory necessary for our master stocking hubs. The accounts receivable increase of 3.6% from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 resulted from daily sales growth of 6.8% and 0.0% in November and December, respectively. The inventory increase from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 of 11.8% was less than our annual sales growth of 13.5%; however, it was higher than we expected. A portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends; therefore, the drop in sales growth activity during the last two to three months of the year resulted in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product. We reduced our ordering patterns on products with a longer lead time midway through the quarter to match current sales trends. As we indicated in earlier communications, our short term goals center on our ability to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory (Annual Sales: AR&I) to better than a 3.0:1 ratio (on December 31, 2008 and 2007 we had a ratio of 2.9:1 and 2.8:1, respectively). Pathway to Profit During April 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business. For most of the last decade, we have used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business (opening approximately 14.0% new stores each year). Under our pathway to profit initiative, we are adding outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns. We intend to fund this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7.0% to 10.0% per year (we opened approximately 7.5%, 8.1%, and 14.0% new stores in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively). Our goal is four fold: (1) to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model, (2) to grow the sales of our average store from $80 thousand per month (Spring 2007) to $125 thousand per month (five years or 2012), (3) to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow, and (4) to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital (primarily inventory) as our average store size increases. 25 Table of Contents In implementing the pathway to profit, we have increased our year over year store count and full time equivalent (FTE) head count at the end of each of the respective periods as follows: December2008 September2008 June2008 March2008 December2007 Store count growth 7.5 % 7.2 % 7.1 % 6.8 % 8.1 % Store personnel FTE 12.2 % 14.4 % 17.5 % 18.3 % 18.0 % Distribution and manufacturing personnel FTE 1.5 % 4.6 % 9.1 % 8.8 % 9.4 % Administrative and sales support personnel FTE 4.6 % 3.1 % (3.0 )% (3.4 )% 2.3 % Total FTE headcount growth 9.2 % 11.0 % 13.0 % 13.3 % 14.0 % Store Size and Profitability1 The store groups listed in the table below, excluding our strategic account stores, represented approximately 88% and 90% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Strategic account stores, which numbered 20 and 14 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market. Our remaining sales (approximately 12%) related to either: (1) our strategic account stores, (2) our in plant locations, (3) our direct Fastenal Cold Heading business, or (4) our direct import business. Our average store, excluding the business not sold through a store, had sales of $72,500 per month in the fourth quarter of 2007. This average was $70,200 per month in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average age, number of stores and pre tax margin data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, were as follows: Three months ended December 31, 2008 Sales per Month AverageAge(Years) Number ofStores Percentageof Stores Pre TaxMarginPercentage $0 to $30,000 2.7 498 21.6 % (23.9 )% $30,001 to $60,000 5.3 797 34.4 % 9.9 % $60,001 to $100,000 8.0 539 23.3 % 20.9 % $100,001 to $150,000 10.2 286 12.4 % 25.9 % Over $150,000 14.1 171 7.4 % 27.4 % Strategic Accounts 20 0.9 % Total 2,311 100.0 % Three months ended December 31, 2007 Sales per Month AverageAge(Years) Number ofStores Percentageof Stores Pre TaxMarginPercentage $0 to $30,000 2.3 428 19.8 % (20.6 )% $30,001 to $60,000 4.6 712 33.0 % 9.2 % $60,001 to $100,000 7.3 520 24.1 % 20.3 % $100,001 to $150,000 9.0 314 14.5 % 23.7 % Over $150,000 12.9 172 8.0 % 25.3 % Strategic Accounts 14 0.6 % Total 2,160 100.0 % As we indicated in April 2007, our goal during the five year period from 2007 to 2012 is to increase the sales of our average store to approximately $125,000 per month by 2012. This will shift the store mix emphasis from the first three categories ($0 to $30,000, $30,001 to $60,000, and $60,001 to $100,000) to the last three categories ($60,001 to 100,000, $100,001 to $150,000, and over $150,000), and we believe this will allow us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity. 26 Table of Contents 1 Note Dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars, not thousands. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: Dollars % of NetEarnings 2008 $ 259,898 92.9 % 2007 $ 227,895 98.0 % 2006 $ 97,875 49.2 % The 2008 and 2007 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above. The percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on December 31: 2008 2007 2006 Store 62 % 63 % 62 % Distribution Center 38 % 37 % 38 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % New stores open with the standard store model, which consists of a core stocking level of approximately $62 thousand per location. This inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: Dollars % of NetEarnings 2008 $ 86,583 31.0 % 2007 $ 37,674 16.2 % 2006 $ 74,199 37.3 % Property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: Dollars % of NetEarnings 2008 $ 95,306 34.1 % 2007 $ 55,749 24.0 % 2006 $ 77,581 39.0 % The 2008 increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures. This was primarily due to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center, the purchase of adjoining property in Indianapolis, Indiana and the relocation of our Dallas, Texas distribution center. The 2007 decrease in investing activities is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures and the impact of approximately $12,400 due to sales of marketable securities in 2007. The 2006 amount was also impacted by the purchase of a building and the equipment for our new distribution center in Modesto, California. 27 Table of Contents Property and equipment expenditures in 2008, 2007 and 2006 consist of: (1) the purchase of software and hardware for Fastenals information processing systems, (2) the addition of certain pickup trucks, (3) the purchase of signage, shelving, and other fixed assets related to store openings, (4) the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment, (5) the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties, (6) the expansion of Fastenals distribution/trucking fleet, (7) the cost related to the relocation of our new Dallas, Texas distribution center (2007 and 2008), (8) the cost related to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center, (9) the cost of new manufacturing facility in Rockford, Illinois, and (10) the cost of our new master distribution center in Modesto, California (2006). Disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick up trucks, semi tractors, and trailers in the normal course of business, the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and, in the case of 2008, the disposal of our former Dallas, Texas distribution center. We expect to incur approximately $65,000 in total capital expenditures in 2009, consisting of approximately $34,000 for manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment and facilities, $3,000 for shelving and related supplies for our store openings and a la carte store expansions, $12,000 for data processing equipment, $7,000 for store buildings and improvement to store buildings, and $9,000 for vehicles. We have expanded the number of owned store locations over the last several years and expect to purchase additional locations in the future. As of December 31, 2008, we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures. We anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations, from available cash and cash equivalents, and, to a lesser degree, from our borrowing capacity. In addition to opening new stores in the United States, we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets. We have future commitments for leased facilities and for leased vehicles at December 31, 2008.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006 we purchased 590,000 shares, 2,086,000 shares, and 474,000 shares, respectively, of our outstanding stock. The average price per share paid was approximately $43.99, $41.86, and $36.49 per share, respectively. With the new authorization in 2008, we have remaining authority to purchase up to approximately 1,410,000 additional shares of our common stock. Dividends We declared a semi annual dividend of $.35 per share on January 19, 2009. We paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $.79, $.44, and $.40 in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Line of Credit We have a $40,000 line of credit under which $0 was outstanding at December 31, 2008. The line bears interest at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. Effects of Inflation Price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Critical Accounting Policies Our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments. Allowance for doubtful accounts This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs. The analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable, the financial condition of a customer or industry, and general economic conditions. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers. Inventory reserve This reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage. The reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends. The analysis includes inventory levels, sales information, physical inventory counts, cycle count adjustments, and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results. Health insurance reserve This reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results. General insurance reserve This reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation, property and casualty losses, and other self insured losses. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results. Tax Strategies Our effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. These reserves are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN No. 48). Under this Interpretation, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions and FIN No. 48 tax liabilities. We 29 Table of Contents reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit, when (i) there is a completion of a tax audit, (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods. Geographic Information Information regarding our revenues and long lived assets by geographic area is set forth in note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this Form 10 K under the heading Certain Risks and Uncertainties and Item 1A. Risk Factors. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows: (1) Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. (2) Commodity Steel Pricing We buy and sell various types of steel products which consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners. During the last decade, there has been nominal movement in overall product pricing, with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the Far East markets that occurred in the late 1990s. This trend reversed to inflation in late 2003 and early 2004 as well as the later part of 2007 and all of 2008. Fluctuations in pricing of certain commodities like steel can affect our cost structure and pricing. We are exposed to the impact of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers. (3) Commodity Fuel Prices We have market risk for changes in gasoline and diesel fuel; however, this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight cost to our customers and the efficiency of our trucking distribution network. 30 Table of Contents
