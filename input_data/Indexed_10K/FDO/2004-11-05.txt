ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the fiscal years ended August 28, 2004 and August 30, 2003. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Net Sales Net sales increased approximately 11.2% ($531.7 million) in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003, and approximately 14.1% ($587.5 million) in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. The increases in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were attributable to increased sales in existing stores (stores open more than 13 months) and sales from new stores opened as part of the Companys store expansion program. Sales in existing stores increased approximately 1.9% as compared with fiscal 2003. Sales of household chemicals, paper products, food, and health and beauty aids, the primary components of hardlines consumable merchandise, increased in the mid single digits. In a difficult economic environment for the Companys low and low middle income customer base, sales in existing stores of hanging apparel and shoes, domestics, giftware and seasonal goods, which are more discretionary purchase categories, were less than in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, the customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in existing stores, increased approximately 0.7%, and the average transaction increased approximately 0.9% to $8.95. Increased sales of hardlines merchandise have been the primary contributor to the overall sales increases, with hardlines sales increases in existing stores of approximately 3.2% in fiscal 2004. Hardlines as a percentage of total sales increased to approximately 77.7% in fiscal 2004 compared to approximately 76.7% in fiscal 2003. Softlines as a percentage of sales decreased to approximately 22.3% in fiscal 2004 (with hanging apparel and shoes representing about 11.8%, basic apparel 4.1% and domestics 6.4%) compared to approximately 23.3% in fiscal 2003 (with hanging apparel and shoes representing about 12.4%, basic apparel 4.4% and domestics 6.5%). Softline sales which are primarily discretionary, decreased approximately 2.5% in existing stores in fiscal 2004. The Company distributed one advertising circular in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Sales in existing stores increased approximately 3.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared with fiscal 2002. Sales of hardlines consumable merchandise again were stronger than sales of more discretionary merchandise. In fiscal 2003 the customer count increased approximately 1.9% and the average transaction increased approximately 1.6% to $8.87. Existing store hardlines sales increased approximately 4.3% and softlines sales increased approximately 2.1%. The Company distributed one advertising circular in fiscal 2003 and two advertising circulars in fiscal 2002. Hardlines merchandise includes primarily household chemical and paper products, health and beauty aids, candy, snack and other food, electronics, housewares and giftware, toys, school supplies, hardware and automotive supplies. Softlines merchandise includes mens, womens, boys, girls and infants clothing and accessories, shoes, and domestic items such as blankets, sheets and towels. During fiscal 2004 the Company completed the strategic assessment, concept testing and development of implementation plans for additional investments in its urban initiative and a cooler program for perishable food. The urban initiative in fiscal 2005 includes investments in process changes, technology and people to improve the operating performance, including sales, of more than 1,000 stores in thirty large metropolitan markets. Approximately 250 stores are expected to be impacted in the first quarter. Under the cooler program, beginning in January 2005 coolers are expected to be installed in selected stores. By the end of the fiscal year on August 27, 2005, the Company plans to have coolers installed in approximately 500 stores. The Company also plans to begin implementation by fiscal year end of new point of sale software to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in stores with coolers, simplify cashier training and speed up checkout processes. These programs, together with the introduction of additional opportunistically purchased goods available throughout the year, with particular emphasis on the holiday season, and the addition of one advertising circular in November 2004, should contribute to an increase in sales in existing stores in fiscal 2005. The Company currently expects that sales in existing stores will accelerate from the 0.7% increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to increases in the 3% to 5% range by the end of fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 500 stores and closed 61 stores for a net addition of 439 stores, compared with the opening of 475 stores and closing of 64 stores for a net addition of 411 stores during fiscal 2003. Of these new store openings 79 of the properties are owned by the Company, and the balance of the properties are leased. The Companys focus on urban markets has contributed to the strong sales performance of new stores, but the lead times continue to be less predictable and longer for opening urban stores verses non urban stores, including longer time for the permitting process and the completion of leasehold improvements and new construction. The sales performance of new stores (stores open 13 months or less) was equal to approximately 96% of the chain 18 average sales per store in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. The Company also expanded or relocated 79 stores in fiscal 2004, compared with 103 stores that were expanded or relocated in fiscal 2003. In addition, approximately 116 stores in fiscal 2004 and 42 stores in fiscal 2003 were renovated. The Company currently plans to open approximately 500 to 560 stores and close approximately 60 to 70 stores in fiscal 2005 resulting in approximately 8% to 9% net new store growth and 9% to 10% net square footage growth. To achieve this target, the Company has retained real estate brokers in certain major metropolitan areas and also has added personnel to its Real Estate Department. Urban markets will continue to be the focus with approximately 60% to 65% of the new stores expected to open in urban areas. The Company also currently expects to renovate an additional 110 stores and expand or relocate approximately 45 stores in fiscal 2005. Store opening, closing, expansion, relocation and renovation plans are continuously reviewed and are subject to change. Cost of Sales and Margin Cost of sales increased approximately 11.1% ($350.5 million) in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003, and approximately 13.7% ($379.1 million) in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. These increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume in each of the years. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 66.2% in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and 66.5% in fiscal 2002. The percentage was favorably impacted in fiscal 2004 by approximately 0.1% of sales due to a change in the treatment of certain vendor allowances in conformity with a recent accounting pronouncement. This change will not impact the comparability of future years. Lower merchandise markdowns also favorably impacted the percentage in fiscal 2004. A slight increase in markdowns in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was more than offset by lower markdowns in the remaining quarters. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage in fiscal 2004 due to this accounting change and lower markdowns was offset by a shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin basic consumables and relatively less sales of higher margin discretionary merchandise. The cost of sales percentage in fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by increased shrinkage and increased freight costs due to higher fuel expense. The Company is addressing the issue of shrinkage by implementing new loss prevention reports that provide more visibility to store level issues and by adding personnel to its Loss Prevention Department. In addition, as part of its urban initiative, the Company is modifying its field management structure to increase management presence and the frequency of inspections in its urban markets. The opening of the eighth distribution center in January 2005 will reduce the average distance between the stores and a distribution center and that reduction is expected to offset, to some degree, the higher fuel costs. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage for fiscal 2003 was due primarily to improved initial margins, the favorable impact of supply chain initiatives, including the opening of the seventh full service distribution center, and the implementation of a transportation management system. For fiscal 2005, the Companys plan is for the cost of sales percentage to increase as compared to the percentage in fiscal 2004 due to the continuing effect of the shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin basic consumables, rising fuel costs and increased shrinkage. These impacts should be most pronounced during the first half of the fiscal year and the shrink initiatives and new distribution center are expected to mitigate these impacts during the second half of the fiscal year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 12.9% ($156.7 million) in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003, and approximately 15.2% ($160.4 million) in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. The increases in these expenses primarily were attributable to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation and the continued ramp up of the seventh distribution center. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.0% in fiscal 2004, 25.6% in fiscal 2003 and 25.3% in fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2004 was due primarily to below plan sales which negatively impacted the Companys ability to leverage its cost structure. In addition, the effect of the change in treatment of certain vendor allowances mentioned previously (approximately 0.1% of sales) negatively impacted expense leverage. This change will not impact the comparability of future years. Continued increases in insurance costs, primarily workers compensation (approximately 0.1% of sales), and increased rent (approximately 0.1% of sales) also adversely impacted expense leverage. The workers compensation cost increase is due in large part to the continued growth in the number of associates and to an increase in the average claim amount primarily due to medical cost increases. While the Company is aggressively working to reduce the frequency and severity of claims through corporate preventative initiatives, those costs are expected to continue to increase faster than sales in the near term. The rent increase related in part to the Companys opening of more build to suit and other new store construction. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expense percentage of sales for fiscal 2004 was offset slightly by a reduction in bonus costs (approximately 0.1% of sales) as the Company did not reach the earnings target necessary for payment of full bonuses. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expense percentage of sales for fiscal 2003 was due primarily to increased insurance costs (primarily workers compensation) and legal related costs. In addition, the loss of planned sales due to opening of a lesser number of new stores than originally planned also adversely impacted expense leverage. This was offset slightly by the elimination of an advertising circular distributed in fiscal 2002. For fiscal 2005, the Companys plan is for the selling, general and administrative expense percentage to sales to increase as compared to the percentage in fiscal 2004. The Company expects the funding of its various growth initiatives as previously mentioned to negatively impact its expense leverage for the year by approximately 0.4% of sales. In addition, increases in insurance and rent may also negatively impact expense leverage depending, in part, on the sales benefit of new programs. 19 Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 36.6% in fiscal 2004, and 36.5% in both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. For fiscal 2005, the Companys plan is for the effective tax rate to increase slightly compared to the rate in fiscal 2004 due to the effect of changes in state income taxes. Based on the above plans for sales, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and tax rate, the Companys current plan is for net income per diluted share of Common Stock in fiscal 2005 to increase in the 4% to 6% range. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2004 was $375.9 million as compared to $301.8 million in fiscal 2003 and $412.7 million in fiscal 2002. These amounts have enabled the Company to fund its regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend payments and any repurchase of the Companys Common Stock. In addition, the Company maintains $200 million of unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks for short term financing of seasonal cash needs. One hundred million dollars of the facilities expires on May 26, 2005 and the remaining $100 million expires on May 31, 2009. The Company had no borrowings against these facilities during fiscal 2004. There were no long term borrowings during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002. Merchandise inventories at August 28, 2004 increased 14.7% over the level at August 30, 2003. This increase was due to additional inventory for 439 net new stores and the accelerated flow of seasonal merchandise as part of the program to improve store level presentations and sales during the holiday period by smoothing the workflow in the stores and distribution network. As a result of conservative planning and the curtailment of some planned purchases, out of season apparel inventories were approximately 8% lower on a per store basis than at the end of fiscal 2003. With a more aggressive holiday seasonal sales plan this year, the Company expects inventories per store to continue at higher year over year levels through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005, but the plan is for inventories to return to more normal levels by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The slight decrease in capital expenditures to $218.1 million in fiscal 2004 from $219.8 million in fiscal 2003 primarily was due to the fact that substantially more expenditures were incurred in fiscal 2003 to complete construction of the seventh distribution center than were incurred in fiscal 2004 to begin construction of the eighth distribution center. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 are expected to be approximately $270 million, which primarily represent estimated expenditures for new store expansion, including construction of an increased number of stores, existing store expansion, relocation, and renovation, the completion of construction of the eighth distribution center and start of construction of the ninth distribution center, expenditures related to store focused technology infrastructure and the implementation of a cooler program for perishable goods in selected stores. The new store expansion and eighth distribution center will also require additional investment in merchandise inventories. Capital spending plans, including store expansion, are continuously reviewed and are subject to change. Cash flow from current operations is expected to be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and capital resource needs, including store expansion and other capital spending programs and any repurchase of the Companys Common Stock. In addition, the Company has available revolving credit facilities as discussed above. On October 9, 2002, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 5 million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time as market conditions warrant. During the year ended August 30, 2003, the Company purchased in the open market, 2.2 million shares at a cost of $65.9 million. On April 22, 2004, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional 5 million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time as market conditions warrant. During the year ended August 28, 2004, the Company purchased 5.6 million shares at a cost of $176.7 million, leaving 2.2 million shares authorized to be purchased. The following table shows the Companys obligations and commitments as of August 28, 2004, to make future payments under contractual obligations (In thousands): Payments Due During One Year Fiscal Period Ending Contractual Obligations Total August 2005 August 2006 August 2007 August 2008 August 2009 Thereafter Merchandise letters of credit $ 91,360 $ 91,360 $ $ $ $ $ Operating leases 967,536 221,468 196,109 162,856 125,851 88,680 172,572 Construction obligations 41,326 41,326 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 1,100,222 $ 354,154 $ 196,109 $ 162,856 $ 125,851 $ 88,680 $ 172,572 Most of the Companys operating leases provide the Company with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. The following table shows the Companys other commercial commitments as of August 28, 2004 (In thousands): Other Commercial Commitments Total Amounts Committed Standby letters of credit $ 70,000 Surety bonds 6,167 Total Commercial Commitments $ 76,167 20 At August 28, 2004, approximately $55.6 million of the merchandise letters of credit are included in accounts payable on the Companys balance sheet. A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit and surety bonds (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) are used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to the Companys workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. The Company accrues for these liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion. Recent Accounting Pronouncements No new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year have had or are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies Management believes the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Merchandise Inventories: Inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less markon percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. The Company records adjustment to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, management makes estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, additional markdowns may be necessary. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal goods. The Company also provides for estimated inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory for the period from the physical inventory to the financial statement date. These estimates are based on historical experience and other factors. Property and Equipment: Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is being provided principally by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The Company generally assigns no salvage value to property and equipment. Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, impairment losses on fixed assets have not been material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Insurance Liabilities: The Company is primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation and general liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of the Companys retail locations and employees. The Companys self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. Management reviews current and historical claims data in developing its estimates. The Company also uses information provided by outside actuaries with respect to workers compensation and general liability claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then the Company may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to the reported financial condition and results of operations.
