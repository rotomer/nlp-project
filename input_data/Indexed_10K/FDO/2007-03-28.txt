ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company operates a chain of more than 6,200 general merchandise retail discount stores in 44 states, providing primarily low to lower middle income consumers with a wide range of competitively priced basic merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. This discussion should also be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in the General Information section of this Report and the Risk Factors listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. 15 Fiscal 2006 Overview For fiscal 2006, the Companys sales were $6.4 billion, an increase of $570.0 million from fiscal 2005. Net income declined $22.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 and diluted net income per common share declined $0.04 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Included in the results for fiscal 2006 are: (i) a litigation charge of $45.0 million (approximately $0.18 per diluted share) associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information) and; (ii) cumulative charges of $10.5 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share) to record non cash stock based compensation and related interest expense (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information). The various components affecting the Companys results for fiscal 2006 are discussed in more detail in Results of Operations below. During fiscal 2006, the Company continued to focus its efforts on four key initiatives designed to increase sales and profitability: the installation of refrigerated coolers in selected stores; the continued development of a Treasure Hunt merchandise program; the continuation of an aggressive store opening program; and the Urban Initiative. These initiatives are discussed in detail below. Coolers To drive incremental traffic and to increase the average transaction value, the Company is enhancing its food assortment to meet customers frequent fill in food needs. During fiscal 2006, the Company installed refrigerated coolers in approximately 2,800 stores. The customer traffic generated by coolers has increased sales of food and other merchandise throughout the store. At the end of fiscal 2006, approximately 3,800 stores had refrigerated coolers. Treasure Hunt merchandise program The Company has continued to supplement its basic assortment of merchandise with the purchase of certain items designed to create more excitement in stores throughout the year, with particular emphasis on holidays, spring and back to school seasons, and to balance gross margin pressure from increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. During fiscal 2006, the Company took a more process oriented approach to this initiative by focusing on three key components: identifying and selecting exciting values for customers; informing customers of the compelling values through circulars and in store handouts and signage; and effectively displaying the items in stores to attract customer attention. New Stores During fiscal 2006, the Company opened 350 stores and closed 75 stores while continuing to improve its site selection and development processes. Urban Initiative The Urban Initiative is designed to improve the operating performance of high sales volume stores in large metropolitan markets through investments in people, process changes and technology, including organizational changes to support a more mobile and flexible workforce. During fiscal 2006, the Company continued its investments in the Urban Initiative markets (approximately 1,400 stores at the end of fiscal 2006) and experienced an improvement in profitability in most markets, resulting from positive trends in comparable store sales, better expense control and improvements in inventory shrinkage and store manager retention. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma struck the U.S. Gulf Coast and Florida, impacting numerous stores in the afflicted areas. Because the Companys stores are widely dispersed, lost sales due to closed stores resulting from damage or power outages were generally limited and were substantially offset by increased sales in other stores. The most significant storm related losses were related to the loss of merchandise inventories, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements at individual stores in the paths of the storms. During fiscal 2006, the Company received payments from its insurance carrier covering a majority of the losses. The net impact of these storms has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact in the aggregate on the Companys financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Fiscal 2007 Outlook Fiscal 2007 will be a 53 week year, compared with a 52 week year in fiscal 2006. The second quarter of fiscal 2007 will include 14 weeks compared with 13 weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, the Company plans to focus its efforts on the following initiatives designed to support sustainable and profitable growth and to make Family Dollar a more compelling place to shop, work, and invest. To support an enhanced food strategy, the Company plans to expand the cooler program to an additional 1,200 stores; increase its food assortment in approximately 2,000 stores; and install technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in approximately 1,000 stores. In Urban Initiative markets, the Company plans to continue to focus on driving better returns and to implement a new technological platform designed to facilitate better customer service and make the stores easier to manage. 16 In support of the Treasure Hunt program, the Company plans to further develop an event driven strategy that creates excitement for customers and employees; continue to focus on improving inventory flow and turns, resulting in better presentation of new products; and enhance the apparel assortment. During fiscal 2007, the Company plans to open approximately 300 stores and close 45 stores. The Company also plans to continue to build its site acquisition capabilities and increase its cross functional focus on new store performance. The Company will continue to enhance its research and development effort known as Concept Renewal. The Concept Renewal effort involves developing new ideas and initiatives designed to sustain profitable growth. The Company plans to continue testing new merchandising adjacencies and layouts through its Concept Renewal efforts. The Company will initiate a multi year investment designed to strengthen its merchandising and supply chain through a review of processes, personnel needs and technology tools. This will include price optimization, store clustering, category management, space management, merchandise planning and improved assortment planning. For fiscal 2007, the Company expects net sales to increase 7 9% and comparable store sales to increase 1 3%. As a result of the ongoing rollout of the Companys food strategy, the impact from Treasure Hunt merchandise sales and a continued focus on driving better returns in the Urban Initiative markets, the Company expects sales to accelerate modestly through the year. The Company believes that sales growth in lower margin consumables and low single digit comparable store sales will pressure its operating margin but expects to largely offset this pressure with better merchandise markups, lower inventory shrinkage, lower freight expense and the benefits from a continued refinement of operational and administrative processes. Using these assumptions, the Company expects that earnings per share for fiscal 2007 will be between $1.63 and $1.69. Results of Operations Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2006 were $6.4 billion, an increase of approximately 9.8% ($570.0 million), as compared with an increase of approximately 10.3% ($542.9 million) in fiscal 2005. The increases in fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2005 were attributable, in part, to increased sales in comparable stores (stores open more than 13 months) of 3.7% ($209.6 million) and 2.3% ($117.1 million), respectively, with the balance of the increases primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of the Companys store growth program. The comparable store sales calculation for fiscal 2006 excludes a limited number of stores that were closed for an extended period of time as a result of the hurricanes as discussed above. The Urban Initiative, the installation of refrigerated coolers and the Treasure Hunt merchandise program all had positive impacts on sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Sales of consumable merchandise and electronics, including pre paid cellular phones and services in fiscal 2006, were the primary drivers of the sales increase. See Item 1 Merchandise elsewhere in this Report for a breakdown of the percentage of sales attributable to each product category during the last three fiscal years. In fiscal 2006, the customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased approximately 1.2%, and the average transaction increased approximately 4.8% to $9.66. The Company believes that customers continued to reduce their shopping frequency in response to higher energy costs by consolidating trips around pay cycles. In fiscal 2005, the customer count decreased approximately 0.7%, and the average transaction increased approximately 2.9% to $9.22. The Company distributed four advertising circulars in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and one advertising circular in fiscal 2004. The circulars are designed to stimulate traffic and inform customers about the Companys Treasure Hunt merchandise, seasonal values and competitive prices on core consumables. During fiscal 2006, the Company opened 350 stores and closed 75 stores for a net addition of 275 stores, compared with the opening of 500 stores and closing of 68 stores for a net addition of 432 stores during fiscal 2005. The Company also expanded or relocated 24 stores in fiscal 2006, compared with 49 stores that were expanded or relocated in fiscal 2005. In addition, approximately 12 stores in fiscal 2006 and 105 stores in fiscal 2005 were renovated. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased approximately 9.4% ($367.9 million) in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 and approximately 11.8% ($412.3 million) in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. These increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume in each of the years. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 66.9% in fiscal 2006, 67.1% in fiscal 2005 and 66.2% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2006 was due 17 primarily to a more favorable merchandise sales mix, better merchandise markup and improved inventory shrinkage. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel costs. The opening of the Companys eighth distribution center in Marianna, Florida, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and its continued ramp up in fiscal 2006 have positively impacted freight costs by lowering the average distance to the stores from the distribution centers. Increases in transportation productivity and efficiency also offset some of the cost increases. However, these savings did not fully offset the impact of higher year over year fuel costs. The Company expects that the opening of the ninth distribution center in Rome, New York, during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, will continue to lower the average distance to the stores from the distribution centers and will positively impact freight costs. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was due primarily to the shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin consumables and fewer higher margin discretionary goods, increased inventory shrinkage and increased freight costs due to higher fuel expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased approximately 11.3% ($178.6 million) in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, and approximately 14.1% ($195.2 million) in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. The increases in these expenses were attributable primarily to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation and the ramp up of the ninth distribution center. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 27.5% in fiscal 2006, 27.1% in fiscal 2005, and 26.2% in fiscal 2004. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to increased compensation expense related to the expensing of stock based compensation and an increase in annual bonus compensation (approximately 0.4% of net sales), increased utility costs (approximately 0.2% of net sales), and a cumulative charge to adjust non cash stock based compensation expense (approximately 0.1% of net sales) as more fully described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. During fiscal 2006, the Company began recording stock based compensation in connection with its adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on SFAS 123R and its impact on the Company. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in store payroll expenses (approximately 0.2% of net sales). The reduction in store payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, resulted from the stabilization of store operations and the improved performance of Urban Initiative stores. In addition, most other costs, as a percentage of net sales, were leveraged as a result of improved cost control and the comparable store sales growth. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was due primarily to planned payroll expenses incurred in connection with the urban and cooler initiatives; increased occupancy and store related costs; and increased legal related costs. Each of these percentages was negatively impacted by a lower than planned increase in sales in comparable stores. A cumulative charge to correct property tax accruals on leased properties and the incremental costs of three additional advertising circulars also impacted this percentage, but these amounts were offset by a reduction in bonus costs as the Company did not reach the earnings target necessary for payment of management bonuses. In addition, most other costs, as a percentage of net sales, were negatively impacted by the lower than planned increase in sales in comparable stores. Litigation Charge During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a $45.0 million (approximately $0.18 per diluted share) litigation charge associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. All other legal expenses during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, including the Companys defense costs related to the above referenced case, were recorded in SG&A. Interest Income Interest income increased 74.0% ($2.9 million) in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. The increase was due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in investment securities. 18 Interest Expense On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained $250 million in aggregate proceeds through a private placement of unsecured Senior Notes (the Notes) to a group of institutional accredited investors. During fiscal 2006, the Company incurred $11.4 million in interest expense related to the Notes. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information on the Companys current and long term debt. Also during fiscal 2006, the Company recorded $1.4 million of interest expense relating to income tax adjustments as a result of changes to the measurement dates of certain stock option grants. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. The Company did not incur any interest expense during fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 37.3% in fiscal 2006, 36.5% in fiscal 2005, and 36.6% in fiscal 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005 was a result of the effect of changes in state income taxes and the expiration of certain federal jobs tax credits for employees hired after December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2006 was $451.0 million as compared to $299.4 million in fiscal 2005, and $376.5 million in fiscal 2004. These amounts have enabled the Company to fund its regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend payments, and interest payments. On August 24, 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for short term borrowings of up to $350 million. The credit facility replaced the Companys then outstanding unsecured revolving credit facilities for short term borrowings of up to $200 million. The credit facility expires on August 24, 2011. Any borrowings under the credit facility are at a variable interest rate based on short term market interest rates. Outstanding standby letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity of the credit facility. The Company had no borrowings against its credit facilities during fiscal 2006. The credit facility contains certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charges coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. Merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2006 were 4.9% lower than at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease in merchandise inventories was a result of the Companys renewed focus on inventory productivity and a shift in the timing of holiday merchandise receipts, which more than offset additional inventory related to 275 net new stores and inventory associated with the cooler program. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2006 was approximately 10% lower than at the end of fiscal 2005, excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers. The Companys focus on inventory productivity includes improved planning and flow of fashion merchandise and the use of more aggressive exit strategies. As a result, inventories in the apparel and accessories category have shown the most significant improvement in productivity. In addition, the continued expansion and refinement of the Companys centralized replenishment system has resulted in lower inventory levels of basic merchandise and better in stock levels. The decrease in capital expenditures to $192.2 million in fiscal 2006 from $229.1 million in fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the decrease in the number of stores opened during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Offsetting some of the decrease was the installation of refrigerated coolers in approximately 2,800 stores. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are expected to be between $155 and $165 million and relate primarily to new store openings; existing store expansions, relocations and renovations; expenditures related to technology infrastructure investments; and the continued implementation of a refrigerated cooler program for perishable goods in selected stores. The new store expansion will require additional investment in merchandise inventories. Capital spending plans, including store opening plans, are continuously reviewed and are subject to change. Cash flow from current operations is expected to be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and operational capital resource needs, including store expansion and other capital spending programs. In addition, the Company has available a revolving credit facility as previously discussed. During fiscal 2006, the Company purchased 15.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $367.3 million, as described below. During fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company purchased in the open market 3.3 million shares and 5.6 million shares, respectively, at a cost of $92.0 million and $176.7 million, respectively. 19 On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained $250 million in aggregate proceeds through the private placement of the Notes to a group of institutional accredited investors. On October 4, 2005, the Company executed an overnight share repurchase transaction with a bank for the acquisition of 10 million shares of the Companys outstanding common stock. The transaction was financed with the proceeds of the Notes. The total cost of the overnight share repurchase transaction was $234.2 million. See Note 4 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on the Companys outstanding debt and the overnight share repurchase transaction. Upon completion of the overnight share repurchase transaction the Company continued to purchase shares of its common stock pursuant to Rule 10b5 1 of the Exchange Act. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company purchased 3.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $100.0 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company purchased in the open market 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $33.1 million. On December 19, 2006, the Company entered into separate agreements in connection with the Notes and its unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreements extended the delivery date for the fiscal 2006 audited financial statements, the unaudited financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and the corresponding compliance certificates to March 31, 2007, and waived any Defaults or Events of Default that would have occurred due to the failure of the Company to deliver such information in connection with the Notes and credit facility. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, the Company formed a Special Committee of the Board of Directors to investigate the Companys stock option granting practices. As a result, the Company was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10 K for fiscal 2006 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by the required deadlines. As of the date of the filing of this Report, the Company has delivered the appropriate financial statements and compliance certificates and is in compliance with all covenants under both the Notes and credit facility. As of August 26, 2006, the Company had outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of approximately 6.1 million shares, consisting of 1.1 million shares remaining under an authorization approved by the Board of Directors on April 13, 2005, and 5.0 million shares remaining under an authorization approved by the Board of Directors on August 18, 2006. The following table shows the Companys obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2006: Payments Due During the Period Ending (in thousands) August August August August August Contractual Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long term debt $ 250,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250,000 Interest 118,691 13,387 13,387 13,387 13,387 13,387 51,756 Merchandise letters of credit 152,189 152,189 Operating leases 1,211,611 271,811 241,484 203,066 159,912 114,104 221,234 Construction obligations 5,393 5,393 Total $ 1,737,884 $ 442,780 $ 254,871 $ 216,453 $ 173,299 $ 127,491 $ 522,990 At the end of fiscal 2006, approximately $81.8 million of the merchandise letters of credit were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Most of the Companys operating leases provide the Company with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. See Item 2 Properties in this Report. The following table shows the Companys other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2006: Other Commercial Commitments (in thousands) Total Amounts Committed Standby letters of credit $ 122,082 Surety bonds 44,934 Total $ 167,016 20 A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) are used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to the Companys workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. The Company accrues for these future payment liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion. Included in the outstanding amount of surety bonds is a $41.6 million bond obtained by the Company during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 in connection with an adverse litigation judgment, as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123R, which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments (including employee stock options) at fair value, effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The FASB concluded that companies can adopt the new standard in one of two ways: the modified prospective transition method, in which the company would recognize share based employee compensation from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date; or the modified retrospective transition method, in which a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123), pursuant to which a company would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with SFAS 123. The Company adopted SFAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective transition method. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect SFAS 154 to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of tax positions and the related reporting and disclosure requirements and will be effective for the Company beginning with its first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, that FIN 48 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the first annual period ending after November 15, 2007. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of the companys financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. This approach is referred to as the dual approach because it requires both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements to be quantified. SAB 108 is effective for the first annual period ending after November 15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SAB 108 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Management believes the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 21 Merchandise Inventories: Inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less markon percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. The Company records adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, management makes estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, additional markdowns may be necessary. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal goods. The Company also provides for estimated inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory for the period from the latest physical inventory to the financial statement date. These estimates are based on historical experience and other factors. Property and Equipment: Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally five years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The Company generally assigns no salvage value to property and equipment. Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, impairment losses on fixed assets have not been material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Insurance Liabilities: The Company is primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation and general liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of the Companys retail locations and employees. Because the nature of these claims is such that there can be a significant lag from the incurrence of the claim (which is when the expense is accrued) until payment is made, the percentage increase in the accrual can be much more pronounced than the percentage increase in the expense. The Companys self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. Management reviews current and historical claims data in developing its estimates. The Company also uses information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation and general liability claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then the Company may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to the reported financial condition and results of operations. Contingent Income Tax Liabilities: The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. The Companys contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by the Companys historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as current income tax trends. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported financial condition and results of operations. Contingent Legal Liabilities: The Company is involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. The Companys reserves, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. The Company reviews outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The claims and proceedings are re evaluated each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and the reserves are adjusted or established, if necessary. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported financial condition and results of operations. 22 Lease Accounting: The Company leases substantially all of its store properties and accounts for store leases in accordance with SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases and related interpretations. For purposes of recognizing incentives, premiums and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation of intended use. For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, the Company records a deferred rent liability at the inception of the lease term and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock based Compensation Expense: The Company adopted SFAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair values. The determination of the fair value of the Companys stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Company also grants performance share rights and adjusts compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R in future periods, the compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing, investing and cash management activities. The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility at a variable rate of interest to meet the short term needs of its expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. The Company had no borrowings against its credit facilities during fiscal 2006. The Companys long term debt associated with the Notes bears interest at fixed rates. 23
