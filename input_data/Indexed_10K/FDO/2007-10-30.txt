ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and our expectations for fiscal 2008. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in the General Information section of this Report and the Risk Factors listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2007 was a 53 week year, compared with a 52 week year in fiscal 2006. The second quarter of fiscal 2007 included 14 weeks compared with 13 weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 Overview During fiscal 2007, our net sales increased 6.9% to $6.8 billion, net income increased 24.5% to $242.9 million, and diluted net income per common share increased 28.6% to $1.62, as compared to fiscal 2006. Our results for fiscal 2007 included the benefit of an additional week, as discussed above. In addition, fiscal 2006 was negatively impacted by: (i) a litigation charge of $45.0 million (a net impact of approximately $0.18 per diluted share) associated with an adverse litigation judgment; and (ii) cumulative charges of $10.5 million (a net impact of approximately $0.04 per diluted share) to record non cash stock based compensation and related interest expense. The various components affecting our results for fiscal 2007 are discussed in more detail in Results of Operations below. During fiscal 2007, we focused our efforts on these key initiatives designed to support sustainable and profitable growth: We continued to expand our Food Strategy. We installed refrigerated coolers in approximately 1,300 stores, and at the end of fiscal 2007, approximately 5,100 of our stores had coolers for the sale of refrigerated food. We enhanced the food assortment in all of our stores to reflect a greater emphasis on quick prep and ready to eat products, and we increased the selling space dedicated to the sale of food in approximately 2,700 stores. In addition, we installed technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in approximately 750 stores. We continued to enhance our Treasure Hunt strategy. We continued our development of event driven programs that create excitement for customers and Associates, and we sustained our focus on improving inventory flow and turns, resulting in better presentation of merchandise. We also enhanced our apparel assortment. We opened 300 stores and closed 43 stores. To improve the profitability and performance of our new stores, we continued to refine our site selection process and increased our cross functional focus on new store performance. We stabilized and improved the performance of new stores as we managed a more even flow of monthly openings and increased our cross functional support of new stores. In support of our Concept Renewal efforts, we opened or renovated 12 test stores in Charlotte, North Carolina. In addition, of the 300 new stores opened during fiscal 2007, 163 were opened in the Concept Renewal format. 17 Table of Contents To optimize our merchandising and supply chain processes, we launched a multi year initiative called Project Accelerate. As a result of this initiative, we instituted a stronger category management framework for merchandising decisions. Using this framework, we restructured our merchandising and supply chain organization, creating category teams with clearly defined roles for each category. We also created groups of operational specialists, like our pricing group, to provide our buyers with institutional expertise. Fiscal 2008 Outlook Fiscal 2008 will be a 52 week year, compared with a 53 week year in fiscal 2007. The second quarter of fiscal 2008 will include 13 weeks compared with 14 weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we plan to focus our efforts on the following key initiatives: To capture more of our customers frequent fill in food trips, we will continue the roll out of our Food Strategy. We plan to complete the cooler roll out with the installation of refrigerated coolers in approximately 575 additional stores, and we expect to expand the selling space for food in approximately 2,800 additional stores. We also plan to install technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in approximately 1,500 additional stores. We plan to continue to develop and refine our Treasure Hunt strategy. For example, in the home and apparel categories, we will continue to focus on providing our customers with a better assortment of quality family apparel and home d&eacute;cor at attractive values. We are also simplifying our promotional planning to make it easier for store Associates to create exciting events for our customers and to better manage residual inventory. The continued development of our global sourcing group will play a significant role in our success as we strengthen our quality and value proposition in these categories. We also plan to continue to selectively leverage national brands within our Treasure Hunt categories. Our Concept Renewal effort has allowed us to test new ideas in store layout and design with the goal of enhancing the customers shopping experience. We intend to evaluate several renovation strategies to assess the impact of incorporating the Concept Renewal elements in existing stores. Using our test stores, we will also begin to explore new ideas intended to make stores easier to operate and shop. We will continue our measured pace of new store openings so that we can continue to strengthen our support of new stores while also improving returns in our existing stores. We expect to open up to 300 stores and close approximately 70 stores. As part of our Store of the Future Project, we plan to roll out new point of sale technology in approximately 1,500 stores. We will continue to optimize our merchandising and supply chain processes through our Project Accelerate initiative. We plan to incorporate our category management framework into our planning, buying and logistical processes, and we recently installed a new merchandising and financial planning tool that should result in greater visibility to underlying trends to support more timely responses. We also plan to continue the development of our price optimization processes and our assortment planning capabilities. As previously noted, fiscal 2008 will be a 52 week year, compared with a 53 week year in fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, we expect comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3% from the comparable 52 week period in fiscal 2007. We expect to see continued improvement in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, as we continue to develop our Treasure Hunt strategy and Project Accelerate initiative, as well as our global sourcing efforts. We believe these improvements will mitigate the pressures from the implementation of our food strategy. We expect selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of net sales, will be primarily impacted by the level of comparable store sales growth as we continue to pursue our investments in key initiatives. Based on these factors, we currently expect diluted net income per common share will be between $1.74 and $1.85 for fiscal 2008, compared to $1.62 in fiscal 2007. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Sales Our net sales in fiscal 2007 were $6.8 billion, an increase of approximately 6.9% ($439.5 million), as compared with an increase of approximately 9.8% ($570.0 million) in fiscal 2006. The increases in fiscal 2007 and in fiscal 2006 were attributable, in part, to increased sales in comparable stores (stores open more than 13 months) of 0.9% ($58.5 million) and 3.7% ($209.6 million), respectively, with the balance of the increases primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Fiscal 2007 also benefited from an extra week of sales due to the 53 week year, as discussed above. In fiscal 2007, the customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased slightly, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1% to $9.69. We continue to believe that our customer is consolidating trips in response to economic pressures and the volatility of gasoline prices. In fiscal 2006, the customer count decreased approximately 1% and the average transaction increased approximately 5%. Sales during fiscal 2007 were strongest in Consumables, driven primarily by sales of food resulting from the implementation of our Food Strategy, and were weaker in Apparel and Accessories and Home Products. Sales of Seasonal and Electronics were impacted by increased sales of prepaid services, which are recorded on a net basis (only the markup on the sales of these products is recorded as revenue). See Item 1 Business Merchandise and Marketing elsewhere in this Report for a breakdown of the percentage of sales attributable to each product category during the last three fiscal years. We distributed five advertising circulars in fiscal 2007 and four advertising circulars in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The circulars are designed to stimulate traffic and inform customers about our Treasure Hunt merchandise, seasonal values and competitive prices on core consumables. During fiscal 2007, we opened 300 stores and closed 43 stores for a net addition of 257 stores, compared with the opening of 350 stores and closing of 75 stores for a net addition of 275 stores during fiscal 2006. We also expanded or relocated 10 stores in fiscal 2007, compared with 24 stores that were expanded or relocated in fiscal 2006. In addition, we renovated 22 stores in fiscal 2007, compared with 12 stores that were renovated in fiscal 2006. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased approximately 5.5% ($235.8 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and approximately 9.4% ($367.9 million) in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. These increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume in each of the years. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 66.0% in fiscal 2007, 66.9% in fiscal 2006 and 67.1% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2007, was due to the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services, which are reported on a net basis, as discussed above, a more favorable merchandise sales mix, better merchandise markup and lower inventory shrinkage. These improvements were partially offset by higher markdown expense. Freight expense, as a percentage of net sales, was substantially unchanged. The merchandise sales mix and the merchandise markup were positively impacted by our Treasure Hunt strategy and price optimization efforts related to our Project Accelerate initiative. We continue to focus on improving inventory productivity, through the continued refinement of our inventory replenishment system and the implementation of a more aggressive markdown strategy. The improvements in inventory shrinkage resulted from stronger inventory productivity, better visibility and store manager retention trends. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a more favorable merchandise sales mix, better merchandise markup and improved inventory shrinkage. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel costs. 19 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased approximately 10.1% ($177.4 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, and approximately 11.3% ($178.6 million) in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. The increases in these expenses were attributable primarily to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.3% in fiscal 2007, 27.5% in fiscal 2006 and 27.1% in fiscal 2005. As a result of low single digit comparable store sales growth and the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services, most costs in fiscal 2007 increased as a percentage of net sales. Increased professional fees (approximately 0.5% of net sales) and increased occupancy costs (approximately 0.5% of net sales) were partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs (approximately 0.2% of net sales). The increase in professional fees, as a percentage of net sales, was due primarily to expenses associated with the defense and settlement of certain stockholder derivative actions. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on the defense and settlement of the stockholder derivative actions. The increase in occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales, was due to higher store rental expenses (primarily property tax, insurance and common area maintenance reimbursements) and increased store maintenance, repair and utility expenses. In the future, we expect to mitigate against increases in occupancy costs through improvements in facilities management processes. The decrease in insurance costs, as a percentage of net sales, was due to favorable trends in workers compensation and healthcare claims. We believe that improvements in processes, lower inventory levels and increased store manager retention rates are contributing to the favorable trend in workers compensation claims. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 was due primarily to increased compensation expense related to the expensing of stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R) and an increase in annual bonus compensation, increased utility costs and a cumulative charge to adjust non cash stock based compensation expense in connection with the review of our stock option granting practices. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in store payroll expenses. In addition, most other costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of improved cost control and comparable store sales growth. Litigation Charge During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a $45.0 million (a net impact of approximately $0.18 per diluted share) litigation charge associated with an adverse litigation judgment. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. All other legal expenses during fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, including our defense costs related to the above referenced case, were recorded in SG&A. Interest Income Interest income increased approximately 54.2% ($3.8 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and approximately 74.0% ($2.9 million) in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. The increase in both years was due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in investment securities. Interest Expense Interest expense increased approximately 33.1% ($4.3 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2007 was due primarily to interest on taxes resulting from the Internal Revenue Service examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and interest on state income taxes. We did not incur any interest expense during fiscal 2005. Interest expense during fiscal 2006 ($13.1 million) was primarily due to interest in connection with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt on September 27, 2005. 20 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 36.4% in fiscal 2007, 37.3% in fiscal 2006 and 36.5% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was a result of the positive impact of a retroactive reinstatement of federal jobs tax credits, an increase in tax exempt interest income, and the effect of changes in reserves for state income tax contingencies. The increase in the effective rate in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 was a result of the effect of changes in state income taxes and the expiration of certain federal jobs tax credits for employees hired after December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007 was $415.8 million as compared to $451.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $299.4 million in fiscal 2005. These amounts have enabled us to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend payments, and interest payments, as well as a significant portion of our share repurchases. We maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $350 million. The credit facility is generally used to meet any short term liquidity needs resulting from seasonal inventory purchases. The credit facility expires on August 24, 2011. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. Outstanding standby letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity of the credit facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we borrowed $26.0 million under the credit facility in response to short term liquidity needs resulting from the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on the formation of the captive insurance subsidiary. The amounts borrowed under the credit facility were outstanding for a weighted average period of approximately six days. As of the end of fiscal 2007, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. We had no borrowings against our credit facilities during fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005. The credit facility contains certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of the end of fiscal 2007, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 were 2.7% higher than at the end of fiscal 2006. The increase in merchandise inventories was due primarily to the additional inventory resulting from 257 net new stores. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2007 was approximately 1% lower than at the end of fiscal 2006, excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers. The decrease in inventory on a per store basis during fiscal 2007 resulted from our continued focus on inventory productivity. During fiscal 2007, we continued to refine our centralized replenishment system to improve in stock levels for basic merchandise and continued our aggressive markdown strategy to effectively manage our fashion merchandise. We also improved inventory turns for the second straight year. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2006 was approximately 10% lower than at the end of fiscal 2005, excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers. We believe that the decreases in store inventory levels over the past two years are positively impacting merchandise presentation, inventory shrinkage and store manager retention trends. The decrease in capital expenditures to $131.6 million in fiscal 2007 from $192.2 million in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the decrease in the number of new stores opened during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and lower distribution and transportation investments. Offsetting some of the decrease was an increase in expenditures related to technology investments. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are expected to be between $165 and $180 million and relate primarily to new store openings; existing store expansions, relocations and renovations; distribution center improvements; expenditures related to technology infrastructure investments; and the continued implementation of our refrigerated cooler program for perishable goods in selected stores. The new store expansion will require additional investment in merchandise inventories. Capital spending plans, including store opening plans, are continuously reviewed and are subject to change. Cash flow from current operations is expected to be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and operational capital resource needs, including store expansion and other capital spending programs. In addition, as previously discussed, we have available a revolving credit facility. 21 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, we purchased 8.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $257.5 million. The shares were purchased in the open market or pursuant to Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During fiscal 2006, we purchased 15.4 million shares at a cost of $367.3 million, and during fiscal 2005, we purchased 3.3 million shares at a cost of $92.0 million. As of September 1, 2007, we had outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of approximately 2.9 million shares. We purchased the 2.9 million remaining shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Cash flows from operating activities During fiscal 2007, cash provided by operating activities decreased $35.2 million compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to changes in merchandise inventories and other working capital items in the ordinary course of business. Merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 were 2.7% higher than at the end of fiscal 2006. Merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2006 were 4.9% lower than at the end of fiscal 2005. The change in the deferred tax asset and the income tax refund receivable relate primarily to changes in the tax deductibility of insurance loss reserves in connection with the formation of the captive insurance subsidiary. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on the formation of the captive insurance subsidiary. Cash flows from investing activities Cash used for investing activities decreased $101.5 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the decrease in capital expenditures as discussed above. Cash flows from financing activities Cash used in financing activities increased $33.4 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily a result of a change in the financing of stock repurchases. During fiscal 2007, the repurchases of common stock were financed through the use of operating cash flows while a significant portion of the repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2006 were financed through the issuance of long term debt. The increase was partially offset by an increase in the cash overdrafts as a result of the timing of payments at year end. The following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2007: Payments Due During the Period Ending Contractual Obligations (in thousands) Total August2008 August2009 August2010 August2011 August2012 Thereafter Long term debt $ 250,000 $ $ $ $ $ 16,200 $ 233,800 Interest 105,303 13,387 13,387 13,387 13,387 12,609 39,146 Merchandise letters of credit 201,862 201,862 Operating leases 1,224,179 287,164 251,471 207,260 160,711 114,687 202,886 Construction obligations 4,123 4,123 Minimum royalties 17,100 1,200 1,950 2,350 2,550 2,750 6,300 Total $ 1,802,567 $ 507,736 $ 266,808 $ 222,997 $ 176,648 $ 146,246 $ 482,132 At the end of fiscal 2007, approximately $56.2 million of the merchandise letters of credit were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Most of our operating leases provide us with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. See Item 2 Properties in this Report. 22 Table of Contents The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2007: Other Commercial Commitments (in thousands) Total AmountsCommitted Standby letters of credit $ 167,191 Surety bonds 47,797 Total $ 214,988 A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion. Included in the outstanding amount of surety bonds is a $44.5 million bond that we obtained in connection with an adverse litigation judgment, as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS 154 as of the beginning of fiscal 2007. SFAS 154 has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of tax positions and the related reporting and disclosure requirements and will be effective for the Company beginning with its first quarter of fiscal 2008. We are currently assessing the impact that FIN 48 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS 157 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of a companys financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. This approach is referred to as the dual approach because it requires both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements to be quantified. SAB 108 is effective for the first annual period ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB 108 as of the beginning of fiscal 2007. SAB 108 has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits all entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, then it will report unrealized gains and losses on those items at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS 159 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 23 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Merchandise Inventories: Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less mark on percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2007. Property and Equipment: We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally five years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, our impairment losses on fixed assets, which typically relate to normal store closings, have not been material to our financial position and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal 2007. Insurance Liabilities: We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, and general liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and Associates. Because the nature of these claims is such that there can be a significant lag from the incurrence of the claim (which is when the expense is accrued) until payment is made, the percentage increase in the accrual can be much more pronounced than the percentage increase in the expense. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation and general liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent 24 Table of Contents claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we formed Family Dollar Insurance, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary based in South Carolina, to insure our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine insurance liabilities during fiscal 2007. Contingent Income Tax Liabilities: We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. Our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal 2007. Contingent Legal Liabilities: We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2007. Stock based Compensation Expense: We adopted SFAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair values. The determination of the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R in future periods, the compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2007. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on the Companys adoption of SFAS 123R. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility at a variable rate of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. Interest incurred during fiscal 2007 related to the credit facility was not material. Our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates. 25 Table of Contents
