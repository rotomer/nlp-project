ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and our expectations for fiscal 2009. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in the General Information section of this Report and the Risk Factors listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2008 was a 52 week year, compared with a 53 week year in fiscal 2007. The second quarter of fiscal 2008 included 13 weeks compared with 14 weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 Overview Fiscal 2008 was a challenging year for our customers, as higher energy prices and inflation outpaced wage growth, unemployment rates increased, and consumer confidence fell dramatically. In addition, turmoil in the financial markets led to significant uncertainty throughout the economy. As a result, our customers increased their purchases of lower margin consumable merchandise and constrained purchases of higher margin discretionary merchandise, which pressured sales and cost of sales. Despite the challenging economic environment, we were able to produce solid results during fiscal 2008 due to our ability to adapt quickly to the changing environment. We adjusted our merchandise assortment to focus on consumable categories, lowered inventory levels related to discretionary merchandise to manage inventory risk, and worked aggressively to reduce our expenses. We also received some benefit to sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as a result of the government stimulus program and additional advertising. As a result of these efforts, our performance in the second half of fiscal 2008 was stronger than our performance in the first half of fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, as compared with fiscal 2007, our net sales increased 2.2% to $7.0 billion, our net income decreased 4.0% to $233.1 million, and our diluted net income per common share increased 2.5% to $1.66. The results for fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 were negatively impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period, as discussed above. Sales in comparable stores (stores open more than 13 months) for fiscal 2008, which were reported for the 52 week period ending August 30, 2008, compared with the 52 week period ending September 1, 2007, increased 1.2%. We believe that the difficult economic environment faced by our customers, including higher energy prices and inflationary pressures, contributed to the low single digit comparable stores sales growth. The various components affecting our results for fiscal 2008 are discussed in more detail below. During fiscal 2008, we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives designed to increase revenues and improve financial returns as discussed below: As part of our Food Strategy, we installed refrigerated coolers in approximately 500 stores. As of August 30, 2008, approximately 5,600 stores had coolers for the sale of refrigerated food. In addition, we expanded the selling space for food in approximately 2,750 additional stores, and approximately 2,400 stores now accept food stamps. We continued to develop our global sourcing group, which helped to strengthen the quality and value of merchandise within our Treasure Hunt Strategy and lower our costs. As part of our Concept Renewal effort, we continued to incorporate improvements in store layout and design into new stores, and we renovated several markets to better understand the sustainability of performance improvements resulting from new layout and design elements. 18 We opened 205 stores and closed 64 stores as we continued to focus on improving new store performance. As part of our Store of the Future Project, we introduced new technology in approximately 1,650 stores, bringing the total number of stores with the Store of the Future platform to approximately 2,400 stores as of August 30, 2008. In connection with our Project Accelerate initiative, we began utilizing a new merchandise financial planning tool to support key merchandising decisions, and we implemented new category management processes. In addition, we created a structured framework for pricing decisions that enabled us to better balance the need for profitability with the customers perception of value. Fiscal 2009 Outlook During fiscal 2009, we plan to focus on driving revenues, mitigating risk and managing costs through the following key initiatives: In conjunction with our Food Strategy, we plan to continue the expansion of our assortment of traffic driving consumables, providing customers with more of what they need in a challenging economic environment. To strengthen the Family Dollar brand with customers and to reinforce the values we offer, we plan to increase our marketing and promotional events. We plan to continue the roll out of our Store of the Future initiative, upgrading the technology platform in approximately 1,300 additional stores. We expect that roughly half of our stores will be able to accept credit cards during the fiscal 2009 holiday season. To improve the customers shopping experience, we plan to renovate approximately 200 stores, leveraging key Concept Renewal principles. We will begin the implementation of new assortment planning processes and space management tools as part of the continuation of our Project Accelerate initiative. Through our price optimization work, the expansion of our private label offering and global sourcing efforts, we plan to continue to mitigate pricing pressure from rising commodity and raw material costs. Reflecting the uncertainty that exists in the current economic environment, we will continue our measured pace of new store openings so that we can focus on improving our returns on existing assets. We expect to open approximately 200 stores and close approximately 75 stores. For fiscal 2009, we expect comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3% from the comparable 52 week period in fiscal 2008. We expect to see continued pressure on cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, as our customers continue to focus on lower margin consumable merchandise and as diesel costs remain volatile. We believe that benefits from lower markdowns, global sourcing and improved inventory shrinkage could offset much of this pressure. While we will maintain a strong focus on controlling our cost structure, we expect selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of net sales, to be primarily impacted by the level of comparable store sales growth. Based on these factors, we currently expect diluted net income per common share will be between $1.58 and $1.78 for fiscal 2009, compared to $1.66 in fiscal 2008. 19 Results of Operations Net Sales Our net sales in fiscal 2008 were $7.0 billion, an increase of approximately 2.2% ($149.3 million), as compared with an increase of approximately 6.9% ($439.5 million) in fiscal 2007. The increases in fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2007 were attributable, in part, to increased sales in comparable stores (stores open more than 13 months) of 1.2% ($76.9 million) and 0.9% ($58.5 million), respectively, with the balance of the increases primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Sales during fiscal 2008 were negatively impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period, as discussed above. In fiscal 2008, the customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, was approximately flat, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.5% to $9.70, compared to fiscal 2007. We continue to believe that our customer is consolidating trips in response to economic pressures and the volatility of gasoline prices. In fiscal 2007, the customer count decreased slightly and the average transaction increased approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2006. Sales during fiscal 2008 were strongest in Consumables, driven primarily by sales of food in connection with our Food Strategy. Sales of more discretionary merchandise, including Apparel and Accessories, Home Products, and Seasonal and Electronics, were weaker. See Item 1 Business Merchandise elsewhere in this Report for a breakdown of the percentage of sales attributable to each product category during the last three fiscal years. Sales during fiscal 2007 were strongest in Consumables, driven primarily by sales of food resulting from the implementation of our Food Strategy, and were weaker in Apparel and Accessories and Home Products. Sales of Seasonal and Electronics were impacted by increased sales of prepaid services, which are recorded on a net basis (only the markup on the sales of prepaid services is recorded as revenue). During fiscal 2008, we opened 205 stores and closed 64 stores for a net addition of 141 stores, compared with the opening of 300 stores and closing of 43 stores for a net addition of 257 stores during fiscal 2007. We also expanded or relocated 27 stores in fiscal 2008, compared with 10 stores that were expanded or relocated in fiscal 2007. In addition, we renovated 70 stores in fiscal 2008, compared with 22 stores that were renovated in fiscal 2007. During challenging environments, our customers are especially sensitive to promotions as they manage with less spending capacity. We increased our advertising efforts during fiscal 2008 to emphasize the value we offer on both consumable and discretionary merchandise. Advertising costs, net of co op recoveries from vendors were $15.3 million, $4.1 million and $3.3 million in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. We traditionally advertise through circulars available in stores or circulars that are inserted in newspapers or mailed directly to consumers residences. In addition, we use limited advertising, including radio and grand opening circulars, to support the opening of new stores. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased approximately 2.8% ($125.6 million) in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and approximately 5.5% ($235.8 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. These increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume in each of the years. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 66.4% in fiscal 2008, 66.0% in fiscal 2007 and 66.9% in fiscal 2006. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2008, was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, was due to the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services, which are reported on a net basis, a more favorable merchandise sales mix, better merchandise markup and lower inventory shrinkage. These improvements were partially offset by higher markdown expense. 20 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased approximately 2.4% ($47.1 million) in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, and approximately 10.1% ($177.4 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The increases in these expenses were attributable primarily to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.4% in fiscal 2008, 28.3% in fiscal 2007 and 27.5% in fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2008, was due primarily to an increase in occupancy costs (approximately 0.5% of net sales) and an increase in advertising costs (approximately 0.2% of net sales). In addition, most costs in fiscal 2008 were de leveraged as a result of the low single digit comparable store sales growth. These increases offset a decrease in insurance costs (approximately 0.5% of net sales) and a decrease in professional fees (approximately 0.4% of net sales). The increase in occupancy costs was primarily a result of changes in accrual estimates. In connection with the implementation of our new lease administration system and the increased visibility to the underlying lease information, we refined our accrual estimates related to store rental expenses. Advertising costs increased as we began to increase our marketing efforts during fiscal 2008. With respect to insurance costs, as we have worked to improve processes, inventory productivity, and store manager retention, we have experienced favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability claims, resulting in a decrease in our actuarily determined insurance liabilities. Costs associated with the stockholder derivative actions during fiscal 2007 were not incurred during fiscal 2008, resulting in a year over year decrease in professional fees. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, was due primarily to low single digit comparable store sales growth, the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services, increased professional fees, and increased occupancy costs. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs. Litigation Charge During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a $45.0 million (a net impact of approximately $0.18 per diluted share) litigation charge associated with an adverse litigation judgment. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. All other legal expenses during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, including our defense costs related to the above referenced case, were recorded in SG&A. Interest Income Interest income increased approximately 3.3% ($0.4 million) in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and approximately 54.2% ($3.8 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The increase in 2008 was not material. The increase in fiscal 2007 was due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in investment securities. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased approximately 16.3% ($2.8 million) in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and increased approximately 33.1% ($4.3 million) in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The decrease in fiscal 2008 was due to an accounting policy change in the classification of tax related interest and penalties in connection with our adoption of FIN 48. Tax related interest and penalties were included in interest expense during fiscal 2007. The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2007 was due primarily to interest on taxes resulting from the Internal Revenue Service examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and interest on state income taxes. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 35.6% in fiscal 2008, 36.4% in fiscal 2007 and 37.3% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a decrease in the Companys tax liabilities as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations with respect to uncertain tax 21 positions and favorable settlements with taxing authorities. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was a result of the positive impact of a retroactive reinstatement of federal jobs tax credits, an increase in tax exempt interest income, and the effect of changes in reserves for state income tax contingencies. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2008 was $515.7 million as compared to $415.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $451.0 million in fiscal 2006. These amounts have enabled us to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend payments, and interest payments, as well as a significant portion of our share repurchases. On January 31, 2008, we entered into an additional unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for short term borrowings of up to $250 million. The credit facility has an initial term of 364 days and includes two one year extensions that require lender consent. The credit facility also includes a one year term out option that does not require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The new credit facility noted above is in addition to our $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring on August 24, 2011. Outstanding standby letters of credit ($185.9 million as of August 30, 2008) reduce the borrowing capacity of the $350 million facility. The $350 million facility also bears interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. During fiscal 2008, we borrowed and repaid a total of $736.3 million under our credit facilities, compared with $26.0 million during fiscal 2007. The maximum outstanding borrowing amount during fiscal 2008 was $170.8 million. We had no borrowings against our credit facilities during fiscal 2006. The borrowings during fiscal 2008 were used to meet short term liquidity needs resulting from seasonal inventory purchases and liquidity issues related to our investments in auction rate securities. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our auction rate securities. The borrowings during fiscal 2007 were used to meet short term liquidity needs resulting from the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary. During fiscal 2008, the credit facilities accrued interest at an average rate of 5.0%. As of August 30, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities. The credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 30, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Our inventories at the end of fiscal 2008 were 3.1% lower than at the end of fiscal 2007. Inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2008 was approximately 6% lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2007, excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers. We continue to focus on inventory productivity and have worked aggressively to limit our inventory risk in more discretionary merchandise categories. Merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 were 2.7% higher than at the end of fiscal 2006. The increase in merchandise inventories was due primarily to the additional inventory resulting from 257 net new stores. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2007 was approximately 1% lower than at the end of fiscal 2006, excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers. The decrease in inventory on a per store basis during fiscal 2007 resulted from our continued focus on inventory productivity. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were $167.9 million, compared with $131.6 million in fiscal 2007 and $192.2 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due to an increase in existing store improvements and upgrades and an increase in technology investments. The decrease in capital expenditures during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a decrease in the number of new stores opened during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and lower distribution and transportation investments. Offsetting some of the decrease was an increase in expenditures related to technology investments. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be between $140 million and $160 million and relate primarily to new store openings, existing store expansions, relocations and renovations, distribution center improvements, and expenditures related to store technology infrastructure. 22 Capital spending plans, including store opening plans, are continuously reviewed and are subject to change. Cash flow from current operations is expected to be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and operational capital resource needs, including store expansion and other capital spending programs and share repurchases. In addition, as previously discussed, we have available two revolving credit facilities. During fiscal 2008, we purchased 3.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $97.7 million. During fiscal 2007, we purchased 8.2 million shares at a cost of $257.5 million, and during fiscal 2006, we purchased 15.4 million shares at a cost of $367.3 million. As of August 30, 2008, we had outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of $133.0 million of our common stock. Our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary maintains certain balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities that are used in connection with our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks and are not designated for general corporate purposes. As of the end of fiscal 2008, these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were $0.5 million and $93.4 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities During fiscal 2008, cash provided by operating activities increased $100.0 million compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to changes in merchandise inventories and other working capital items in the ordinary course of business. Merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2008 were 3.1% lower than at the end of fiscal 2007. Merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 were 2.7% higher than at the end of fiscal 2006. The change in the deferred income taxes, the income tax refund receivable, and income tax liabilities relate primarily to changes in the tax deductibility of insurance loss reserves in connection with the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary as well as reclassifications due to the implementation of FIN 48. Cash flows from investing activities Cash used for investing activities increased $7.7 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was due primarily to the increase in capital expenditures, as discussed above. The increase in capital expenditures was substantially offset by a decrease in the net purchase/sale of investment securities, which resulted from the liquidity issues in the auction rate securities market. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our auction rate securities. Cash flows from financing activities Cash used in financing activities increased $28.4 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily a result of a decrease in cash overdrafts as a result of the timing of payments at year end and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Lower expenditures related to stock repurchases offset some of the increase.

Most of our operating leases provide us with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. See Item 2 Properties in this Report. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. In accordance with FIN 48, we have recorded $39.2 million in liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions as of August 30, 2008. At this time, we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities, except for $1.5 million which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next 12 months. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our adoption of FIN 48. The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2008: Other Commercial Commitments (in thousands) Total AmountsCommitted Standby letters of credit $ 185,945 Surety bonds 47,722 Total $ 233,667 A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion. Included in the outstanding amount of surety bonds is a $44.5 million bond that we obtained in connection with an adverse litigation judgment, as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of tax positions and the related reporting and disclosure requirements. We adopted FIN 48 during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the first annual period ending after November 15, 2007. The effective date has been delayed for non financial assets and liabilities to the first annual period ending after November 15, 2008. We do not currently believe that SFAS 157 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits all entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, then it will report unrealized gains and losses on those items at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not plan to elect the fair value option under SFAS 159. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (the GAAP 24 hierarchy). SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not currently believe that SFAS 162 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Merchandise Inventories: Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less mark on percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2008. Property and Equipment: We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally five years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, our impairment losses on fixed assets, which typically relate to normal store closings, have not been material to our financial position and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal 2008. Insurance Liabilities: We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, and general liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and Associates. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical 25 claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation and general liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. During fiscal 2008, our insurance expense was favorably impacted by reductions in our actuarily determined insurance liabilities, resulting from favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability claims. See our SG&A discussion above for more information. Contingent Income Tax Liabilities: We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. Our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. FIN 48 prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our adoption of FIN 48. Contingent Legal Liabilities: We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2008. Stock based Compensation Expense: We adopted SFAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair values. The determination of the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R in future periods, the compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2008. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on SFAS 123R. 26 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. During fiscal 2008, we incurred $1.7 million in interest expense related to our credit facilities. Interest incurred during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 related to our credit facilities was not material. Our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates. Our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid. As of August 30, 2008, we recorded a $7.8 million unrealized loss ($4.9 million net of taxes) related to these investments and classified them as long term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer refinancings, settlements with broker dealers, or upon maturity. However, volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Report for more information. 27
