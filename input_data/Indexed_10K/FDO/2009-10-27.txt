ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and our expectations for fiscal 2010. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in the General Information section of this Report and the Risk Factors listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were 52 week years compared with a 53 week year in fiscal 2007. The second quarter of fiscal 2009 and the second quarter of fiscal 2008 included 13 weeks compared with 14 weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Executive Overview We operate a chain of more than 6,600 general merchandise retail discount stores in 44 states, providing primarily low to middle income consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Our merchandise assortment includes consumables, home products, apparel and accessories, and seasonal and electronics. We sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than $1 to $10. During fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008, our net sales increased 6.0% to $7.4 billion, our net income increased 25.0% to $291.3 million, and our diluted net income per common share increased 24.7% to $2.07. Comparable store sales (stores open more than 13 months) for fiscal 2009 increased 4.0% compared with fiscal 2008. Our strong results during fiscal 2009 were due primarily to strong sales of consumable merchandise and improvements in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales. Although the economic environment remained difficult for our customers during fiscal 2009, with rapidly rising unemployment and a decline in average hours worked, we believe our customers benefited from lower energy costs and certain government stimulus programs. We believe our strategy of providing both value and convenience continues to resonate well with budget minded consumers. During fiscal 2009, we experienced an increase in customer traffic and the dollar value of the average transaction. Our customer research suggests that our core low income customer is shopping us more frequently and spending more when they shop at our stores. In addition, we are seeing growth in the number of shopping trips and average transaction from more middle income customers. The various components affecting our results for fiscal 2009 are discussed in more detail below. During fiscal 2009, we focused on driving revenues, mitigating risk and managing costs through the following key initiatives: We continued the expansion of our assortment of traffic driving consumables, providing customers with more of what they need in a challenging economic environment. During fiscal 2009, we initiated efforts to re align space in our stores to accommodate strong customer demand for consumable merchandise and improve the in store shopping experience. Approximately 48% of the chain was impacted by these efforts during fiscal 2009. To strengthen the Family Dollar brand with customers and to reinforce the values we offer, we focused on increasing the productivity and returns of our advertising and customer communications and improving our in store execution of promotional events. We continued the roll out of new register and point of sale technology in approximately 2,500 additional stores. As of August 29, 2009, approximately 4,900 stores were operating on the new technology platform. The new platform facilitates the acceptance of additional payment types, including credit cards and food stamps, and includes a number of computer based tools designed to provide our store managers with better training, analytics and work flow management. Through our price management work, the continued development of our private label offering, and our global sourcing efforts, we offset the impact of the shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin consumable merchandise. We continued to focus on inventory productivity, and we lowered our inventory levels in more discretionary merchandise categories. During fiscal 2009, total inventory decreased 3.8% and inventory per store decreased 5.0%, both in comparison to fiscal 2008. Lower inventory levels are making our stores easier to shop and reducing our exposure to seasonal markdowns. We also believe that lower inventory levels are resulting in lower inventory shrinkage and a reduction in workers compensation and general liability claims. 21 Table of Contents Reflecting the uncertainty in the current economic environment, we continued our measured pace of new store openings so that we can focus on improving our returns on existing assets. We opened 180 stores and closed 96 stores. Fiscal 2010 Outlook During fiscal 2010, we plan to build on the improvements we made during fiscal 2009 and maintain our focus on four key priorities: increase relevancy to the customer, drive increased profitability, manage risk and build great employee teams. To increase our relevancy to the customer we plan to continue re aligning the space in our stores to better meet customer demand and improve the in store shopping experience. In addition, we plan to complete the rollout of our new register and point of sale technology during fiscal 2010. We also plan to adjust our store operating hours to provide greater convenience for our customers and continue to expand our customer research efforts. In order to drive increased profitability, we plan to continue investing in initiatives that drive top line growth, and we remain focused on cost management. In addition to the initiatives already discussed, we plan to enhance our private label offering and global sourcing efforts and make additional investments to strengthen our pricing efforts. We plan to continue managing our inventory risk by constraining purchases of discretionary merchandise. We also plan to leverage the investments we have made in our Project Accelerate initiative and global sourcing efforts to improve inventory productivity and quality. We believe that our long term success is dependent on our ability to create strong employee teams that can adjust and respond quickly to ever changing conditions. We plan to continue to invest in building a stronger Family Dollar culture and great employee teams. We also plan to continue to focus on improving employee retention. During fiscal 2010, we expect sales will continue to be strongest in the Consumables category, as customers continue to constrain their discretionary spending. We expect cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, will continue to be pressured by the shift in the merchandise mix to more consumable merchandise. We plan to offset this pressure through lower markdowns, the enhancement of our private label program, improvements in price optimization, and lower inventory shrinkage. We expect selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of net sales, will be pressured as we continue to make revenue driving investments, including the re alignment of space in our stores, the roll out of new register and point of sale technology and the expansion of store operating hours. See Part I, Item 1 of this Report for more information on our current strategic initiatives. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our results of operations for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs: Years Ended (in thousands) August 29, 2009 August 30, 2008 September 1, 2007 Net sales $ 7,400,606 $ 6,983,628 $ 6,834,305 Cost and expenses: Cost of sales 4,822,401 4,637,826 4,512,242 % of net sales 65.2 % 66.4 % 66.0 % Selling, general and administrative 2,120,936 1,980,496 1,933,430 % of net sales 28.7 % 28.4 % 28.3 % Cost of sales and operating expenses 6,943,337 6,618,322 6,445,672 % of net sales 93.8 % 94.8 % 94.3 % Operating profit 457,269 365,306 388,633 % of net sales 6.2 % 5.2 % 5.7 % Interest income 6,595 11,042 10,690 % of net sales 0.1 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Interest expense 12,939 14,586 17,427 % of net sales 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 % Income before income taxes 450,925 361,762 381,896 % of net sales 6.1 % 5.2 % 5.6 % Income taxes 159,659 128,689 139,042 % of net sales 2.2 % 1.8 % 2.0 % Net Income 291,266 233,073 242,854 % of net sales 3.9 % 3.3 % 3.6 % Net Sales Net sales increased 6.0% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and 2.2% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increases in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were attributable, in part, to increases in comparable store sales of 4.0% and 1.2%, respectively, with the balance of the increases primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Comparable store sales includes stores that have been open more than 13 months. Stores that have been renovated, relocated, or expanded are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent that they had sales during comparable weeks in each year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Net sales in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, were negatively impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period. Fiscal 2008 was a 52 week year compared to a 53 week year in fiscal 2007. The additional week was approximately 2% of net sales in fiscal 2007. The 4.0% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2009 resulted from an increase in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores and an increase in the dollar value of the average customer transaction. During fiscal 2009, the customer count increased approximately 2.8% and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.2% to $9.84 compared to fiscal 2008. Sales during fiscal 2009, on a comparable store basis, were strongest in Consumables, driven primarily by sales of food. Sales in more discretionary categories continued to be soft, reflecting the current economic environment. The 1.2% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2008 resulted from an increase in the average customer transaction. During fiscal 2008, the customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, was approximately flat (0.3% decrease), and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.5% to $9.70 compared to fiscal 2007. Sales during fiscal 2008, on a comparable store basis, were strongest in Consumables. Sales in more discretionary categories were weaker. 23 Table of Contents During fiscal 2009, we opened 180 stores and closed 96 stores for a net addition of 84 stores, compared with the opening of 205 stores and closing of 64 stores for a net addition of 141 stores during fiscal 2008. We relocated 10 stores in fiscal 2009, compared with 17 stores that were relocated in fiscal 2008. We also expanded or renovated 41 stores in fiscal 2009, compared with 80 stores that were expanded or renovated in fiscal 2008. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we initiated efforts to re align space in our stores to accommodate strong customer demand for consumable merchandise and improve the in store shopping experience. Approximately 48% of the chain was impacted by these efforts during fiscal 2009. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 4.0% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and 2.8% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. These increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume between years. The increase in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period, as discussed above. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 65.2% in fiscal 2009, 66.4% in fiscal 2008 and 66.0% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, was due primarily to lower freight expense, lower inventory shrinkage, and lower seasonal markdowns. In addition, higher purchase mark ups more than offset the effect of stronger sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. Freight expense benefited from lower diesel costs and increased transportation productivity and efficiency. We believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from higher store manager retention, lower levels of discretionary merchandise and improved analytics and monitoring processes. As a result of the shift in the merchandise sales mix to more consumable merchandise and our continued focus on managing inventory risk, we lowered inventory levels in our discretionary merchandise categories, which resulted in lower seasonal markdowns, especially during the first half of fiscal 2009. The increase in purchase mark ups was due primarily to our price management work, including zone pricing and price optimization. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 was signed into law in August 2008. The new legislation addresses a number of consumer product safety issues, including the permissible levels of lead and phthalates in certain products. During fiscal 2009, we incurred markdown expense of approximately $6.8 million in response to the new legislation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased 7.1% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and 2.4% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increases in these expenses were due in part to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. In fiscal 2009, we also incurred additional costs to support higher sales volume. The increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period, as discussed above. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.7% in fiscal 2009, 28.4% in fiscal 2008 and 28.3% in fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, was due primarily to higher incentive compensation (approximately 0.3% of net sales) and higher insurance expense (approximately 0.3% of net sales). Most other costs decreased as a percentage of net sales, including payroll costs (approximately 0.1% of net sales) and occupancy costs (approximately 0.1% of net sales), as a result of a 4.0% increase in comparable store sales and our continued focus on expense control. The increase in incentive compensation was due to certain adjustments to bonus and other performance based compensation accruals to reflect our strong performance during fiscal 2009. We continued to see favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability claims during fiscal 2009, but the rate of improvement was lower as compared to fiscal 2008, resulting in an increase in insurance expense as a percentage of net sales. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, was due primarily to an increase in occupancy costs and an increase in advertising costs. In addition, most costs in fiscal 2008 were de leveraged as a result of low single digit comparable store sales growth. These increases offset a decrease in insurance costs and a decrease in professional fees. Interest Income Interest income decreased approximately 40.3% ($4.4 million) in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and increased approximately 3.3% ($0.4 million) in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, was due to a decrease in interest rates. The increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was not material. 24 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 11.3% ($1.6 million) in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and 16.3% ($2.8 million) in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. We did not borrow under our revolving credit facilities during fiscal 2009, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense as compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we incurred $1.7 million in interest expense related to our revolving credit facilities. The decrease in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due to an accounting policy change in the classification of tax related interest and penalties in connection with our adoption of FIN 48. Tax related interest and penalties were included in interest expense during fiscal 2007. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 35.4% for fiscal 2009, 35.6% in fiscal 2008 and 36.4% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to an increase in certain federal jobs tax credits and changes in state income taxes, offset partially by changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and a decrease in tax exempt interest income. The decrease in the effective rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a decrease in our tax liabilities as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to uncertain tax positions and favorable settlements with taxing authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources General We have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2009 was $529.9 million compared to $515.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $415.8 million in fiscal 2007. These amounts have enabled us to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend payments, interest payments, and share repurchases. We believe operating cash flows and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives. Credit Facilities On December 18, 2008, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for short term borrowings of up to $250 million. The credit facility replaced our $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on January 29, 2009. The credit facility has an initial term of 364 days and includes two one year extensions that require lender consent. The credit facility also includes a one year term out option that does not require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. We also maintain a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring on August 24, 2011. Any borrowings under this credit facility also accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. Outstanding standby letters of credit ($202.3 million as of August 29, 2009) reduce the borrowing capacity of the $350 million credit facility. There were no borrowings under the credit facilities during fiscal 2009, compared with $736.3 million borrowed and repaid in fiscal 2008. The credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 29, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Notes On September 27, 2005, we obtained $250 million through a private placement of unsecured Senior Notes (the Notes) to a group of institutional accredited investors. The Notes were issued in two tranches at par and rank pari passu in right of payment with our other unsecured senior indebtedness. The first tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $169 million, is payable in a single installment on September 27, 2015, and bears interest at a rate of 5.41% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, matures on September 27, 2015, with amortization commencing in the sixth year, and bears interest at a rate of 5.24% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has a required principal payment of $16.2 million on September 27, 2011, and on each September 27 thereafter to and including September 27, 2015. Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on the 27th day of March and September of each year. The sale of the Notes was effected in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. At the end of fiscal 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 25 Table of Contents Other Considerations Our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2009 were 3.8% lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. Inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2009 was approximately 5.0% lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2008. The decrease in total inventory and inventory per store during fiscal 2009 was due to a decrease in discretionary merchandise. During fiscal 2009, we reduced our purchases of discretionary merchandise and focused on meeting higher customer demand for consumable merchandise. Our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2008 were 3.1% lower than at the end of fiscal 2007. Inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2008 was approximately 5.2% lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in total inventory and inventory per store during fiscal 2008 resulted from efforts to improve our inventory productivity, including the continuation of an aggressive markdown strategy that began in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $155.4 million compared with $167.9 million in fiscal 2008 and $131.6 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in capital expenditures during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to a decrease in distribution and corporate office related projects, which offset increases in technology related projects and improvements and upgrades to existing stores. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due to an increase in existing store improvements and upgrades and an increase in technology investments. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 are expected to be between $160 and $180 million and relate primarily to store technology infrastructure and other technology related projects; new store openings; existing stores, to include expansions, relocations and renovations; and distribution center improvements. In fiscal 2009, we opened 180 stores, closed 96 stores and expanded, relocated, or renovated 51 stores. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we initiated efforts to re align space in our stores to accommodate strong customer demand for consumable merchandise and improve the in store shopping experience. Approximately 48% of the chain was impacted by these efforts during fiscal 2009. We plan to continue re aligning the space in our stores during fiscal 2010. We occupy most of our stores under operating leases. Store opening, closing, expansion, relocation, and renovation plans, as well as overall capital expenditure plans, are continuously reviewed and may change. During fiscal 2010, we plan to open approximately 200 stores and close approximately 80 stores. During fiscal 2009, we purchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $71.1 million. During fiscal 2008, we purchased 3.7 million shares at a cost of $97.7 million, and during fiscal 2007, we purchased 8.2 million shares at a cost of $257.5 million. As of August 29, 2009, we had outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of $62.0 million of our common stock. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased have been and will continue to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or transactions structured through investment banking institutions. Our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary maintains certain balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities that are used in connection with our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks and are not designated for general corporate purposes. As of the end of fiscal 2009, these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were $58.6 million and $59.3 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $14.1 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net income, partially offset by changes in income tax receivable/payable amounts. The changes in the income tax receivable/payable amounts were primarily due to a tax refund received during fiscal 2008 in connection with the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary. Cash provided by operating activities increased $100.0 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was due primarily to changes in merchandise inventories and other working capital items in the ordinary course of business. Cash flows from investing activities During fiscal 2009, we had a cash outflow from investing activities of $109.4 million compared to a cash outflow of $199.6 million in fiscal 2008. The change is due primarily to changes in the purchase/sale of investment securities. Due to volatility in the financial markets and the liquidity issues surrounding our auction rate securities, we did not purchase any investment securities during fiscal 2009 and only liquidated $44.9 million of investment securities. During fiscal 2008, we had a net cash outflow of $32.5 million related to investment securities. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our auction rate securities. Cash used for investing activities increased $7.7 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures was substantially offset by a decrease in the net purchase/sale of investment securities, resulting from liquidity issues in the auction rate securities market. 26 Table of Contents Cash flows from financing activities During fiscal 2009, we had a cash outflow from financing activities of $140.1 million compared to a cash outflow of $244.9 million during fiscal 2008. The change is due primarily to changes in cash overdrafts, an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and a decrease in purchases of our common stock. Cash overdrafts decreased $27.3 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and $79.7 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for an explanation of our cash overdrafts. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased $31.3 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Purchases of our common stock decreased $26.6 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Cash used in financing activities increased $28.4 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily a result of a decrease in cash overdrafts as a result of the timing of payments at year end and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Lower expenditures related to stock repurchases offset some of the increase. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2009: Payments Due During the Period Ending (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total August 2010 August 2011 August 2012 August 2013 August 2014 Thereafter Long term debt $ 250,000 $ $ $ 16,200 $ 16,200 $ 16,200 $ 201,400 Interest 78,529 13,387 13,387 12,609 11,760 10,912 16,474 Merchandise letters of credit 125,871 125,871 Operating leases 1,414,094 329,022 289,628 241,683 191,842 138,307 223,612 Construction obligations 2,817 2,817 Minimum royalties(1) 13,950 2,350 2,550 2,750 2,800 2,800 700 Total $ 1,885,261 $ 473,447 $ 305,565 $ 273,242 $ 222,602 $ 168,219 $ 442,186 (1) Minimum royalty payments related to an exclusive agreement to sell certain branded merchandise. At the end of fiscal 2009, approximately $50.5 million of the merchandise letters of credit were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Most of our operating leases provide us with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. See Item 2 Properties in this Report. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. In accordance with FIN 48, we have recorded $39.4 million in liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions as of August 29, 2009. At this time, we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities, except for $1.7 million which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next 12 months. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our adoption of FIN 48. The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2009: Other Commercial Commitments (in thousands) Total AmountsCommitted Standby letters of credit $ 202,288 Surety bonds 56,876 Total $ 259,164 A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion. Included in the outstanding amount of surety bonds is a $53.4 million bond that we obtained in connection with an adverse legal judgment, as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 27 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the first annual period beginning after November 15, 2007. The effective date has been delayed for non financial assets and liabilities to the first annual period beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS 157 during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits all entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, then it will report unrealized gains and losses on those items at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We did not elect the fair value option under SFAS 159. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 107 1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 28 1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1). This FSP amends SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This FSP also amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. The FSP is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 115 2 and FAS No. 124 2, Recognition and Presentation of Other Than Temporary Impairments (FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2). This FSP amends the other than temporary impairment guidance in U.S. GAAP for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. This FSP does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other than temporary impairments of equity securities. The FSP is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157 4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157 4). This FSP provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS 157 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. This FSP does not change the definition of fair value under SFAS 157. The FSP is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted FSP FAS 157 4 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS 165). SFAS 165 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. SFAS 165 is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted SFAS 165 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 168). SFAS 168 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also considered sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. SFAS 168 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. We do not believe that SFAS 168 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Merchandise Inventories: Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less mark on percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was $56.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2009 and $61.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2008. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts. Stores receive a physical inventory at least annually. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2009. Property and Equipment: We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally five years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, our impairment losses on fixed assets, which typically relate to normal store closings, have not been material to our financial position and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal 2009. See Note 1 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on property and equipment. Insurance Liabilities: We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense, which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs were $210.1 million as of the end of fiscal 2009 and $202.8 million as of the end of fiscal 2008. There were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. Our insurance expense during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs. See our discussion of SG&A expenses under Results of Operations above for more information. 29 Table of Contents Contingent Income Tax Liabilities: We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. Our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. FIN 48 prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were $39.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2009 and $39.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2008. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal 2009. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities. Contingent Legal Liabilities: We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our total legal liabilities were $53.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2009 and $51.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2008. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2009. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities. Stock based Compensation Expense: We adopted SFAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair values. The determination of the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R in future periods, the compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. Our results for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 include stock based compensation expense of $13.3 million, $11.3 million and $11.7 million, respectively. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2009. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on SFAS 123R. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. During fiscal 2009, we did not incur any interest expense related to our credit facilities. During fiscal 2008 we incurred $1.7 million in interest expense related to our credit facilities. Interest incurred during fiscal 2007 related to our credit facilities was not material. Our $250.0 million of long term debt bears interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.24% to 5.41%. Our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid. As of August 29, 2009, we had a $15.3 million unrealized loss ($9.5 million net of taxes) related to these investments. We believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer calls or refinancings, settlements with broker dealers, or upon maturity. However, volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item IA of this Report for more information. 30 Table of Contents
