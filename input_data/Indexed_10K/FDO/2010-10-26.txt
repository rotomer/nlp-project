ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and our expectations for fiscal 2011. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in the General Information section of this Report and the Risk Factors listed in Part I Item 1A of this Report. Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were 52 week years. Executive Overview We operate a chain of more than 6,800 general merchandise retail discount stores in 44 states, providing primarily low and middle income consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Our merchandise assortment includes Consumables, Home Products, Apparel and Accessories, and Seasonal and Electronics. We sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than $1 to $10. During fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009, our net sales increased 6.3% to $7.9 billion, our net income increased 23.0% to $358.1 million, and our diluted net income per common share increased 26.6% to $2.62. Comparable store sales (stores open more than 13 months) for fiscal 2010 increased 4.8% compared with fiscal 2009. Our strong performance during fiscal 2010 was due primarily to our strong sales performance and improvements in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, both as a percentage of net sales. Over the past several years, we made investments to improve processes, build merchandising capabilities and improve the productivity of our workforce. As a result of these investments, we are now building more compelling merchandise assortments, managing inventories more effectively and executing at the store level more consistently. These investments have also allowed us to shift our focus to driving stronger revenue growth. While general economic conditions may be stabilizing, we believe pressures on low and lower middle income customers continue to be significant. We believe our strategy of providing both value and convenience positions us well to increase our market share. During fiscal 2010, customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of our comparable store sales increase, while the dollar value of the average transaction was approximately flat. Basic consumable needs continue to be the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, but we are also seeing improvement in certain discretionary categories. For example, during fiscal 2010, we experienced strong sales in the Seasonal and Electronics category as a result of our increased focus on value, combined with appealing in store presentations and customer communications. Sales in the Home Products and the Apparel and Accessories categories showed improvement over the prior year. The various components affecting our results for fiscal 2010 are discussed in more detail below. During fiscal 2010, we focused on four key priorities: increase relevancy to the customer; drive increased profitability; manage risk; and build great employee teams. The following are some of the highlights from these efforts. We completed the roll out of new register and point of sale technology in all our stores. The new technology platform facilitates the acceptance of additional payment types, including credit cards and food stamps, and includes a number of computer based tools designed to provide our store managers with better training, analytics and workflow management. We expanded our operating hours in substantially all of our stores to increase the convenience of the shopping experience. In addition, to reinforce our value proposition and increase awareness of and loyalty to the Family Dollar brand, we worked to better integrate all of our customer communications. We increased the frequency of our communications to customers, and we improved our in store communications to reinforce our values and brand offering. We continued our space re alignment efforts to accommodate strong customer demand for consumable merchandise and improve the in store shopping experience. These efforts included re aligning the space in our stores to support an expanded assortment of key traffic driving categories, improving merchandise adjacencies and enhancing merchandise presentations. Since we began these efforts in fiscal 2009, approximately 65% of our stores have completed the layout changes. 21 Table of Contents Through our price management work, the continued development of our private brand offering, and our global sourcing efforts, we improved our purchase mark ups and offset the impact of the shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin consumable merchandise. We continued to focus on inventory productivity, and we lowered our inventory levels in more discretionary merchandise categories. While our total inventories increased at the end of fiscal 2010, due primarily to the expansion of our assortment of consumable merchandise and to support higher sales growth, our inventory levels remain well controlled. Lower levels of discretionary merchandise have reduced our exposure to seasonal markdowns, and we believe our focus on inventory productivity has contributed to lower inventory shrinkage and a reduction in workers compensation and general liability claims. We made great progress in our efforts to be a more compelling place to work. We strengthened our pay for performance culture and expanded our training and development programs. As a result, we drove continued improvement in our employee retention and internal promotion metrics, delivering more consistent execution for customers, increasing productivity and reducing costs. Fiscal 2011 Outlook Building on the improvements we have made over the past several years, we plan to continue to strengthen our value and convenience proposition in fiscal 2011. In addition, we plan to re accelerate our new store growth while also launching a comprehensive store renovation program. Our new store performance has improved significantly in the last several years as a result of the utilization of stronger site selection tools as well as enhancements driven by our strategic initiatives. Our operational improvements, combined with softening real estate markets and a growing customer base, have resulted in additional opportunities for new store growth. During fiscal 2011, we plan to open approximately 300 new stores, a 50% increase over fiscal 2010 openings. We also expect to continue building the pipeline for further acceleration of our new store growth over the next two to three years. Leveraging our concept renewal efforts, enhanced merchandising and supply chain capabilities, a refreshed store technology platform, and a better trained and more productive workforce, we are initiating a comprehensive renovation program intended to re energize the Family Dollar brand. During fiscal 2011, we plan to renovate 600 to 800 stores at a projected cost of $100,000 to $130,000 per store. The renovations will address both the interior and exterior of the stores and will create more customer focused assortments and layouts, rejuvenated physical stores and more customer centric teams. While we are making significant investments to drive revenue growth, we also continue to pursue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and financial returns. Key areas of focus will include the continued expansion of our private brand programs and the continued development of our global sourcing capabilities, as well as our ongoing efforts to improve operational productivity. See Part I Item 1 Business for more information on our current strategic initiatives. During fiscal 2011, we expect net sales to grow due to the acceleration of our new store growth and an increase in comparable stores sales. We expect comparable store sales to increase as a result of our current strategic initiatives, including our store renovation program and private brand programs, as well as continued benefits from expanded operating hours and other operational improvements over the past several years. We expect sales will continue to be strongest in the Consumables category, as customers continue to constrain their discretionary spending. We expect cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, to be approximately flat, as expected benefits from lower markdowns, the expansion of our private brand program, improvements in price optimization, and lower inventory shrinkage are expected to be offset by the investments we are making to improve quality and protect our price perception, combined with continued pressure from transportation expense. We expect SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, to decrease as a result of our comparable store sales growth and continued productivity improvements, which we expect will offset pressure from expanded operating hours, the acceleration of our new store growth and our renovation program. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our results of operations for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs: Years Ended (in thousands) August 28, 2010 August 29, 2009 August 30, 2008 Net sales $ 7,866,971 $ 7,400,606 $ 6,983,628 Cost and expenses: Cost of sales 5,058,971 4,822,401 4,637,826 % of net sales 64.3 % 65.2 % 66.4 % Selling, general and administrative 2,232,402 2,120,936 1,980,496 % of net sales 28.4 % 28.7 % 28.4 % Cost of sales and operating expenses 7,291,373 6,943,337 6,618,322 % of net sales 92.7 % 93.8 % 94.8 % Operating profit 575,598 457,269 365,306 % of net sales 7.3 % 6.2 % 5.2 % Interest income 1,597 6,595 11,042 % of net sales 0.0 % 0.1 % 0.2 % Interest expense 13,337 12,939 14,586 % of net sales 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Income before income taxes 563,858 450,925 361,762 % of net sales 7.2 % 6.1 % 5.2 % Income taxes 205,723 159,659 128,689 % of net sales 2.6 % 2.2 % 1.8 % Net Income $ 358,135 $ 291,266 $ 233,073 % of net sales 4.6 % 3.9 % 3.3 % Net Sales Net sales increased 6.3% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and 6.0% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The net sales increases in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 reflect increases in comparable store sales of 4.8% and 4.0%, respectively, with the balance of the increases due primarily to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Comparable store sales includes stores that have been open more than 13 months. Stores that have been renovated, relocated or expanded are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent that they had sales during comparable weeks in each year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The 4.8% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores. During fiscal 2010, the customer count increased approximately 4.3% and the average customer transaction increased approximately 0.5% to $9.91 compared to fiscal 2009. Sales during fiscal 2010, on a comparable store basis, were strongest in the Consumables and the Seasonal and Electronics categories. The 4.0% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2009 resulted from an increase in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores and an increase in the dollar value of the average customer transaction. During fiscal 2009, the customer count increased approximately 2.8% and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.2% to $9.84 compared to fiscal 2008. Sales during fiscal 2009, on a comparable store basis, were strongest in the Consumables category. Sales in more discretionary categories were soft. During fiscal 2010, we opened 200 stores and closed 70 stores for a net addition of 130 stores, compared with the opening of 180 stores and closing of 96 stores for a net addition of 84 stores during fiscal 2009, and the opening of 205 stores and closing of 64 stores for a net addition of 141 stores during fiscal 2008. 23 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 4.9% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and 4.0% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. These increases were due primarily to additional sales volume. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 64.3% in fiscal 2010, 65.2% in fiscal 2009 and 66.4% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, was due primarily to lower inventory shrinkage, higher purchase mark ups, lower freight expense, and lower markdown expense, which more than offset increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. We believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from higher store manager retention, lower levels of discretionary merchandise and improved analytics and monitoring processes. We continue to focus on improving our purchase mark ups through our price management work, the continued development of our private brand offering, and our global sourcing efforts. Freight expense benefited from improvements in inventory productivity, the impact of lower diesel costs on the first half of fiscal 2010, and increased transportation productivity and efficiency. Markdown expense benefited from strong sales of seasonal merchandise, our continued focus on improving inventory productivity and managing inventory risk, and the absence of any markdown expense during fiscal 2010 for products containing lead/phthalates. We incurred approximately $6.8 million of lead/phthalate markdown expense during fiscal 2009 in connection with new product safety legislation. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, was due primarily to lower freight expense, lower inventory shrinkage, and lower seasonal markdowns. In addition, higher purchase mark ups more than offset the effect of stronger sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased 5.3% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and 7.1% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The increases in these expenses were due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.4% in fiscal 2010, 28.7% in fiscal 2009 and 28.4% in fiscal 2008. Most costs in fiscal 2010, including occupancy costs, were leveraged as a result of a 4.8% increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements. As a percentage of net sales, decreases in insurance expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales) and utility expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales) more than offset an increase in store payroll expense (approximately 0.3% of net sales). Insurance expense continues to benefit from favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability costs, and our energy management efforts contributed to the decrease in utility expense. The increase in store payroll expense was due primarily to the expansion of our store operating hours. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, was due primarily to higher incentive compensation and higher insurance expense. Most other costs decreased as a percentage of net sales, including payroll costs and occupancy costs, as a result of a 4.0% increase in comparable store sales and our continued focus on expense control. Interest Income Interest income decreased $5.0 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and $4.4 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decreases in both years were due to lower interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased $1.6 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in fiscal 2010 was due to lower capitalized interest. We did not borrow under our credit facilities during fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2008, we incurred $1.7 million in interest expense related to credit facility borrowings. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2010, 35.4% in fiscal 2009 and 35.6% in fiscal 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to a decrease in federal jobs tax credits, changes in state income taxes, and lower tax exempt interest income, offset partially by a decrease in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The decrease in the effective rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to an increase in certain federal jobs tax credits and changes in state income tax, offset partially by changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and a decrease in tax exempt interest income. 24 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources General We have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2010 was $591.5 million compared to $529.2 million in fiscal 2009 and $515.7 million in fiscal 2008. Our operating cash flows are generally sufficient to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend payments, interest payments, and share repurchases. We believe operating cash flows and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives. We plan to fund future share repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations, and potential debt financings. Credit Facilities On December 16, 2009, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for short term borrowings of up to $250 million. The credit facility has an initial term of 364 days and provides for two one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The credit facility replaced our previous $250 million 364 day credit facility. We also maintain a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on August 24, 2011. Any borrowings under this credit facility also accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. Outstanding standby letters of credit ($153.9 million as of August 28, 2010) reduce the amount available for borrowing under the $350 million credit facility. There were no borrowings under the credit facilities during fiscal 2010. The credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 28, 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Our credit facilities mature within the next twelve months. We are considering various options to extend the maturity profile of our credit facilities. The availability and terms of any new credit agreement will depend on conditions in the credit markets. Long Term Debt On September 27, 2005, we obtained $250 million through a private placement of unsecured Senior Notes (the Notes) to a group of institutional accredited investors. The Notes were issued in two tranches at par and rank pari passu in right of payment with our other unsecured senior indebtedness. The first tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $169 million, is payable in a single installment on September 27, 2015, and bears interest at a rate of 5.41% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, matures on September 27, 2015, with amortization commencing on September 27, 2011, and bears interest at a rate of 5.24% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has a required principal payment of $16.2 million on September 27, 2011, and on each September 27 thereafter to and including September 27, 2015. Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on the 27th day of March and September of each year. The Notes contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 28, 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants. We are considering incurring additional debt in order to fund part of our $750 million stock repurchase program, which we announced on September 29, 2010. We have not yet determined whether to do so or in what form, and the terms and availability of debt financing will depend on market conditions. To facilitate new borrowing, we may make amendments to our existing credit facilities and or the Notes. In analyzing our credit we consider our ability to service not only our financial indebtedness but also our lease obligations. Other Considerations Our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2010 were 3.4% higher than at the end of fiscal 2009. Inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2010 was approximately 1.5% higher than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2009. The increases were due primarily to the expansion of our assortment of consumable merchandise and to support higher sales growth. We continue to constrain our purchases of discretionary merchandise as our customers continue to focus on basic consumables. Our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2009 were 3.8% lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. Inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2009 was approximately 5.0% lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2008. The decrease in total inventory and inventory per store during fiscal 2009 was due to a decrease in discretionary merchandise. During fiscal 2009, we reduced our purchases of discretionary merchandise and focused on meeting higher customer demand for consumable merchandise. 25 Table of Contents Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were $212.4 million compared with $155.4 million in fiscal 2009 and $167.9 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the investments we made to drive revenues, including improvements and upgrades to existing stores, distribution center improvements and technology related projects. We also purchased 20 of our existing stores from our landlords during fiscal 2010 and opened 200 new stores compared to 180 stores during fiscal 2009. The decrease in capital expenditures during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to a decrease in distribution and corporate office related projects, which offset increases in technology related projects and improvements and upgrades to existing stores. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are expected to be between $300 and $350 million. The planned increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 is due primarily to the acceleration of our new store growth and the launch of a comprehensive store renovation program. The remaining expenditures relate primarily to technology related projects and costs to begin construction of our tenth distribution center. In fiscal 2010, we opened 200 stores, closed 70 stores and expanded, relocated, or renovated 117 stores. In addition, we continued our space re alignment efforts to accommodate strong customer demand for consumable merchandise and to improve the in store shopping experience. These efforts included re aligning the space in our stores to support an expanded assortment of key traffic driving categories, improving merchandise adjacencies and enhancing merchandise presentations. Approximately 18% of the chain was impacted by these efforts during fiscal 2010. Since we began these efforts in fiscal 2009, approximately 65% of our stores have completed the layout changes. We occupy most of our stores under operating leases. Store opening, closing, expansion, relocation, and renovation plans, as well as overall capital expenditure plans, are continually reviewed and may change. During fiscal 2011, we plan to open approximately 300 stores and close 80 to 100 stores. In addition, we plan to renovate 600 to 800 stores at a projected cost of $100,000 to $130,000 per store in connection with a comprehensive renovation program that will create more customer focused assortments and layouts, rejuvenated physical stores and more customer centric teams. During fiscal 2010, we purchased 9.4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $332.2 million. During fiscal 2009, we purchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $71.1 million, and during fiscal 2008, we purchased 3.7 million shares at a cost of $97.7 million. As of August 28, 2010, we had outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of $129.8 million of our common stock. On September 29, 2010, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $750 million of our outstanding common stock. The remaining amount under the previous authorization was cancelled. On October 5, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution for $250.0 million. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased have been and will continue to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions. Our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary maintains certain balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities that are used in connection with our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks and are not designated for general corporate purposes. As of the end of fiscal 2010, these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were $42.1 million and $104.1 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $62.3 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net income. An increase in our merchandise inventories was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and changes in our income tax receivable/payable amounts, all in the ordinary course of business. Cash provided by operating activities increased $13.5 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net income, partially offset by changes in income tax receivable/payable amounts. The changes in the income tax receivable/payable amounts were due primarily to a tax refund received during fiscal 2008 in connection with the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary. Cash flows from investing activities During fiscal 2010, we had a cash outflow of $306.9 million compared to a cash outflow of $109.4 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was due to an increase in purchases of investment securities and an increase in capital expenditures. We purchased $142.7 million of investment securities during fiscal 2010 compared to no purchases during fiscal 2009. As the financial markets and global economy begin to stabilize, we are placing more of our available cash in short term investment securities. Our long term investment securities consist of auction rate securities that are not currently liquid. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. 26 Table of Contents During fiscal 2009, we had a cash outflow of $109.4 million compared to a cash outflow of $199.6 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease was due primarily to changes in the purchase/sale of investment securities. Due to volatility in the financial markets and the liquidity issues surrounding our auction rate securities, we did not purchase any investment securities during fiscal 2009 and only liquidated $44.9 million of investment securities. During fiscal 2008, we had a net cash outflow of $32.5 million related to investment securities. Cash flows from financing activities During fiscal 2010, we had a cash outflow of $340.7 million compared to a cash outflow of $139.5 million during fiscal 2009. The increase was due primarily to an increase in repurchases of common stock, offset partially by changes in cash overdrafts. We paid $332.2 million for purchases of our common stock during fiscal 2010 compared to $71.1 million in fiscal 2009. Cash overdrafts increased $49.7 million during fiscal 2010 compared with a $27.3 million decrease in fiscal 2009. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for an explanation of our cash overdrafts. During fiscal 2009, we had a cash outflow of $139.5 million compared to a cash outflow of $244.9 million during fiscal 2008. The decrease was due primarily to changes in cash overdrafts, an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and a decrease in purchases of our common stock. Cash overdrafts decreased $27.3 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and $79.7 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased $31.3 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Purchases of our common stock decreased $26.6 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2010: Payments Due During the Period Ending (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total August2011 August2012 August2013 August2014 August2015 Thereafter Long term debt $ 250,000 $ $ 16,200 $ 16,200 $ 16,200 $ 16,200 $ 185,200 Interest 65,141 13,387 12,609 11,760 10,911 10,063 6,411 Merchandise letters of credit 217,417 217,417 Operating leases 1,490,872 345,997 307,881 257,971 204,189 144,176 230,658 Construction obligations 15,335 15,335 Minimum royalties(1) 11,600 2,550 2,750 2,800 2,800 700 Total $ 2,050,365 $ 594,686 $ 339,440 $ 288,731 $ 234,100 $ 171,139 $ 422,269 (1) Minimum royalty payments related to an exclusive agreement to sell certain branded merchandise. At the end of fiscal 2010, approximately $79.3 million of the merchandise letters of credit were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Most of our operating leases provide us with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. See Part I Item 2 Properties in this Report. As of August 28, 2010, we had $23.4 million in liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. At this time, we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities, except for $5.2 million, which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next 12 months. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our tax liabilities. The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2010: Other Commercial Commitments (in thousands) Total AmountsCommitted Standby letters of credit $ 153,882 Surety bonds 3,419 Total $ 157,301 A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion. 27 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also considered sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The ASC combines all non SEC authoritative standards into a comprehensive database organized by topic. The ASC is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. We adopted the ASC during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption of the ASC did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued fair value guidance (ASC 820) that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We adopted the guidance with respect to financial assets and liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The guidance became effective for non financial assets and liabilities for the first annual period beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted the fair value guidance for non financial assets and liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010 06 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (ASU 2010 06). ASU 2010 06 requires new disclosures for significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the activity within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The updated guidance also clarifies existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation of assets or liabilities and the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, with the exception of the new Level 3 activity disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. We adopted the applicable disclosure requirements during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 09 Subsequent Events Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements (ASU 2010 09). ASU 2010 09 reiterates that an SEC filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued and removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. The updated guidance was effective upon issuance. We adopted ASU 2010 09 during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Merchandise Inventories: Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less mark on percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was $49.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2010 and $56.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2009. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts. Stores receive a physical inventory at least annually. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2010. 28 Table of Contents Property and Equipment: We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally five or ten years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, our impairment losses on fixed assets, which typically relate to normal store closings, have not been material to our financial position and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal 2010. See Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on property and equipment. Insurance Liabilities: We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense, which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. As of August 28, 2010, we recorded our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis, and recorded a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies. In addition, our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset were separated into current and non current amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The insurance liabilities in our previous filings were recorded net of amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies, and were classified as current liabilities. The prior year amounts in this Report have also been adjusted to properly reflect the gross insurance liabilities and related insurance asset, as well as the current and non current classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes were not material and had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income or Shareholders Equity. While certain changes were made to the operating section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to reflect the changes in operating assets and liabilities, there was no impact on total cash flows from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Our total liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs were $249.4 million ($63.7 million current and $185.7 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2010 and $255.6 million ($56.7 million current and $198.9 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2009. The current portion of the liabilities is included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in other liabilities. The insurance assets related to these amounts totaled $37.9 million ($3.2 million current and $34.7 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2010 and $45.5 million ($4.0 million current and $41.5 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2009. The current portion of the assets is included in prepayments and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in other assets. There were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. Our insurance expense during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008 was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs. See our discussion of SG&A expenses under Results of Operations above for more information. Contingent Income Tax Liabilities: We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business and we record contingent income tax liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were $23.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2010 and $39.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease was due primarily to the settlement of an income tax examination related to U.S. federal income taxes for fiscal years 2008 and prior. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal 2010. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities. 29 Table of Contents Contingent Legal Liabilities: We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our total legal liabilities were $4.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2010 and $53.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease was due primarily to the payment of the litigation judgment and other costs that were accrued in connection with the Morgan litigation. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2010. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities. Stock based Compensation Expense: We measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The determination of the fair value of our employee stock options on the grant date is calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued. If factors change and we employ different assumptions to measure stock based compensation in future periods, the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. Our results for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 include stock based compensation expense of $15.7 million, $13.3 million and $11.3 million, respectively. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2010. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on stock based compensation. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, we did not incur any interest expense related to our credit facilities. During fiscal 2008 we incurred $1.7 million in interest expense related to our credit facilities. Our $250.0 million of long term debt bears interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.24% to 5.41%. We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment securities. Our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid. As of August 28, 2010, we had a $11.4 million unrealized loss ($7.2 million net of taxes) related to these investments. We believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer calls or refinancings, repurchases by the broker dealers, or upon maturity. However, volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Risk Factors set forth in Part I Item IA of this Report for more information. 30 Table of Contents
