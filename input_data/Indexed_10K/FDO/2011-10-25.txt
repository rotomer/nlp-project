ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009, and our expectations for fiscal 2012. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in the General Information section of this Report and the Risk Factors listed in Part I Item 1A of this Report. Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were 52 week years. Executive Overview We operate a chain of more than 7,000 general merchandise retail discount stores in 44 states, providing primarily low and middle income consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Our merchandise assortment includes Consumables, Home Products, Apparel and Accessories, and Seasonal and Electronics. We sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than $1 to $10. During fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, our net sales increased 8.7% to $8.5 billion, our net income increased 8.5% to $388.4 million, and our diluted net income per common share increased 19.1% to $3.12. Comparable store sales (stores open more than 13 months) for fiscal 2011 increased 5.5% compared with fiscal 2010. Our strong performance during fiscal 2011 was due primarily to our strong sales performance and an improvement in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of net sales. Several years ago, we slowed new store growth to focus on improving returns in existing stores and the chain overall. We completed an end to end re engineering of our merchandising and supply chain processes, enhanced the performance of our store teams, refreshed our store technology platform, and created a store layout for new stores that is more convenient and easier to shop. As a result of these investments, we have upgraded our operational capabilities, increased profitability, gained productivity and expanded our financial returns. More importantly, these investments have provided us with a strong foundation to accelerate revenue growth. In todays uncertain economic environment, value and convenience continues to resonate with consumers. Our strategy of providing customers with value and convenience continues to attract not only our core low income customers but also middle income families with greater frequency. To continue to capitalize on this opportunity, we have launched several initiatives to enhance the customers shopping experience and improve their perception of our value and convenience proposition. During fiscal 2011, we continued to focus on achieving our four corporate goals: build customer loyalty and experience; develop diverse, high performing teams; deliver profitable sales growth; and drive continuous improvement. These goals are designed to drive both short term and longer term financial results. The following are some highlights from these efforts. We accelerated our new store growth and increased our store openings by 50% from fiscal 2010 to 300 stores. We renovated 972 stores under our comprehensive store renovation program. This program is intended to increase our competitiveness and sales productivity by transforming the customers shopping experience in a Family Dollar store. As a part of this program, we: expanded key consumable 23 Table of Contents categories and created more intuitive merchandise adjacencies; improved the navigational signage; leveraged new fixtures that enhance customer sightlines, increase capacity, and simplify restocking and recovery processes; created a warmer, more inviting shopping environment that includes a refresh of the building fa&ccedil;ade and exterior signage; raised store standards; improved store operating processes and leveraged technology to increase workforce productivity; and raised our customer service standards by strengthening our Team Member engagement with enhanced training, improved recognition programs and more consistent Team Member branding. To respond to customer demand, provide our customers with more value and convenience, and increase productivity in all stores, we significantly expanded our merchandise assortment in both food and health and beauty aids in stores that were not renovated in fiscal 2011, in addition to the stores we renovated. Our objective was to drive traffic with an expanded selection of consumables while also driving a larger basket with more impulse purchases and greater in store excitement. In fiscal 2011, we completed this expansion in more than 5,700 stores. We made significant progress in increasing our penetration of private brands. In fiscal 2011, private brands sales increased by approximately 22% over fiscal 2010. Private brands consumable sales performed especially well, increasing by 26% over fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, private brands sales represented approximately 25% of total sales and approximately 16% of total consumable sales. We launched an initiative designed to help us leverage our workforce more effectively, improve store level execution and increase workforce productivity. Through this effort, we re engineered many of our core store processes, including shelf re stocking, the check out experience, store recovery and in store merchandising. Through the application of new technology and processes, we implemented new time and attendance procedures, addressed workflow and task management, and improved store level execution. This has allowed us to more effectively manage store labor, a significant portion of our core expenses. Fiscal 2012 Outlook Building on the improvements we made over the past several years, we plan to continue to execute on our initiatives designed to deliver profitable sales growth, accelerate new store openings, and strengthen our value and convenience proposition in fiscal 2012. Our new store performance has improved significantly in the last several years as a result of the utilization of stronger site selection tools as well as enhancements driven by our strategic initiatives. Our operational improvements, combined with softening real estate markets and a growing customer base, have resulted in additional opportunities for new store growth. During fiscal 2012, we plan to open between 450 and 500 new stores, which we expect will achieve our goal of 5% to 7% square footage growth. During fiscal 2012, we plan to renovate, relocate or expand more than 1,000 stores. Building on the momentum of private brand growth in fiscal 2011, we intend to increase our penetration of private brands even further in fiscal 2012. We expect to launch several new brands that will offer our customers more quality and value while also refreshing a few of our existing brands to broaden their appeal. We intend to drive greater awareness of our private brand program through increased marketing and visual merchandising support. To continue to deliver profitable sales, in fiscal 2012 we plan to continue to expand our Global Sourcing teams, develop stronger processes to help us integrate our sourcing activities with our category management efforts, and continue to expand our supplier network. We expect these efforts will continue to increase our profitability and help to mitigate some margin pressures. During fiscal 2012, we expect net sales to grow due to the acceleration of our new store growth and an increase in comparable stores sales. We expect comparable store sales to increase as a result of our current 24 Table of Contents strategic initiatives, as well as continued benefits from operational improvements over the past several years. We expect sales will continue to be strongest in the Consumables category, as customers continue to constrain their discretionary spending in response to continued economic pressure. We expect cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, will be approximately flat. We expect that the adverse impact of stronger sales of lower margin consumables and higher freight costs will be mitigated by the expected benefits of private brands and global sourcing. We expect SG&A expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales as a result of our comparable store sales growth and continued productivity improvements, which we expect will offset increased expense pressure from our aggressive investment agenda. Results of Operations Our results of operations for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs: Years Ended (in thousands) August 27, 2011 August 28, 2010 August 29, 2009 Net sales $ 8,547,835 $ 7,866,971 $ 7,400,606 Cost and expenses: Cost of sales 5,515,540 5,058,971 4,822,401 % of net sales 64.5 % 64.3 % 65.2 % Selling, general and administrative 2,394,223 2,232,402 2,120,936 % of net sales 28.0 % 28.4 % 28.7 % Cost of sales and operating expenses 7,909,763 7,291,373 6,943,337 % of net sales 92.5 % 92.7 % 93.8 % Operating profit 638,072 575,598 457,269 % of net sales 7.5 % 7.3 % 6.2 % Investment income 1,532 1,597 6,595 % of net sales 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Interest expense 22,446 13,337 12,939 % of net sales 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Income before income taxes 617,158 563,858 450,925 % of net sales 7.2 % 7.2 % 6.1 % Income taxes 228,713 205,723 159,659 % of net sales 2.7 % 2.6 % 2.2 % Net Income $ 388,445 $ 358,135 $ 291,266 % of net sales 4.5 % 4.6 % 3.9 % Net Sales Net sales increased 8.7% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, and 6.3% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The net sales increases in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 reflect increases in comparable store sales of 5.5% and 4.8%, respectively, with the balance of the increases due primarily to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Comparable store sales include stores that have been open more than 13 months. Stores that have been renovated, relocated or expanded are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent that they had sales during comparable weeks in each year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The 5.5% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2011 resulted from increases in both customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, and the dollar value of the average customer transaction. 25 Table of Contents During fiscal 2011, the customer count increased approximately 4.0%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.5% compared to fiscal 2010. Sales during fiscal 2011 were strongest in the Consumables category. The 4.8% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2010 resulted from an increase in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions and an increase in the dollar value of the average customer transaction. During fiscal 2010, the customer count increased approximately 4.3%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 0.5% compared to fiscal 2009. Sales during fiscal 2010 were strongest in the Consumables and Seasonal and Electronics categories. During fiscal 2011, we opened 300 stores and closed 62 stores for a net addition of 238 stores, compared with the opening of 200 stores and closing of 70 stores for a net addition of 130 stores during fiscal 2010, and the opening of 180 stores and closing of 96 stores for a net addition of 84 stores during fiscal 2009. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 9.0% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and 4.9% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. These increases were due primarily to additional sales volume. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 64.5% in fiscal 2011, 64.3% in fiscal 2010, and 65.2% in fiscal 2009. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was a result of the impact of stronger sales in lower margin consumables merchandise and increased freight costs, partially offset by lower inventory shrinkage. The impact of stronger sales of lower margin consumables was slightly offset by the effect of higher purchase mark ups in many categories. We continue to focus on improving our purchase mark ups through our price management, the continued development of our private brand assortment, and our global sourcing efforts. Freight costs were negatively impacted by higher diesel costs. We believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from workforce stabilization in our stores and improved analytics and monitoring processes. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, was due primarily to lower inventory shrinkage, higher purchase mark ups, lower freight expense, and lower markdown expense, which more than offset increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. We believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from higher store manager retention, lower levels of discretionary merchandise and improved analytics and monitoring processes. We continued to focus on improving our purchase mark ups through our price management, the continued development of our private brand offering, and our global sourcing efforts. Freight expense benefited from improvements in inventory productivity, the impact of lower diesel costs on the first half of fiscal 2010, and increased transportation productivity and efficiency. Markdown expense benefited from strong sales of seasonal merchandise, our continued focus on improving inventory productivity and managing inventory risk, and the absence of any markdown expense during fiscal 2010 for products containing lead/phthalates. We incurred approximately $6.8 million of lead/phthalate markdown expense during fiscal 2009 in connection with new product safety legislation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased 7.2% in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, and 5.3% in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. The increases in these expenses were due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.0% in fiscal 2011, 28.4% in fiscal 2010, and 28.7% in fiscal 2009. Most expenses in fiscal 2011 were leveraged as a result of a 5.5% increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements. The increased comparable store sales volumes helped offset our investments to drive revenue growth, including store renovations, extended store hours and enhanced marketing efforts. In addition, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were leveraged as a result of lower non store payroll costs, including incentive compensation expense, (approximately 0.3% of net sales) in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Reflecting our pay for performance philosophy, incentive compensation costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our relative performance against our target in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. 26 Table of Contents Most costs in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, including occupancy costs, were leveraged as a result of a 4.8% increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements. As a percentage of net sales, decreases in insurance expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales) and utility expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales) more than offset an increase in store payroll expense (approximately 0.3% of net sales). Insurance expense continued to benefit from favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability costs, and our energy management efforts contributed to the decrease in utility expense. The increase in store payroll expense was due primarily to the expansion of our store operating hours. Investment Income Investment income decreased $0.1 million in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, and $5.0 million in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. The decreases in both years were primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $9.1 million in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, and increased $0.4 million in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. On January 28, 2011, we issued $300 million in senior unsecured notes with a coupon rate of 5.00% maturing in 2021 (the 2021 Notes). During fiscal 2011, we incurred $8.9 million in interest expense related to the 2021 Notes. We did not incur any interest expense during fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 related to the 2021 Notes. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 37.1% for fiscal 2011, 36.5% in fiscal 2010, and 35.4% in fiscal 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to an increase in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and increases in valuation allowances, partially offset by an increase in federal jobs tax credits. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to a decrease in federal jobs tax credits, changes in state income taxes, and lower tax exempt interest income, offset partially by a decrease in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Liquidity and Capital Resources General We have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011 was $528.1 million compared to $591.5 million in fiscal 2010 and $529.2 million in fiscal 2009. Our operating cash flows are generally sufficient to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend payments, share repurchases, interest payments, and debt maturities. In fiscal 2011, we completed an initial public debt offering to supplement operating cash flows to provide additional capital for our investment initiatives and share repurchase program. We believe operating cash flows and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations, including our lease obligations and growth initiatives. Credit Facilities On November 17, 2010, we entered into a new four year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $400 million. The credit facility matures on November 17, 2014, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The credit facility replaced the previous 364 day $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility. On August 17, 2011, we entered into a new five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $300 million. The credit facility matures on August 17, 2016, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The credit facility replaced the previous five year $200 million unsecured credit facility. 27 Table of Contents During fiscal 2011, we borrowed $46.0 million under the credit facilities at a weighted average interest rate of 1.3%. As of August 27, 2011, and August 28, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities. The credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 27, 2011, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Long Term Debt On January 28, 2011, we issued $300 million of 5.00% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2021 (the 2021 Notes), through a public offering. Our proceeds were approximately $298.5 million, net of an issuance discount of $1.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of approximately $3.3 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2021 Notes. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on the 1st day of February and August of each year, commencing on August 1, 2011. The 2021 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with our other unsecured senior indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at our option, subject to a make whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the 2021 Notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The proceeds of the issuance were used to fund our share repurchase program and for general corporate purposes. On September 27, 2005, we obtained $250 million through a private placement of unsecured senior notes due September 27, 2015 (the 2015 Notes), to a group of institutional accredited investors. The 2015 Notes were issued in two tranches at par and rank pari passu in right of payment with our other unsecured senior indebtedness. The first tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $169 million, is payable in a single installment on September 27, 2015, and bears interest at a rate of 5.41% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, matures on September 27, 2015, with amortization commencing on September 27, 2011, and bears interest at a rate of 5.24% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has a required principal payment of $16.2 million on September 27, 2011, and on each September 27 thereafter to and including September 27, 2015. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on the 27th day of March and September of each year. The 2015 Notes contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 27, 2011, we were in compliance with all such covenants. On November 17, 2010, we amended the 2015 Notes to remove the subsidiary co borrower and all subsidiary guarantors. Other Considerations Our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2011 were 12.3% higher than at the end of fiscal 2010. Inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2011 was approximately 9% higher than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2010. The increases were due primarily to the expansion of our assortment of consumable merchandise. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 were $345.3 million, compared with $212.4 million in fiscal 2010, and $155.4 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was due primarily to the investments we made to drive revenue growth, including our comprehensive store renovation program, other improvements and upgrades to existing stores, purchases of new and existing stores, and supply chain projects (including the start of construction of the 10th distribution center). In fiscal 2011, we purchased 44 stores, including existing stores from our landlords and the construction of new stores, compared to 20 existing stores purchased from our landlords in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we opened 300 new stores, 28 Table of Contents compared to 200 new stores during fiscal 2010. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the investments we made to drive revenues, including improvements and upgrades to existing stores, distribution center improvements and technology related projects. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are expected to be between $550 and $600 million. The planned increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 is due primarily to our efforts to support new store openings, execute our comprehensive store renovation program and invest in our distribution network. In fiscal 2012, we expect to increase the number of stores we own through the initial construction of stores as we look to leverage our lower cost of capital compared to the developers higher rate and reduce our effective cost of ownership. Also, in fiscal 2012, we expect to renovate, relocate or expand more than 1,000 stores. We also plan to complete construction of our 10th distribution center and begin construction of our 11th distribution center. During fiscal 2011, we purchased 13.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $670.5 million, compared to 9.4 million shares at a cost of $332.2 million in fiscal 2010, and 2.3 million shares at a cost of $71.1 million in fiscal 2009. On September 28, 2011, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to an additional $250 million of the Companys outstanding common stock. As such, after the announcement, the Company had $337.3 million remaining under current authorizations. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased have been and will continue to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our share repurchase programs do not have a stated expiration date, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions. Our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary maintains certain balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities that are used in connection with our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks and are not designated for general corporate purposes. As of the end of fiscal 2011, these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were $53.2 million, and $93.0 million, respectively. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased $63.5 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in merchandise inventories primarily offset by changes in other liabilities and higher net income, all in the ordinary course of business. Cash provided by operating activities increased $62.3 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net income. An increase in our merchandise inventories was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and changes in our income tax receivable/payable amounts, all in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities decreased $26.5 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. The change was due primarily to a net increase in sales of investment securities in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $132.8 million. The net increase in sales of investment securities was due to the continued liquidation of our auction rate securities and the increase in capital expenditures as discussed above. Cash used in investing activities increased $197.6 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was due to an increase in purchases of investment securities and an increase in capital expenditures. We purchased $142.7 million of investment securities during fiscal 2010, compared to no purchases during fiscal 2009. Due to volatility in the financial markets and the liquidity issues surrounding our auction rate securities, we did not purchase any investment securities during fiscal 2009 and only liquidated $44.9 million of investment securities. 29 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities increased $148.3 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and changes in cash overdrafts, partially offset by the issuance of new debt. During fiscal 2011, we purchased $670.5 million of our common stock, as compared to $332.2 million in fiscal 2010. Cash overdrafts decreased $47.7 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to an increase of $49.7 million in fiscal 2010. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for an explanation of our cash overdrafts. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, we issued $300 million of 5.00% unsecured senior notes, creating a significant cash inflow from financing activities as compared to fiscal 2010. Cash used in financing activities increased $201.3 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was due primarily to an increase in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by changes in cash overdrafts. We paid $332.2 million for purchases of our common stock during fiscal 2010 compared to $71.1 million in fiscal 2009. Cash overdrafts increased $49.7 million during fiscal 2010 compared with a $27.3 million decrease in fiscal 2009. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2011.

At the end of fiscal 2011, approximately $92.5 million of the merchandise letters of credit were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Most of our operating leases provide us with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. See Part I Item 2 Properties in this Report. As of August 27, 2011, we had $26.3 million in liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. At this time, we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities, except for $4.9 million, which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next 12 months. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our tax liabilities. The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2011. Other Commercial Commitments (in thousands) Total AmountsCommitted Standby letters of credit $ 137,982 Surety bonds 9,445 Total $ 147,427 30 Table of Contents A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent purchase authorizations that can be canceled. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases included in the Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments section above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2011 04 Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011 04). ASU 2011 04 amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. The new guidance is effective for fiscal year and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05 Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05). ASU 2011 05 allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. While ASU 2011 05 changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. The new guidance is effective for fiscal year and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Merchandise Inventories: Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less mark on percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of sales when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, 31 Table of Contents we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was $48.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2011 and $49.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2010. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts. Stores receive a physical inventory at least annually. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2011. Property and Equipment: We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally five or ten years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, our impairment losses on fixed assets, which typically relate to normal store closings, have not been material to our financial position and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal 2011. See Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on property and equipment. Insurance Liabilities: We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense, which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. We record our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis, and record a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset are separated into current and non current amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our total liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs were $249.6 million ($56.4 million current and $193.2 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2011, and $249.4 million ($63.7 million current and $185.7 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2010. The current portion of the liabilities is included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in other liabilities. The insurance assets related to these amounts totaled $36.7 million ($3.0 million current and 32 Table of Contents $33.7 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2011, and $37.9 million ($3.2 million current and $34.7 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2010. The current portion of the assets is included in prepayments and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in other assets. There were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010. Our insurance expense during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs. See our discussion of SG&A expenses under Results of Operations above for more information. Contingent Income Tax Liabilities: We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business and we record contingent income tax liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were $26.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2011, and $23.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2010. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal 2011. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities. Contingent Legal Liabilities: We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our total legal liabilities were not material as of the end of fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2011. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities. Stock based Compensation Expense: We measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The determination of the fair value of our employee stock options on the grant date is calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued. If factors change and we employ different assumptions to measure stock based compensation in future periods, the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. Our results for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 include stock based compensation expense of $14.7 million, $15.7 million and $13.3 million, respectively. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2011. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on stock based compensation. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. During fiscal 2011, we incurred an immaterial amount of interest expense related to our credit facilities. We did not incur any interest expense related to our credit facilities in fiscal 2010. We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment securities. Our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid. As of August 27, 2011, we had a $9.3 million unrealized loss ($5.8 million net of taxes) related to these investments. We believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer calls or refinancings, repurchases by the broker dealers, or upon maturity. However, volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Risk Factors set forth in Part I Item IA of this Report for more information. 34 Table of Contents
