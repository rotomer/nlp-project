ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, and our expectations for fiscal 2013. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in the General Information section of this Report and the Risk Factors listed in Part IItem 1A of this Report.Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were 52 week years. Fiscal 2013 will be a 53 week year.Executive OverviewWe operate a chain of more than 7,400 general merchandise retail discount stores in 45 states, providing primarily low and middle income consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Our merchandise assortment includes Consumables, Home Products, Apparel and Accessories, and Seasonal and Electronics. We sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than $1 to $10.During fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, our net sales increased 9.2% to $9.3 billion, our net income increased 8.7% to $422.2 million, and our diluted net income per common share increased 14.7% to $3.58. Comparable store sales (stores open more than 13 months) for fiscal 2012 increased 4.7% compared with fiscal 2011. Our strong performance during fiscal 2012 was due primarily to our strong sales performance and an improvement in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of net sales.Several years ago, we slowed new store growth to focus on improving returns in existing stores and the chain overall. Over this period, we completed an end to end re engineering of our merchandising and supply chain processes, enhanced the productivity of our store teams, refreshed our store technology platform, and created a store layout for new stores that is more convenient and easier to shop. As a result of these investments, we have upgraded our operational capabilities, increased profitability, gained productivity and expanded our financial returns. More importantly, these investments provided us with a strong foundation to accelerate revenue growth.In todays uncertain economic environment, value and convenience continues to resonate with consumers. Our strategy of providing customers with value and convenience continues to attract not only our core low income customers but also middle income families with greater frequency. To continue to capitalize on this opportunity, we have launched several initiatives to increase our relevancy to customers by enhancing their shopping experience and to improve their perception of our value and convenience proposition.During fiscal 2012, we continued to focus on achieving our four corporate goals: build customer loyalty and experience; deliver profitable sales growth; drive continuous improvement; and develop diverse, high performing teams. These goals are designed to drive both short term and longer term financial results. The following are some highlights from these efforts.We accelerated our new store growth and increased our store openings by more than 50% from fiscal 2011 to 475 stores, including our first stores in California.We renovated, relocated or expanded 854 stores under our comprehensive store renovation program. This program is intended to increase our competitiveness and sales productivity by transforming the customers shopping experience in a Family Dollar store. As a part of this program, we: expanded key consumable categories and created more intuitive merchandise adjacencies; improved the navigational signage; leveraged new fixtures that enhance customer sightlines, increase capacity, and simplify restocking and recovery processes; created a warmer, more inviting shopping environment that includes a refresh of the building faade and exterior signage; raised store standards; improved store operating processes and leveraged technology to increase workforce productivity; and raised our customer service standards by strengthening our team member engagement with enhanced training, improved recognition programs and more consistent team member branding.With a strong focus on increasing our relevancy with customers and driving sales productivity, we significantly expanded our merchandise selection in both food and health and beauty aids and added new consumer brands.We added tobacco products to our assortment in fiscal 2012. Based on our customer research, our customers are more likely to use tobacco products, and our customers who smoke make more shopping trips per year. With the addition of 23Table of Contentstobacco products to our assortment, we expect that we will drive trips to our stores to not only purchase tobacco products, but other products from our existing assortment while customers are in the store. At the end of fiscal 2012, tobacco products were being sold in more than 6,000 of our stores. We made significant progress in increasing our penetration of private brands. In fiscal 2012, private brands sales increased by approximately 9% over fiscal 2011. Private brands consumable sales performed especially well, increasing by 16% over fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, private brands sales represented approximately 25% of total sales and approximately 17% of total consumable sales.Fiscal 2013 OutlookBuilding on the improvements we made over the past several years, we plan to continue to execute on our initiatives designed to increase our relevancy with customers, deliver profitable sales growth, and strengthen our value and convenience proposition in fiscal 2013.Our new store performance has improved significantly in the last several years as a result of the utilization of stronger site selection tools as well as enhancements driven by our strategic initiatives. During fiscal 2013, we plan to open approximately 500 new stores, which we expect will sustain our square footage growth goal of 5% to 7%, which we achieved in fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, we plan to renovate, relocate or expand approximately 850 stores.In fiscal 2012, we formed a six year, exclusive partnership with McLane Company, Inc., a highly successful supply chain services company. This partnership will allow us to carry a consistent assortment and improve our in stock levels in our refrigerated and frozen merchandise, consolidate a fragmented network of many regional wholesalers to one national wholesaler, and distribute tobacco products to our stores efficiently. All of these improvements are expected to drive additional trips into our stores. McLane will also distribute selected categories outside of refrigerated and frozen merchandise, providing flexibility to our distribution network for potential new SKUs. McLane began delivering merchandise to our stores in September 2012.Building on the momentum of private brands growth in fiscal 2012, we intend to increase our penetration of private brands even further in fiscal 2013. We expect to launch several new brands that will offer our customers more quality and value while also refreshing a few of our existing brands to broaden their appeal. We intend to drive greater awareness of our private brands program through increased marketing and visual merchandising support.To continue to deliver profitable sales, in fiscal 2013 we plan to continue to expand our Global Sourcing teams, develop stronger processes to help us integrate our sourcing activities with our category management efforts, and continue to expand our supplier network. We expect these efforts will continue to increase our profitability and help to mitigate some margin pressures.During fiscal 2013, we expect net sales to grow due to the acceleration of our new store growth and an increase in comparable stores sales. Additionally, as noted above, fiscal 2013 is a 53 week year, as compared to a 52 week year in fiscal 2012. We expect comparable store sales to increase as a result of our current strategic initiatives, as well as continued benefits from operational improvements over the past several years. We expect sales will continue to be strongest in the Consumables category as customers continue to respond favorably to our expanded merchandise selection in food and health and beauty aids as well as our introduction of tobacco products to our stores. We believe this shift to more sales of lower margin Consumables merchandise will pressure gross margin in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. However, as a result of our expectation for increased comparable store sales, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to leverage in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.24Table of ContentsResults of OperationsOur results of operations for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs: Years Ended(in thousands)August 25, 2012% of Net Sales August 27, 2011% of Net Sales August 28, 2010% of Net SalesNet sales$9,331,005 $8,547,835 $7,866,971 Cost and expenses: Cost of sales6,071,05865.1% 5,515,54064.5% 5,058,97164.3%Selling, general and administrative2,560,34627.4% 2,394,22328.0% 2,232,40228.4%Litigation charge11,5000.1% 0.0% 0.0%Cost of sales and operating expenses8,642,90492.6% 7,909,76392.5% 7,291,37392.7%Operating profit688,1017.4% 638,0727.5% 575,5987.3%Investment income9270.0% 1,5320.0% 1,5970.0%Interest expense25,0900.3% 22,4460.3% 13,3370.2%Income before income taxes663,9387.1% 617,1587.2% 563,8587.2%Income taxes241,6982.6% 228,7132.7% 205,7232.6%Net Income$422,2404.5% $388,4454.5% $358,1354.6%Comparison of Fiscal 2012 to Fiscal 2011 Net SalesNet sales increased 9.2% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The net sales increase in fiscal 2012 reflects an increase in comparable store sales of 4.7%, with the balance of the increase due primarily to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Comparable store sales include stores that have been open more than 13 months. Stores that have been renovated, relocated or expanded are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent that they had sales during comparable weeks in each year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.The 4.7% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2012 resulted from increases in both customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, and the dollar value of the average customer transaction. During fiscal 2012, the customer count increased approximately 2.7%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 2.0% compared to fiscal 2011. Sales during fiscal 2012 were strongest in the Consumables category.During fiscal 2012, we opened 475 stores and closed 56 stores for a net addition of 419 stores, compared with the opening of 300 stores and closing of 62 stores for a net addition of 238 stores during fiscal 2011.Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 10.1% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was due primarily to additional sales volume. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 65.1% in fiscal 2012 compared to 64.5% in fiscal 2011. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was negatively impacted by the shift in sales mix to lower margin consumable merchandise, an increase in inventory shrinkage, and higher markdowns. These pressures were partially offset by an increase in the markups on the sales of merchandise. The growth in sales of lower margin consumables (69.0% of net sales in fiscal 2012 compared with 66.5% of net sales in fiscal 2011) continues to pressure gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Inventory shrinkage increased during fiscal 2012 as a result of increased activities in the stores including renovations and significant merchandise expansions. We continue to use markdowns in our stores to drive revenue growth during challenging macro economic times as well as increase market share. We continue to focus on improving our purchase markups through the continued development of our private brand assortment, the expansion of our global sourcing efforts, and improved price management capabilities.25Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG&A expenses increased 6.9% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in these expenses was due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 27.4% in fiscal 2012 compared to 28.0% in fiscal 2011. Most expenses in fiscal 2012 were leveraged as a result of a 4.7% increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements. In addition, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were leveraged as a result of a decrease in store payroll costs (approximately 0.3% of net sales) and a decrease in insurance expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales). These improvements were partially offset by increased marketing expense (approximately 0.1% of net sales) in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease in store payroll costs was a result of the continued benefit from improvements implemented to re engineer many of our core store processes, which has increased workforce productivity. Insurance expense continues to benefit from favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability costs reflecting improvements we have made in our store operations and risk management processes. Our marketing expense increased as a percentage of net sales as we expanded our customer communications, leveraged various marketing vehicles and improved our marketing and promotional materials. Litigation ChargeDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded an $11.5 million (approximately $0.06 per diluted share) litigation charge associated with the preliminary settlement of a lawsuit in the state of New York. This lawsuit involves claims for overtime pay from New York store managers who worked in our stores over the past nine years. See note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Investment IncomeThe change in investment income in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was not material.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased $2.6 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. On January 28, 2011, we issued $300 million in senior unsecured notes with a coupon rate of 5.00% maturing in 2021 (the 2021 Notes). The interest in interest expense in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was primarily driven by the interest expense on the 2021 Notes. Income TaxesThe effective tax rate was 36.4% for fiscal 2012 compared to 37.1% in fiscal 2011. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was due primarily to foreign tax benefits realized in connection with the Companys global sourcing efforts and a decrease in liabilities for uncertain tax positions.Comparison of Fiscal 2011 to Fiscal 2010 Net SalesNet sales increased 8.7% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The net sales increase in fiscal 2011 reflects an increase in comparable store sales of 5.5%, with the balance of the increase due primarily to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program.The 5.5% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2011 resulted from increases in both customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, and the dollar value of the average customer transaction. During fiscal 2011, the customer count increased approximately 4.0%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.5% compared to fiscal 2010. Sales during fiscal 2011 were strongest in the Consumables category.During fiscal 2011, we opened 300 stores and closed 62 stores for a net addition of 238 stores, compared with the opening of 200 stores and closing of 70 stores for a net addition of 130 stores during fiscal 2010.Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 9.0% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was due primarily to additional sales volume. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 64.5% in fiscal 2011 compared to 64.3% in fiscal 2010. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was a result of the impact of stronger sales in lower margin consumables merchandise and increased freight costs. These pressures were partially offset by lower inventory shrinkage and an increase in the markup of sales of merchandise. The growth in sales of lower margin consumables 26Table of Contents(66.5% of net sales in fiscal 2011 compared with 65.1% of net sales in fiscal 2010) pressured gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Freight costs were negatively impacted by higher diesel costs. We believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from workforce stabilization in our stores and improved analytics and monitoring processes. We continue to focus on improving our purchase mark ups through our price management, the continued development of our private brand assortment, and our global sourcing efforts.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG&A expenses increased 7.2% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in these expenses was due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.0% in fiscal 2011 compared to 28.4% in fiscal 2010. Most expenses in fiscal 2011 were leveraged as a result of a 5.5% increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements. The increased comparable store sales volumes helped offset our investments to drive revenue growth, including store renovations, extended store hours and enhanced marketing efforts. In addition, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were leveraged as a result of lower non store payroll costs, including incentive compensation expense, (approximately 0.3% of net sales) in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Reflecting our pay for performance philosophy, incentive compensation costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our relative performance against our target in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010.Investment IncomeThe change in investment income in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was not material.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased $9.1 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. On January 28, 2011, we issued $300 million in senior unsecured notes with a coupon rate of 5.00% maturing in 2021 (the 2021 Notes). During fiscal 2011, we incurred $8.9 million in interest expense related to the 2021 Notes. We did not incur any interest expense during fiscal 2010 related to the 2021 Notes.Income TaxesThe effective tax rate was 37.1% for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2010. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was due primarily to an increase in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and increases in valuation allowances, partially offset by an increase in federal jobs tax credits. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2012 was $369.4 million compared to $528.1 million in fiscal 2011, and $591.5 million in fiscal 2010. Our operating cash flows and credit facilities are more than sufficient to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, share repurchases, cash dividend payments, and principal and interest payments. We have availability under our two credit facilities to borrow up to $700 million (less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for our insurance programs of $26.1 million) to supplement operating cash flows. During fiscal 2012, to help supplement our operating cash flows and to support the build of inventory for the holiday season and other growth initiatives, we borrowed under our credit facilities from time to time and the balance was never greater than $75.0 million. As of the end of fiscal 2012, we had $15.0 million outstanding under the credit facilities. Working capital at the end of fiscal 2012 was $702.5 million compared to $516.8 million as of the end of fiscal 2011. We believe operating cash flows and capacity under existing credit facilities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives.Sale Leaseback TransactionsDuring fiscal 2012, we completed two sale leaseback transactions under which we sold 276 stores and received net proceeds of $359.7 million. Concurrent with these sales, we entered into agreements to lease the properties back from the purchasers over an initial lease term of 15 years. The master leases for each transaction includes an initial term of 15 years and four, five year renewal options and provides for the Company to evaluate each store individually upon certain events during the life of the lease, including individual renewal options. The leases for all stores qualify for operating lease treatment for accounting purposes.27Table of ContentsRestricted Cash and InvestmentsWe have restricted cash and investments to serve as collateral for certain of our insurance obligations that are held at our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. These restricted funds cannot be withdrawn from our account without the consent of the secured party. As of August 25, 2012, we held $55.3 million in this restricted account, of which $45.9 million was included in Restricted Cash and Investments and $9.4 million was included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The classification between current and non current is based on the timing of expected payments of the secured insurance obligations. Previously, these obligations were collateralized using standby letters of credit under our revolving credit facilities. We made this change to achieve savings in the cost of collateralizing our insurance obligations.Additionally, in conjunction with the sale leaseback transactions completed during the second half of fiscal 2012, certain proceeds of the transaction were placed into an escrow account with an independent third party in connection with like kind exchange transactions, which permits the deferral of a portion of the tax gain associated with the sale of the stores. We intend to use these proceeds to purchase additional new stores and must do so within 180 days from the closing of the transactions to realize the deferral. At the Companys option, the proceeds can be returned for general operating needs; however, the tax gain deferral would not be realized. As of August 25, 2012, the balance of this account was $80.4 million. These assets are classified as Restricted Cash and Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Fee Development ProgramWe occupy most of our stores under operating leases. As part of our new store growth strategy, we have created a Fee Development Program (Fee Development Program), intended to provide us with a more cost effective means to finance the construction of new store locations. Previously, developers would use their own capital to fund the construction of new sites, which they would then lease to us. Under the new program, we work with select developers to construct the new sites using our own investment grade credit rating to achieve a lower all in cost. Upon completion of construction we own the stores. We intend to continue to use sale leaseback transactions as a source of capital, providing additional liquidity for the Fee Development Program. As a result, we expect to achieve a lower cost of occupancy when compared to the previous program. During fiscal 2012, we purchased stores at a cost of $135.3 million under this program.Credit FacilitiesOn November 17, 2010, we entered into a new four year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $400 million. The credit facility matures on November 17, 2014, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The credit facility replaced the previous 364 day $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility.On August 17, 2011, we entered into a new five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $300 million. The credit facility matures on August 17, 2016, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The credit facility replaced the previous five year $200 million unsecured credit facility. During fiscal 2012, we borrowed a total of $362.3 million from time to time under the credit facilities at a weighted average interest rate of 1.6%. As of August 25, 2012, we had $15.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities. There were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities as of August 27, 2011. The credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 25, 2012, we were in compliance with all such covenants.Long Term DebtOn January 28, 2011, we issued $300 million of 5.00% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2021 (the 2021 Notes) in a public offering. Our proceeds were approximately $298.5 million, net of an issuance discount of $1.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of approximately $3.3 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2021 Notes. We may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at our option, subject to a make whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the 2021 Notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.On September 27, 2005, we obtained $250 million through a private placement of unsecured senior notes due September 27, 2015 (the 2015 Notes), to a group of institutional accredited investors. The 2015 Notes were issued in two 28Table of Contentstranches at par and rank pari passu in right of payment with our other unsecured senior indebtedness. The first tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $169 million, is payable in a single installment on September 27, 2015, and bears interest at a rate of 5.41% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, matures on September 27, 2015, with amortization commencing on September 27, 2011, and bears interest at a rate of 5.24% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche requires a principal payment of $16.2 million on September 27th of each year through 2015. The 2015 Notes contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 25, 2012, we were in compliance with all such covenants.Principal PaymentDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we made a scheduled principal payment on our private placement notes in the amount of $16.2 million. The next principal payment of $16.2 million was paid in September 2012.Other ConsiderationsOur merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2012 were 23.5% higher than at the end of fiscal 2011. Inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2011 was 16.6% higher than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2011. The increases were due primarily to the expansion of our assortment of consumable merchandise.Capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 were $603.3 million, compared with $345.3 million in fiscal 2011, and $212.4 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was due primarily to increased new store openings (including stores opened under our Fee Development Program), the completion of the construction of our tenth distribution center, investments in fixtures to support our expanded assortment of consumables, and investments related to renovations, relocations and expansions. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was due primarily to the investments we made to drive revenue growth, including our comprehensive store renovation program, other improvements and upgrades to existing stores, purchases of new and existing stores, and supply chain projects. In fiscal 2011, we purchased 44 stores, including existing stores from our landlords and the construction of new stores, compared to 20 existing stores purchased from our landlords in fiscal 2010.Capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 are expected to be between $600 and $650 million. The planned capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 are primarily made up of continued investments in new stores, including expenditures related to our Fee Development Program, investments related to renovations, relocations and expansions and the completion of the construction of our 11th distribution center. We plan to open approximately 500 new stores and renovate, relocate or expand approximately 850 stores in fiscal 2012.During fiscal 2012, we purchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $191.6 million, compared to 13.9 million shares at a cost of $670.5 million in fiscal 2011, and 9.4 million shares at a cost of $332.2 million in fiscal 2010. On September 28, 2011, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to an additional $250 million of the Companys outstanding common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2012, the Company had $145.7 million remaining under current authorizations.The timing and amount of any shares repurchased have been and will continue to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our share repurchase programs do not have a stated expiration date, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions.In addition to the Restricted Cash and Investments noted above, our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary maintains additional balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities that are used in connection with our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks and are not designated for general corporate purposes. As of the end of fiscal 2012, these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances (including Restricted Cash and Investments) were $19.0 million, and $85.3 million, respectively.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities decreased $158.7 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in merchandise inventories in fiscal 2012 as noted above, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which was offset partially by changes in prepayments and other current assets and higher net income, all in the ordinary course of business.Cash provided by operating activities decreased $63.5 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in merchandise inventories primarily offset by changes in other liabilities and higher 29Table of Contentsnet income, all in the ordinary course of business.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities decreased $82.1 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. The change was due to the net proceeds received from the sale leaseback transaction of $359.7 million, offset partially by an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 are discussed above.Cash used in investing activities decreased $26.5 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. The change was due primarily to a net increase in sales of investment securities in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $132.8 million. The net increase in sales of investment securities was due to the continued liquidation of our auction rate securities and the increase in capital expenditures as discussed above.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities decreased $268.9 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. We purchased $191.6 million of our common stock during fiscal 2012 as compared to $670.5 million in fiscal 2011, a decrease in share repurchases of $478.9 million. In addition, during fiscal 2011, we issued $300 million of 5.00% unsecured senior notes, creating a significant cash inflow from financing activities in fiscal 2011, which offset the decrease in share repurchases. Cash used in financing activities increased $148.3 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and changes in cash overdrafts, partially offset by the issuance of new debt. During fiscal 2011, we purchased $670.5 million of our common stock, as compared to $332.2 million in fiscal 2010. Cash overdrafts decreased $47.7 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to an increase of $49.7 million in fiscal 2010. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for an explanation of our cash overdrafts. Additionally, as noted above, in fiscal 2011 we issued $300 million of 5.00% unsecured senior notes, creating a significant cash inflow from financing activities as compared to fiscal 2010.Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2012.

Most of our operating leases provide us with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates. See Part IItem 2Properties in this Report.As of August 25, 2012, we had $22.4 million in liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. At this time, we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities, except for $8.3 million, which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next 12 months. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our tax liabilities.The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2012. 30Table of ContentsOther Commercial Commitments (in thousands)Total AmountsCommittedStandby letters of credit$26,054Surety bonds46,529Total$72,583A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion.We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent purchase authorizations that can be canceled. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases included in the Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments section above.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update 2011 04 Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011 04). ASU 2011 04 amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 in fiscal 2012 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011 05 Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05). ASU 2011 05 allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. While ASU 2011 05 changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 12 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05 (ASU 2011 12). ASU 2011 12 deferred certain aspects of ASU 2011 05. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 and ASU 2011 12 in fiscal 2012 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting PoliciesOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Merchandise Inventories:Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less mark on percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of sales when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge 31Table of Contentsto record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was $58.8 million as of the end of fiscal 2012 and $48.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2011. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts. Stores receive a physical inventory at least annually. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2012.Property and Equipment:We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally five or ten years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, our impairment losses on fixed assets, which typically relate to normal store closings, have not been material to our financial position and results of operations. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal 2012. See Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on property and equipment.Insurance Liabilities:We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense, which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations.We record our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis, and record a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset are separated into current and non current amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Our total liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs were $236.7 million ($52.0 million current and $184.6 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2012, and $249.6 million ($56.4 million current and $193.2 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2011. The current portion of the liabilities is included in Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in Other Liabilities. The insurance assets related to these amounts totaled $34.8 million ($2.9 million current and $31.9 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2012, and $36.7 million ($3.0 million current and $33.7 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2011. The current portion of the assets is included in prepayments and Other Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in Other Assets. There were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011. Our insurance expense during fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs. See our discussion of SG&A expenses under Results of Operations above for more information.Contingent Income Tax Liabilities:We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business and we record contingent income tax liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were $22.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2012, and $26.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2011. 32Table of ContentsThere were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal 2012. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities.Contingent Legal Liabilities:We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our total legal liabilities were not material as of the end of fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2012. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities.Stock based Compensation Expense:We measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The determination of the fair value of our employee stock options on the grant date is calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued. If factors change and we employ different assumptions to measure stock based compensation in future periods, the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. Our results for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 include stock based compensation expense of $15.9 million, $14.7 million and $15.7 million, respectively. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2012. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on stock based compensation.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applied to the average daily borrowings under our credit facility. As of August 25, 2012, the analysis indicated that such a movement would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, we incurred an immaterial amount of interest expense related to our credit facilities. We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment securities. Our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid. As of August 25, 2012, we had a $2.1 million unrealized loss ($1.3 million net of taxes) related to these investments. We believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer calls or refinancings, repurchases by the broker dealers, or upon maturity. However, volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information.33Table of Contents
